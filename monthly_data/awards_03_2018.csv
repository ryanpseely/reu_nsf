To increase national security for the U.S. and meet its workforce needs, cybersecurity education must develop new knowledge and skills. To address this need, the Cyber Up! Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) project at Coastline Community College in California will research, create, adapt, adopt, and implement a suite of course content that supports a Certificate of Achievement and an Associate of Science degree. As a Center for Academic Excellence-Two Year (CAE2Y), the implementation of DFIR has the potential to be transformative, bringing about needed and important change to U.S. education and security. Thus, the program expects to increase the availability and readiness of qualified cybersecurity technicians in the U.S. workforce, resulting in greater global competitiveness for the U.S. economy and increased national security. A comprehensive project evaluation will measure the DFIR program's effectiveness, which will in turn support adaptation and replication by other institutions. <br/><br/>The project will focus on the development of curricula that will teach students and professionals the cybersecurity knowledge and skills of digital forensics and incident response, which need to be deployed in real-time and are dynamic to changing situations during and in response to cyberattacks. Through the DFIR program, the project intends to create adoptable educational resources; form academic, government, and industry partnerships; and prepare qualified cybersecurity technicians and professionals for entry into, or advancement within, the U.S. workforce. The DFIR distance education modalities will be designed for a national reach and assist in preparing students for successful employment. It will work towards providing cybersecurity advancement through its various modalities since the content, courses, certificate, and degree will all be available online. The project will also develop virtual labs and faculty resources. The DFIR program will aim to reach educators, institutions, and diverse populations with important new knowledge and skills in digital forensics and incident response. Faculty development will provide educators new knowledge and enhance their abilities in these new technological and pedagogical skill-sets, leading to enriched educational structures at the institution. Because of the adoptable, modular content, other institutions can benefit through adoption into their programs, creating pathways to greater skills and knowledge for students and professionals. Increasing skills and knowledge in diverse and underrepresented populations in cybersecurity will help to assure increased participation of women, minorities, and special populations in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education and in the STEM workforce. Thus, the program will strive to generate important new knowledge and skills to share with students, professionals, and the academic community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The spillage of dense water over the Denmark Strait sill into the main North Atlantic basin, contributes to a global circulation that distributes heat over the globe. In addition, warm water from the deep Atlantic basin intrudes into the cold fjords along the Greenland coast, where it melts glaciers and thus contributes to global sea level rise and potentially to changes in the regional ocean circulation. The intensity of these flows varies with a frequency of several days and the cause of this variability is not known. The main goal of this project is to determine the underlying dynamics causing this variability, and specifically the role played by waves known as coastal-trapped waves. Shedding light on what causes this dominant mode of variability, this work will aid to improve climate predictions and help design observational monitoring programs in the region. The results from this work will benefit physical oceanographers and climate scientists, as it will provide a fundamental understanding of variability in key climatic processes operating in Greenland. The project will support a female early career scientist, the training of a graduate student in numerical ocean modeling, and undergraduate student education through the development of individual research projects. <br/><br/>Mid-depth and deep exchange flows along the southeast Greenland coast play a key role in the global climate system. Recent observational evidence of two such exchange flows (the deep Denmark Strait Overflow and fjord-shelf exchange in the mid-depth range) suggests that they are both governed by sub-inertial variability (time scale of several days). Furthermore, our preliminary results suggest that variability in the Denmark Strait Overflow and fjord-shelf exchange along the southeast Greenland coast are connected, which leads us to propose that they should be studied holistically. Despite sub-inertial variations being ubiquitous along the southeast Greenland coast, the underlying dynamics of these variations are not clear. We hypothesize that they are the imprint of coastal-trapped waves, and will study their properties, forcing mechanisms and impact on exchange flows using a combination of realistic high-resolution numerical model simulations and idealized process studies, synthesized with existing observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems directly interact with the physical world, so a successful attack can have serious consequences: for instance, a compromised chemical plant could have severe environmental consequences, and a compromised medical device could result in injury or death. Contemporary security mechanisms, however, can be inadequate for at two reasons. First, current defenses tend to be quite heavyweight, which makes them difficult to apply to resource-constrained infrastructure systems. And second, timing is critical: current defenses tend to focus on preventing systems from 'doing the wrong thing' or 'failing to do the right thing', as opposed to preventing systems from 'doing the right thing at the wrong time', which is often just as damaging. To address this problem, this project creates stronger defense mechanisms tailored specifically for infrastructure systems. The new mechanisms explicitly take timing into account, are expected to have lower cost, and will initially be applied to automotive systems in collaboration with a major car manufacturer. The principal investigator will organize tutorials for practitioners, and will enhance the curriculum of the Master's in Embedded Systems program at the University of Pennsylvania with more coverage of Internet-of-Things security. She is also developing a series of outreach activities to improve the representation of women and minorities in the real-time systems community. Collaborations with the law school and the medical school at the University of Pennsylvania will investigate how to use the new techniques to improve the legal framework for infrastructure systems, by offering better accountability for product defects, for example, and how to apply them to improve the security of medical systems. <br/><br/>This project pursues an approach called bounded-time recovery. Unlike many existing techniques, bounded time recovery does not attempt to mask all symptoms of an attack, which existing defenses do at great cost; rather, it leverages the fact that many systems cannot change their state arbitrarily quickly, due to properties such as inertia or thermal capacity, and can thus already tolerate brief disruptions, provided the system quickly returns to a correct state. This approach seeks guarantees that 1) the system will meet its timing requirements in the absence of an attack, and that 2) when under attack, the system will return to a correct state within a bounded amount of time, potentially after reconfiguring itself to exclude compromised nodes. The goal is to provide these guarantees in the Byzantine model, that is, without a priori knowledge of what the attacks will look like, or which nodes will be attacked. To achieve this goal, the project will construct practical algorithms for (provably) detecting attacks within bounded time, based on techniques such as tamper-evident logs and cryptographic evidence; create methods for recovering from detected attacks within bounded time, using ideas from multi-mode systems; and produce reusable implementations of the new techniques that will be widely disseminated and made available under an open-source license.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent events, both domestically and internationally, have highlighted the critical nature of foundation resilience in ensuring continued infrastructure function following natural disasters.  The framework to be developed will be capable of providing next-generation resistance formulations for infrastructure foundations capable of reliably and holistically assessing the behavior and response of deep foundations under multiaxial loading.  The framework will offer more accurate and parsimonious design solutions which will reduce overdesign, and require less material.   It will spur the introduction and implementation of novel instrumentation technologies and sustainable materials.  In addition, research findings will accelerate the transition to use of high-performance materials with permanently integrated integrity assessment capabilities by providing a validated design platform to accurately characterize foundation response behavior. This will potentially result in substantial reductions in the cost of building foundations. The CAREER educational objectives focus on stimulating interdisciplinary curiosity and growth through diverse curricular efforts and industry involvement in geo-structural undergraduate and graduate classroom training. It will cater to the increasing demand for technical rigor and a global mindset in engineering graduates.  Professional career development activities will supplement the technical educational activities to increase the retention of diversity in geo-structural engineering in academia and industry, and stimulate a lifelong interest in research and development.  The latter part of the educational plan will specifically target female engineers, and is aligned with NSF INCLUDES.<br/><br/>The core of the CAREER research consists of executing well-coordinated, large-scale experimental- and risk-informed numerical simulations to generate baseline knowledge that aids the development of integrated, performance-based assessment metrics.  Specifically, this research will enable the (i) derivation of robust, next-generation loading-response formulations; (ii) development of creative experimental tools to holistically evaluate damage evolution; (iii) validation of models for design and post-hazard integrity analyses, and (iv) risk-driven sensitivity studies to connect all components into a unified decision-making framework.  In addition, the experimental studies will fill vital data gaps through prototype-scale testing of soil-pile systems for which limited research has been performed, i.e., specifically targeting piles with complex structural fixity conditions at the pile head and pile tip.  Another aspect of the research will develop innovative experimental tools to improve our fundamental understanding of complex three-dimensional (3D) soil-structure interaction (SSI) by extracting volumetric measurements in deep foundation systems via 3D printed, cast in place instrumentation technologies.  The research program will benefit the profession by implementing new understanding in software tools usable for individual component and system analysis for a broad spectrum of infrastructure beyond deep foundations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An alternate approach is to learn behaviors through experience, a type of machine learning known as ``reinforcement learning'', where the robot learns through trial and error. Pure trial and error, however, is inefficient, which means it takes the robot a long time to learn.  The goal of this project is to enable robots to focus attention on the parts of the environment that lead to effective learning and good generalization to new tasks.  A result of this research is the ability of assistive robots in the home, such as an assistive wheelchair equipped with a robotic arm, to learn how to better help the infirm and people with disabilities.<br/><br/>This project will develop a new approach to applying deep reinforcement learning (deep RL) to robotic manipulation problems by incorporating deictic representations. A deictic representation encodes state/action relative to a marker that the agent places in the environment. In this project, the marker is a 6-DOF reference frame, placed in a 3-D point cloud, or truncated signed distance function. The robot decides where to place the marker and how it should move relative to that marker by solving a Markov decision process using deep reinforcement learning. Preliminary results suggest that this new method can enable robots to learn control policies that solve complex manipulation problems without the need for precise geometric models of the objects being manipulated. While the method still estimates some elements of object pose implicitly, it does so in a way that generalizes well to novel objects and does not necessarily estimate full object pose unless required by the task.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports an integrated research and education effort on developing and applying computational methods for understanding how nonlinear optical materials respond to light. How nonlinear optical materials respond to light depends on the intensity of the light which leads to interesting phenomena that can be used in technological applications. For example, the dependence of the index of refraction on light intensity can cause a nonlinear optical material to function like a lens causing a light beam to narrow or collapse as it passes through the material. <br/>These materials have applications in, for example, noninvasive imaging for medicine, optoelectronic devices, and advanced sensitive quantum mechanical sensors.

This award supports an integrated research and education effort on developing and applying predictive first-principles methods for understanding nonlinear optical responses of materials. Materials and nanostructures with tailored nonlinear optical properties are not only important for understanding, probing, and ultimately controlling light-matter interaction at the nanoscale, but highly desirable for many applications such as ultrafast nonlinear optics, biosensing, all-optical transistor and computer, and optical quantum teleportation, communication, and computing. Recently, giant nonlinear optical processes such as second and third harmonic generation were discovered in two-dimensional crystals and topological materials, which challenges the current understanding and requires fundamental investigation at the microscopic level. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to advance fundamental understanding and theoretical prediction of nonlinear light-matter interaction in materials. The research will focus on developing and applying first-principles density-functional-based methods and approaches to investigate and eventually predict second and third order nonlinear optical responses of materials. Spin-orbit coupling, crystalline symmetry, causality, electron-hole interaction, quasiparticle energy, and quasiparticle lifetime due to carrier-carrier and carrier-phonon interactions will be included in this first-principles theoretical framework. Particular emphasis will be placed on elucidating the role of symmetry, electronic topology, surface/edge, and spin-orbit coupling in two-dimensional materials and topological materials. The results obtained will generate new knowledge of nonlinear optical processes and contribute materials design principles for control of light-matter interactions.<br/><br/>To integrate outreach and education with the research, the PI will host and train high-school students from under-represented groups and secondary school teachers in scientific computing and simulations during summers to motivate the aspiration and curiosity of the students in science and engineering.

The graduate students working on this project will acquire a solid interdisciplinary background in physics, materials science, and high-performance computing. In addition, the computational methods, codes, and data generated from this project will be broadly disseminated to the scientific community, the industry, and the general public through open-source distributions with the intent to benefit the broader research, education, and outreach in the community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Safety is ensured by designing our aerospace, civil, and marine structures to withstand operational, environmental, and expected or unexpected extreme loads throughout their designed service lifetimes, and now many such structures are being pushed to serve society well past their design life. Although the structural health monitoring (SHM) field has brought new technologies, algorithms, and methods to improve damage detection, quantification, and assessment, what is missing is the ability to translate detected damage data into actionable information for stakeholders and owners to act on to ensure structural safety and performance, given relevant constraints. Information obtained through this new paradigm of Designing for Safety is crucial for informing design, repair, retrofit, and/or replacement of other existing similar structures or for future, new designs, thereby feeding back to attain the vision of Safety by Design. This research will directly address the challenge of acquiring and interpreting appropriate data streams (whether obtained through numerical modeling, experimental tests, and/or operational measurements) to synthesize information and create actionable knowledge that will enable accurate assessment and improvement of structural design, health, and performance. To achieve this goal, this REU Site at the University of California San Diego (UCSD) will recruit and train 12 diverse U.S. scholars for eight weeks each summer, recruited from across the nation with emphasis on broadening the participation of underrepresented minority, women, and economically-disadvantaged students. These students will conduct research alongside six professors and their graduate students. In addition to immersing REU students in an intensive summer research program, a plethora of career development, lab tours, graduate school application preparation, seminars, and social activities are also planned to provide each U.S. scholar with a life-changing, multidisciplinary, summer experience. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this NSF REU Site is to immerse students in a meaningful and highly interdisciplinary research environment within the structural engineering domain and to teach them that design does not end with construction. Instead, designing for safety embodies: quantifying potential load conditions, damage mechanics, and uncertainties; monitoring for anomalies during operations; processing this information through cyber-modeling via digital surrogates; and translating the information to actionable knowledge for improving current and future system designs. First, from concept inception to defining performance metrics to structural design, transformative research and education are needed to devise methods for aggregating and fusing computational and experimental data to inform the capabilities of different designs and the probabilities of exceeding certain safety-states. Second, once deployed, SHM/prognosis is central to achieving total structural state awareness through the integration of sensing data from multiple sources (""Internet-of-Things""), cyber modeling, and statistical pattern recognition. Finally, information acquired throughout design and operations, when combined with innovative optimization methods and a multi-scale, multi-physics, digital surrogate twin of the structure, is crucial for realizing future structural designs that outperform its predecessors. Research results generated through this project will bridge key knowledge gaps revealing the interrelations between damage formation, propagation, detection, structural modeling, model-updating, assessment, and design optimization. The planned student activities will equip young U.S. scholars with multidisciplinary technical skills and diverse perspectives so that they are uniquely poised to tackle complex, interdisciplinary, and systems-level grand challenges throughout their entire careers. The students' contributions to research and their summer experiences will raise awareness and stimulate interests in pursuing future STEM careers, which will stimulate a positive feedback loop so that novel solutions for Designing for Safety and Safety by Design will arrive sooner rather than later. UC San Diego is uniquely positioned to host this REU Site, since it is the only institution in the U.S. with programs in SHM and prognosis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many types of pollutants are poorly removed by existing wastewater treatment technologies. As a result, pollutants accumulate in aquatic environments and may contaminate drinking water resources. The PI will study the mechanisms by which organic pollutants are transformed during wastewater treatment through detailed characterization of the complex organic matter in wastewater using advanced chemical analysis tools. This information will be coupled with next generation genetic characterization of the microbes responsible for pollutant removal to allow optimization of wastewater treatment plant performance to more efficiently remove pollutants and decrease cost. The education plan for this project will train a diverse group of students to broaden participation in environmental engineering and other STEM fields.<br/><br/>The occurrence of anthropogenic organic micropollutants in wastewater treatment plant effluents raises concerns about their human-health and ecological impacts. As wastewater reclamation and recycling become more widely adopted, efficient and cost-effective means for micropollutant removal are becoming essential. This research seeks to leverage the broad metabolic capabilities of wastewater microbial communities to achieve this goal. The research will utilize high-resolution mass spectrometry to broadly infer the metabolic functioning of microbial communities and next-generation sequencing to characterize the structure of microbial communities from population to functional levels with a goal of identifying taxa, ecological features, metabolic pathways, or operational parameters that lead to enhanced micropollutant biotransformation. This research is significant because it will provide wastewater utilities with an effective means for optimizing bioprocesses to meet emerging performance objectives. The PI will create opportunities for diverse groups of students across all education levels to engage with water quality research through a collaboration with the Cayuga Lake Floating Classroom for pre-college students, recruit undergraduate students to work on the research plan through the NSF-funded Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation program, and integrate research and education activities in the undergraduate environmental engineering curriculum at Cornell University.

Much research in dynamical systems focuses on closed systems in which the dynamics are self-contained.  In many modeling situations, however, such a global view is not possible and it becomes necessary to study local systems that are influenced by other unknown systems, possibly on different scales.  These considerations motivate many of the systems to be studied during the course of this award:  systems in which mass or energy may enter or exit through deterministic or random mechanisms, and large-scale systems of smaller interacting components that exchange mass or energy.  Such systems have been used in theoretical physics and chemical engineering to model atom traps, explore mechanisms for heat conduction in solids and investigate metastability in molecular processes.  Rigorous mathematical results obtained during the course of this award will aid in the interpretation of these studies as well as suggest new directions of inquiry.  This award also supports the involvement of undergraduates in mathematics research.  Using the highly visual nature and physical motivation of the problems outlined above, the PI will recruit undergraduate students to work on these topics during each summer funded by the award.  Special emphasis will be given to recruiting students from underrepresented groups in research mathematics.  Students will disseminate results of their research via poster sessions, conference presentations and publications in peer-reviewed journals.  By stimulating interest in research careers in mathematics and creating a peer community supportive of that interest, the award will contribute to the important goal of integrating research and education.<br/><br/>Motivated by the problems outlined above, this award is organized around three specific projects:  The first project investigates the statistical properties of both classical and non-equilibrium particle systems with collision interactions, an important class of models from statistical mechanics; the second concerns open systems, which relate on the one hand to models of physical systems in which mass or energy is allowed to escape, and on the other to the study of metastable states; the third project concerns the behavior of extended dynamical systems comprised of a finite or infinite number of smaller components linked together, with orbits or energy allowed to pass between them.  Important examples include the aperiodic Lorentz gas and mechanical models of heat conduction.  Using his recent work concerning spectral decompositions of transfer operators for dispersing particle systems, the PI will investigate equilibrium and non-equilibrium models from statistical mechanics and provide rigorous analysis of physically important quantities such as entropy production.  In addition, the PI will adapt and develop techniques using projective cones due to Birkhoff as well as the construction of Markov extensions (a generalization of Markov partitions) to the study of such systems.  None of these techniques require Markovian assumptions on the dynamics, making them widely applicable to a wide variety of nonuniformly hyperbolic and physically important systems.  The application of these tools to central models from equilibrium and non-equilibrium statistical mechanics will represent significant advances in the study of such systems.  Efforts to understand these tools in one context, strengthens them and aids in their application to other areas of mathematics.  Their intellectual interest is enhanced by the application of these ideas to resolve problems posed and approached formally in the physics literature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address this urgent need various assistive robots have been developed to improve gait training outcomes, and impedance control (controlling the force of resistance to external motions that are produced by the environment) has been widely employed in these robots to ensure safe human-robot interaction.  However, it is difficult to personalize the virtual impedance for such robots due to the complex nature of human neurological and musculoskeletal dynamics.  On the other hand, a physical therapist can provide adaptive assistance to a patient at the correct moment in a gait cycle based on real-time sensory feedback and clinical experience.  Inspired by this observation, one could imagine designing an assistive robot control system by learning from therapists' demonstrations, but such a purely data-driven approach could lead to significantly degraded performance with new gait patterns, which creates safety risks for users. This research will develop a hybrid assistive robot control approach, which integrates model-based impedance control with machine learning from therapists' behaviors so that the resultant robot assistance is safe yet adaptive.  Project outcomes will include a novel algorithm framework for physical human-robot collaboration that exhibits both performance guarantees due to the model-based control and intelligent adaptation resulting from robot learning.  The new technology will have a wide range of applications in many other safety-critical human-robot collaboration scenarios, including collaborative manufacturing, (semi) autonomous driving, and service robots.  The broader impacts of the work will be further enhanced by tight integration of the research with educational activities including new modules in existing robotics classes, research opportunities for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, and internships for local high-school students.<br/>  <br/>The scientific contribution of the work will include: 1) integration of heterogeneous wearable sensor data to build the robot learning model from therapists' demonstrations, and human knee impedance characterization to build the robot impedance control model; 2) a robot planning approach based on a fusion of learning from demonstration and impedance control, with the weights determined by the degree of confidence in the robot learning model; and 3) automatic requests for new demonstration data and incorporation of subject feedback to refine both the robot learning and impedance control models.  Performance of the approach will be assessed in biomechanical simulations, in lab tests with healthy subjects, and in a pilot study with stroke and Parkinson's disease patients.  It is envisioned that project outcomes will make assistive robots highly intelligent so that a therapist could work with multiple patients simultaneously and even remotely, which could significantly reduce both the therapists' labor intensity and cost of rehabilitation training for patients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the path to AM as a viable and safe alternative in applications where structural components must carry loads (in some cases, where components must sustain repetitive loading over long periods of time) is at a critical junction. The widespread incorporation of this transformative manufacturing technology is hampered by the fact that it is currently not possible to predict when and why an additively manufactured metal component might fail, and to design the component accordingly to mitigate risk of failure. This presents a major problem for many industries that are looking to use AM to produce metal load-bearing components. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to address this pressing need and to enable the expanded, yet safe, use of metal AM in many industries, including aerospace, automotive, biomedical, manufacturing, and national defense. The research is closely integrated with a unique outreach program that will engage students across different age levels and backgrounds, including middle-school students from rural locations in Utah.<br/><br/>The research supported by this CAREER award is a fundamental step toward expanding the use of AM to fatigue-critical applications through the discovery of 3D, microstructure-sensitive, fatigue-crack driving mechanisms in additively manufactured aluminum. Two parallel research thrusts will be carried out. One thrust will focus on experimentally characterizing the microstructural features in 3D neighborhoods of fatigue cracks observed in aluminum specimens produced by laser powder bed fusion. The second thrust will focus on numerically characterizing the local micromechanical fields that evolve in 3D as a function of underlying, manufacturing-induced microstructure and defect distribution, with particular focus on residual-stress incompatibility, porosity, and surface roughness. Data-driven approaches will be leveraged across the experimental and numerical data sets to provide new insights into the mechanisms responsible for fatigue failure among the specimens. While the research focuses on aluminum alloys, it is anticipated that the findings regarding the relative importance of geometrical defects, like pores and surface roughness, versus intrinsic material defects on fatigue failure of additively manufactured parts could be broadly applicable to other metals as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Consequently, they are susceptible to cyberattacks.  For example, in 2015 two hackers remotely exploited a vulnerability in an SUV's entertainment system to send the vehicle into a ditch.  Though many technological solutions to improve vehicle cybersecurity have been proposed, the PI argues real progress toward achieving that goal will require including the human (driver) in the loop.  Thus, this research will combine findings from cybersecurity and transportation safety to develop training and in-vehicle messaging systems to improve drivers' awareness of and responses to cyberattacks, which ultimately should help reduce crash-related costs and potentially save lives.  The effectiveness of the new systems will be tested in a driving simulator study.  Project outcomes will yield quantitative evidence as to how drivers respond to unintended events that occur in their vehicles.  More importantly, the work will create systems that can warn drivers of dangers associated with vehicle hacking, and provide information on how these dangerous situations can be mitigated.  Similar systems will be applicable in other transportation safety contexts (e.g., automated driving).  <br/><br/>This research will proceed in two phases.  Phase I will focus on the iterative development of the training and in-vehicle message systems using methods essential to the human-centered design process (e.g., interviews and co-design sessions).

During the experiment, drivers will be exposed to various situations that are indicative of a vehicle cyberattack while their driving behavior is recorded.

With a long-term perspective, archaeology is well-suited to assess resource management strategies because what is successful in the short-term may not be successful over hundreds or thousands of years. Turbulent times do not affect all people equally, and this project will address how degrees of access to resources change as political and ecological environments change. Throughout the course of this research project, both Belizean citizens and Northwestern University undergraduates will be trained in archaeological methods.

Important resources within the city of Aventura were pocket bajos, small non-draining depressions in the land that were either used for water management or agriculture in the past. This research will determine how pocket bajos were used and who had access to the resources they provided. The project will assess how commoner access to pocket bajo resources changed as drought and political instability increased regionally. The research team will conduct systematic excavations of a commoner household and take soil cores from a pocket bajos in Aventura. They will analyze artifacts and botanical remains to determine chronology and assess who had access to these important resources through time, as well as what configurations of power allowed for successful resource management during ecological and political instability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ongoing excavation of the site, an ancient sinkhole deposit discovered in 2000, has yielded numerous, well-preserved fossils of terrestrial plants and animals that lived approximately seven to four-and-a-half million years ago. The vegetation of this time period in the Appalachian region is significant because it predates the widespread ecological disturbance caused by Pleistocene-age environmental changes, yet its biodiversity is not well understood. Consequently, the Gray Fossil Site presents a unique opportunity to clarify how ecosystems of the Appalachian region have changed over recent geological history. Researchers will identify species of fossil fruits and seeds from the site and will describe those new to science. They will then compare the diversity of fossil plant species found at the site to that of other ancient and modern plants world-wide. The comparison may provide transformative insights regarding the pace of biological diversification, extinction, and geographic range shifts of plant species at a local to global scale. Researchers will train undergraduate students and engage the public at the Gray Fossil Site and Museum by producing a digital visitor's guide to the fossil flora. Research results will be disseminated widely and will include contributions to the NSF-funded, open access Digital Atlas of Ancient Life.<br/><br/>This project will create the first comprehensive carpoflora for the Gray Fossil Site. Researchers will analyze previously excavated fruit and seed fossils using a combination of light microscopy, scanning electron microscopy and micro-computed tomography. These methods supply complementary data that characterize both surface morphological and internal anatomical details without the need for destructive dissection. Project personnel will determine the systematic affinities of the fossils using structural characteristics and phylogenetic analyses, where feasible. They will then assess the biogeographic relationships of the carpoflora based on the taxonomy of the fossils. These data will test the hypothesis that the carpoflora will share greatest similarities to the ancient and modern floras of Eurasia and North America. Outcomes of this project will include an improved understanding of Miocene and Pliocene ecosystems of North America, the historical biogeography of the Appalachian flora, and the state of internal anatomical preservation of the Gray Fossil Site carpoflora. The project will improve the curation of US fossil collections and strengthen research collaborations among US institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project's primary goals include building institutional capacity to produce highly skilled K-12 STEM teachers, particularly for service in marginalized communities, as well as deepening partnerships with surrounding school districts. The project aims to develop an undergraduate course that will deepen preservice teachers' knowledge of STEM content and pedagogy. As a part of the new course, preservice teachers will have field experiences in culturally and linguistically diverse public schools. Preservice teacher supervisors will receive training on how to best foster STEM teaching development. The project will also create a resource library with curriculum materials and STEM related diversity-responsive literature for use by PLU students and local school partners. <br/><br/>This project seeks to build capacity to prepare highly qualified STEM teachers through (i) strong collaborations with local and regional partnerships via an advisory board and (ii) the engagement of diverse student populations in STEM learning through culturally responsive curriculum. Preservice teachers participating in the project will be undergraduates from all STEM disciplines including biology, chemistry, physics, geosciences, mathematics, and computer science. The project will develop an interdisciplinary, research-based course that includes K-8 classroom experiences to deepen students' knowledge of science content and pedagogy. Through the development of interdisciplinary partnerships, students will co-plan and teach science lessons with local K-12 teachers. Student field placements will occur in three local school districts (Tacoma, Franklin Pierce, and Clover Park) that serve diverse student populations in poverty affected communities and that are intentionally building their STEM teaching capacity. The mutually beneficial partnership between PLU and local school districts has the potential to result in authentic school and university-based experiences for PLU students. In addition to their impact on preservice teacher knowledge, these experiences aim to enhance STEM education for school district students, foster school-university STEM collaborations, enhance teaching and learning in the schools and PLU, and provide new materials and intellectual resources for local teachers. The advisory board will include members from the Puget Sound Educational Service District, the Board of the Smithsonian Science Education Center's program (Leadership and Support for Science Education Reform), PLU faculty, and the Institute for Systems Biology. Through a design-based research (DBR) approach, this project aims to generate knowledge on how to leverage collaborations to create effective STEM-focused course offerings, improve teacher preparation and development, and foster mutually beneficial partnerships. The DBR approach to bring about change involves implementing multiple iterations of design, implementation, analysis, and redesign. This project is the first iteration that will collect and analyze data such as observations, surveys, and student reflections, within the DBR context. Dissemination efforts will focus on sharing the project's results at STEM and Education conferences as well as in science education and teacher education journals, both regionally and nationally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast to conventional machining, where parts are made by cutting away unwanted material, additive manufacturing -- also called 3D printing -- builds three-dimensional objects of unprecedented complexity by progressively adding small amounts of material. Powder bed fusion (PBF), in which new material is added to the part being fabricated by applying and selectively melting a powdered feedstock, is a popular form of AM for fabricating complex metallic or high-performance polymeric parts. This project supports fundamental research to create new thermal modeling, sensing, and control algorithms that will lead to precise and reliable PBF. The modeling task will enable fast and accurate prediction of heat flow and temperature distribution during powder fusion. The resulting knowledge on directing heat flow is essential for achieving a desired three-dimensional shape. The sensing task will formulate new signal processing algorithms that discard unnecessary information to make full use of data-intensive sensor sources like high-speed video. Finally, these results will be integrated with new control algorithms in order to counteract process variations and provide repeatable, low-cost, high-quality parts. AM offers untapped potential in a wide range of products for the energy, aerospace, automotive, healthcare, and biomedical industries. PBF parts are increasingly preferred in applications ranging from advanced jet-engine components to custom-designed medical implants. Therefore, the outcomes of this project will facilitate fabrication of products to benefit the US economy and improve quality of life. Broader impacts of the project will be augmented by dissemination of educational results via a network of twenty-four collaborating universities, to inculcate skills for innovative problem solving into undergraduate engineering education.<br/> <br/>The powder bed fusion process exploits precision heating and rapid solidification, together with layer-by-layer adjustments to feedstock application, and scan speed and path of lasers or electron beams. This project will expand knowledge at the interface of modeling and process controls, to consider the main obstacles to precision manufacturing with AM. Specifically, the project will address (1) the lack of tractable online models that capture multi-scale thermomechanical interactions, and (2) the need for control strategies in the presence of limited-bandwidth sensor feedback. A dynamic real-time model will be produced through separation of the cross-scan and cross-layer dynamics, allowing currently intractable powder fusion dynamics to be treated in real time, using computation-friendly primitives. Then the structure of the process dynamics will be used to enable a feedback controller for laser energy deposition. Controlling the proper energy deposition is critical for ensuring quality and reproducibility. The approach will be based on modeling and adaptation methods originally developed in precision mechatronics, in conjunction with a formulation of multi-rate control that can reject structured thermal disturbances at a fast, user-configurable sampling rate. Collectively, the project will add the needed new knowledge on quality assurance to future repetitive and layer-by-layer thermomechanical processes, by (1) establishing a physics-based, control-oriented modeling approach to understand and engineer the layered thermal interactions, and by (2) creating a foundation for closed-loop control solutions to produce desired uniform temperature fields in periodic and near-periodic deposition of thermal energy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the need to propagate uncertainty through the system when estimating state-of-the-art risk/resiliency metrics significantly hinders, if not precludes, the use of such models. This difficulty becomes exasperated in risk-based decision-making where multiple building design solutions must be evaluated and compared over several hazards. The research goal of this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award is to overcome this fundamental limitation through the investigation of a new simulation paradigm based on the optimal fusion of low-/intermediate-fidelity metamodels with high-fidelity structural models. By defining the metamodels through domain independent approaches, multi-hazard assessment will be naturally encompassed and will enable new approaches for rapidly identifying the optimal tradeoff solutions to multi-hazard risk-based decision problems. These advances will provide models and procedures for enabling a full transition to optimal risk-based design, while promoting the rational use of computational resources through rigorous optimization. Risk-based design will benefit national welfare and prosperity through enhancing the safety of the built environment against wind and seismic events to better protect life and property during extreme events and to maintain essential services and business continuities during response and recovery. The educational goals of this CAREER award are to increase the number of women in engineering and professionals with expertise in wind loss mitigation. This will be achieved through a high school outreach program that leverages the link between risk-based engineering and societal benefit to inspire a diverse student pool to pursue careers in engineering, the development of an undergraduate wind engineering program at the University of Michigan, and undergraduate student research opportunities. To implement the high school outreach program, project-based learning modules that connect risk-based engineering and societal benefit through basic science will be created. Dissemination of these materials will be achieved through a teacher training workshop. Data from this project will be archived in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://DesignSafe-ci.org). <br/><br/>This research will create a new class of parametric metamodels (surrogate models) through identifying orthogonal subspaces for each high-fidelity computational model of the simulation environment. This will provide a setting in which both physics-based and data-driven reduced-order parametric metamodels can be defined through hyper-reduction and machine learning. The combined space of the high-fidelity and parametric metamodels will provide an enriched simulation environment in which multi-fidelity uncertainty propagation models can be defined for rapidly estimating high-fidelity probabilistic risk/resiliency metrics. The parametric nature of the metamodels will enable the creation of new adaptive multi-objective optimization schemes that will allow the rapid identification of high-fidelity multi-hazard Pareto fronts, which are central for effective risk-based decision-making. The models identified through this effort will directly benefit a number of other disciplines, including aerospace and biomedical engineering, atmospheric sciences, and the automotive industry, where rapid high-fidelity computation plays a key role in scientific discovery.

In order to understand how these genetic pathways function, one must identify and understand the patterns of DNA elements that ultimately control these genes. To address this fundamental scientific challenge in biological informatics, this project will use pattern recognition techniques in order to develop a detailed understanding of the way in which plant genes are controlled by DNA-encoded information. In order to do this, we will develop specific computational techniques for building and interpreting pattern recognition models. The most important aspect of this research is creating algorithms with the ability to recognize when a number of different DNA element patterns provide biologically relevant solutions for gene control. The algorithms, models, and biological outcomes developed by this project will be made available to the scientific community, including the plant science community. The underlying computational methods are expected to be applicable in many other fields of science and engineering. Teaching and training modules developed by this project will include outreach to our underserved communities of rural Oregon, including hands-on science experiences for high school students, as well as teacher training. The modules will draw special attention to the need for computationally trained researchers in the plant sciences, and to the need for a dramatically increased understanding of plant gene regulatory networks as a foundation for new drug discovery, agricultural, and materials biosynthesis challenges. <br/><br/>The combinatorial control of gene expression by Transcription Factors (TFs) is one of the most fundamental regulatory mechanisms across the eukaryotic tree of life, from plants to humans. The DNA region surrounding the start of a gene, called the promoter region, contains short regulatory sequence elements known as Transcription Factor Binding Sites (TFBSs). In plants, despite the many exciting potential advances that hinge on a detailed understanding of plant gene regulation, relatively little is known about the specific TFBS patterns that lead to gene expression. This project uses and extends a machine learning model developed by the Megraw lab that is able to predict the presence of Transcription Start Sites (TSSs) with high accuracy and resolution. A primary advantage of this model is that it suggests specific sets of TFBS:promoter interactions which have the potential to 'turn on' a particular gene. This model makes novel use of currently available high-throughput TSS data to examine the global structure of promoters in the model plant Arabidopsis, and in preliminary research suggests striking unanticipated differences between plant and animal DNA regulatory codes. The goal of this project is to rigorously test and expand this promising new computational approach for dissecting which TFBS sets are optimal predictors of gene up-regulation in a biological sample. The relative simplicity of the Arabidopsis genome makes this challenge tractable, yet capable of providing transformative insight into gene regulation in a multicellular organism.

It is daunting to identify a material that enables independent control of chemical composition, surface topography, mobility of functional groups, mechanical properties, and charge.  Polymer coatings comprising macromolecules linked at various locations via so-called crosslink points attached to surfaces may fit the bill.  A major obstacle that has hindered widespread application of such materials is the need for chemical synthesis of specialty polymers.  This project overcomes this limitation by turning a wide variety of polymers into surface-anchored crosslinked polymer coatings using a family of simple crosslinker molecules that are either commercially available or are very easy to synthesize.  Thus, anyone can utilize the proposed method in combination with a variety of starting materials to fabricate functional surfaces with controlled composition, softness, surface topography, and other important physico-chemical characteristics.  The processes leading to the formation of such surfaces have been designed to be highly scalable, so that they could be, in principle, applied to coat large-area surfaces.  This research project will also contribute to education of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in science and engineering.  These involve scientific training and communication, presentation skills, as well as ethical principles in science and technology.  Outreach activities in both local venues (high schools and colleges in the Research Triangle area) as well as at elementary school in Ararat, VA (located in one of the most rural areas of our country) will take place.  Local K-12 students and teachers will be encouraged to participate in the research/educational activities through individual mentoring and via programs organized by NC State's Science House.  Current efforts and future plans for organizing scientific and outreach meetings for academe, industry, and general public in the Research Triangle region are included.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The central goal of this project is to create functional surfaces by attaching polymer network films with highly tailorable characteristics onto solid substrates.  These polymer networks comprise arrays of long chain molecules (i.e., macromolecules) connected mutually at several nodes (i.e., crosslink points).  The polymer networks are generated by crosslinking macromolecules using small functional molecules (SFMs) equipped with two functional groups, A and B, wherein A forms a chemical bond with a neighboring polymer chain, and B groups from two neighboring SFMs (or/and the substrate) form either a chemical or a physical bond, depending on the nature of the B units.  This method makes any polymer, regardless of its functionality, amenable to chemical crosslinking and immobilization on surfaces.  Importantly, the SFMs are either available commercially or can be readily synthesized.  The immediate scientific and technological impact lies in providing a source-agnostic framework to design and produce surfaces with controlled chemical composition, tuned (and erasable) topology, tailorable softness and friction, and other relevant physico-chemical interfacial characteristics.  The simplicity and tunablity of the network-forming process makes it ideal for scientists and engineers without requiring high chemical expertise, and broadens its scope to biomedical and healthcare sciences, security, or national defense.  The project description outlines tasks that aim at testing the proposed hypothesis of network generation and establishing structure-process properties.  Specifically, the structure and kinetics of network formation will be established for a series of different SFMs, different annealing times, and annealing temperatures.  Functional polymer network coatings that alter mechanical properties of topography in response to external magnetic fields will be generated by incorporating magnetically-responsive nanoparticles into the SFMs.  The proposed effort also outlines new ways of forming bilayers featuring hydrogels (i.e., polymer networks that swell in water) and silicone elastomers (i.e., flexible rubbers that do not require solvent to remain flexible).  These laminates are frequently used in biomedical, shape-changing, and deformable materials, yet their preparation currently relies on harsh physical treatment of the elastomer component.  The proposed methodology removes this limitation and enables novel, cleaner, and reproducible manufacturing of these important composite materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nationally, there are many regions in which seismic hazards are especially uncertain because the return periods of earthquakes are longer than the historic record.  In other words, it is known that earthquakes have and will continue to occur, but because prior earthquakes predate human records and/or the advent of seismic instruments, the expected characteristics of future earthquakes are highly uncertain.  In these locales, soil liquefaction caused by past earthquakes, termed ""paleoliquefaction,"" may provide the only evidence from which information about the seismic-hazard can be determined, including earthquake magnitudes, locations, and recurrence-rates.  As a result, U.S. building codes are heavily influenced by paleoliquefaction evidence, and in turn, so too is public safety.  This award supports fundamental research to improve the analysis of paleoliquefaction, which at present suffers from limitations that can lead to highly erroneous results.  The findings will not only advance paleoliquefaction analytics, but will also benefit the understanding of liquefaction hazards in general, thus further reducing earthquake impacts on the built and natural environments.  In addition, an educational research component will investigate links between seismic risk perception and socio-psychological bias, leading to more effective educational platforms in natural hazards engineering. <br/><br/>This CAREER project aims to remove ubiquitous barriers to the accurate inverse-analysis of paleoliquefaction, which will be achieved by bridging fundamental knowledge-gaps at three distinct scales.  The research includes: (1) micro-scale physical-numerical investigation of the mechanics controlling the formation and morphology of fluidized dikes and sand boils; (2) meso-scale formulation of a coupled, mechanically-consistent liquefaction triggering and manifestation model; and (3) a macro-scale approach to probabilistically geolocate seismic sources from paleoliquefaction and assess their rupture magnitudes.  An analytical framework developed from the fundamental research will then be applied to paleoliquefaction evidence in regions where enigmatic seismic-hazards significantly impact society.  These include the Cascadia Subduction Zone of the Northwest U.S.; the New Madrid Seismic Zone of the Central U.S.; the South Carolina Coastal Plain of the Eastern U.S.; and Coastal New England in the Northeast U.S.  Aided by physical and numerical multi-scale modeling, field testing, and unprecedented case-history data, this research will advance both paleoliquefaction analytics and the understanding of liquefaction hazards in general, thus reducing future earthquake impacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it is challenging to provide effective personalized help, particularly online. Synchronous tools such as video chat enable interactive help but limit scheduling flexibility, which is a key advantage of online courses. Asynchronous tools such as discussion forums provide flexibility and allow students to learn from prior questions but are less interactive and lose important contextual information about the learner's question.  This project aims to design, build, and test ""semi-synchronous"" tools to combine the best of both help styles. The idea is that capturing snapshots of the program's code and output should allow learners to ask clearer questions and let instructors form a more complete picture of the problem that should improve their answers, while integrating chat features with the code and tracking how code changes as the discussion progresses should help other learners make more effective use of prior questions.  Building and testing these tools will advance knowledge about how to develop scalable collaborative systems, useful information repositories, and more effective support resources for programming courses.  Further, it will have practical impacts on software education, particularly for students with lower socioeconomic status who could benefit most from better support in online courses.<br/><br/>The project is organized around the evolution and evaluation of an existing prototype semi-synchronous tool called chat.codes.  On the development side, there are two major activities.  The first is integrating version tracking with the existing chat interface and developing tools to visualize how code changes along with conversational turns during a help session.  The second involves developing tools to archive, search, and view past conversations based on specific discussion topics, code keywords, or instructor-created tags.  The evaluation has four main phases.  The first is a one-hour lab study pairing students and instructors on simulated programming tasks that require students to learn a new concept from the instructor, aimed at evaluating the usability of chat.codes relative to other synchronous help systems.  The second is a lab study to test the archiving, search, and visualization features, assigning students to a programming problem and giving them access to the help sessions from the first experiment but not a live instructor to see how well the archived conversations both help solve the programming problems and convey the underlying concepts.  Results from both studies will be used to improve chat.codes, which will then be deployed as a remote support tool for two semesters in a large in-person introductory undergraduate programming course.  This deployment will be open-ended and students and instructors will not be required to use the tool but will be encouraged to do so; the project team will use a combination of interviews where they ask users to compare chat.codes to other support tools, along with analysis of logged help sessions, to better understand the strengths and weaknesses that come with integrating the code and chat elements.  The team will then develop a final version of the tool that will be deployed alongside existing online programming courses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Intelligence agencies analyze the interactions between terrorists to understand the structure of terrorist cells. However, there is a gap between the theory and practice of designing graph-learning algorithms. On the theory side, substantial progress has been made to design learning algorithms for stylized models, but the practical impacts are limited. On the practice side, efficient heuristics have been developed to analyze real-world graphs, but they often lack theoretical guarantees in terms of running time or accuracy. To bridge the theory-practice gap, this project will draw upon techniques from theoretical computer science, machine learning, and high-dimensional statistics to design theoretically sound, graph-learning algorithms that can (i) automatically choose the most suitable statistical network, (ii) leverage node-level information (e.g., users' profile in a social network), and (iii) properly handle the serial correlations in a graph. The algorithms will help practitioners to build more accurate network models at reduced cost, and have beneficial economic and social impacts on downstream applications.<br/><br/>From a technical standpoint, this research program will study the design of statistically sound, computationally tractable, and practically relevant algorithms for inferring latent structures in graphs. It consists of two thrusts: (i) Realistic interaction models. The project will use random graph theory and kernel learning to develop data-driven procedures to automatically select the most suitable assortative graph models, and introduces and analyzes a semi-adversarial model that can analyze more realistic interactions than those captured by real-valued weighted graphs; (ii) Time-evolving statistical models.

Acoustic wave guiding techniques are widely used in medical and engineering applications such as ultrasound, sound projection used in public announcement systems, underwater ecosystem monitoring, and several defense applications.  The state-of-the-art methods use fixed locations of acoustic transducers and digitally controlled signals to manage their wave guiding ability. These methods often tend to be inaccurate as they suffer from inherent ambiguity in locating virtual source or receiver. This limits their ability to do effective wave guiding.   This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will significantly enhance the state-of-the-art in wave guiding capability by innovative use of origami science. The research will investigate reconfigurable and adaptive origami-inspired acoustic transducers that can achieve simple yet highly effective wave guiding.  The portability of these origami-inspired transducer arrays will propel new applications in health care, ecosystem monitoring, and defense. This project will make new contributions to the knowledge base in acoustic wave guiding.  The project also has significant involvement of students at all levels from elementary to graduate. By harnessing the technical themes of folding origami structures in an integrated research-education program, this CAREER project will redress waning student exposures and interest in acoustics by a multi-faceted initiative that will introduce, immerse, and instill acoustic principles for student groups at many levels.<br/><br/>This CAREER project will establish analytical and computational tools to yield understanding on how origami-inspired, adaptive acoustic structures may transform wave guiding practices. The modeling framework will bridge acoustics, geometry, and mechanics via non-dimensional, spatial Fourier transforms to illuminate linear/nonlinear wave guiding phenomena and enable clear contrast with digital control methods and ideal acoustic radiators/receivers. The experimentally validated framework will reveal correlations among tessellation geometry, folding extent, and wavelength for scale-free wave guiding principles, while contrast between virtual and physical transducer positioning will expose origins of deficiencies in digital wave field control methods and guide attention to prime combinations of origami-inspired and digitally controlled wave guiding. A reversal of the framework will enable the design tessellated arrays for desired acoustic wave guiding properties, and will broadly advance multiphysics optimization of folding structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ferroelectrics comprise a class of crystalline materials that have found important technological applications in many types of devices, such as medical and underwater transducers, sensors, non-volatile memories, energy-efficient cooling. The goal of this research program is to understand the dynamic responses of inhomogeneous ferroelectric crystals under external ultrafast stimuli and in the presence of complex electrostatic and elastic interactions among domains within the crystal. The PI and his group will develop a dynamical phase-field method to model, predict, and understand the dynamical spatiotemporal evolution of polarization and strain domain patterns under ultrafast stimuli, taking into account long-range electrostatic and elastic interactions and domain-wall energy. The group will also explore novel transient or metastable domain states that may emerge when an inhomogeneous crystal relaxes from its externally stimulated excited state back to the original or a new equilibrium state; these could be hidden states that are normally not observable under thermodynamic conditions. The researchers will investigate ferroelectric and piezoelectric responses of inhomogeneous crystals under ultrafast external stimuli, and will explore thermal, electric, mechanical, and multifunctional responses at ultrafast frequencies. The group will utilize a network of experimental collaborators to validate the developed theory and computer codes against experiments.<br/><br/>The proposed dynamic phase-field method can be extended to the study of many other problems. For example, it can be adapted to solve a micromagnetic phase-field equation coupled with an elastodynamic equation for exploring ultrafast magnetization dynamics in ferromagnetic materials with strong magnetoelastic coupling. The proposed approach can also be extended to the study of electron-lattice coupling phenomena and the potential formation of novel electronic phases by introducing electronic degrees of freedom under ultrafast stimuli, allowing the manipulation of electronic phase transitions such as metal-insulator transitions in correlated systems.<br/><br/>The project is expected to have impact not only on materials science by advancing materials theories, but also on applied mathematics and the mechanics of materials. The PI will also integrate several educational and outreach activities into the research; these include: 1) the development of an open-source version of modeling software for ferroic materials and the organization of an associated annual workshop, 2) the recruitment of undergraduate students to perform research using the software package, and 3) the engagement of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM via participation in university-wide organized outreach activities and by recruiting them to perform research in the PI's laboratory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The scalability of MOF syntheses has always been a barrier to large scale industrial implementation, in which some frameworks either do not form at all or have diminished materials properties upon scaling. While the community has developed several methods for the synthesis of these materials, the fundamental chemistry behind their formation remains to be elucidated. This project focuses on understanding the mechanism of MOF formation at the early stages of their assembly, leading to advances in rational design, scalable synthesis, and increased industrial relevance. Through synergistically combining the synthesis of new materials and utilizing spectroscopy a detailed understanding of MOF formation is being developed. Such approaches have been the hallmark of other synthetic fields including the pharmaceutical industry in which a rich understanding of mechanistic organic chemistry has directly led to the synthesis of blockbuster drugs. To increase adult scientific literacy, a lecture series at the Mahoning Valley Lifelong Learning Institute (MVLLI), an adult-centered education facility, focusing on demystifying materials chemistry has been initiated. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The research activities focus on understanding the mechanism of formation of the inorganic secondary building units (SBUs) in metal-organic framework (MOF) architectures. This project outlines a spectroscopic and synthetic road map to gain mechanistic understanding of the formation of the SBU and the subsequent self-assembly process. This level of understanding is expected to lead to more efficient syntheses of MOFs and to novel framework architectures with untold properties that were previously inaccessible. Raman spectroscopy is used to identify solution-phase intermediates prior to the precipitation of the fully formed MOF (Objective 1). The identified intermediates are then targeted for independent synthesis in either molecular or polymeric form (Objective 2). The synthesized intermediates are subjected to further chemistry which yields electronically diverse copolymers that cannot be realized by traditional means (Objective 3). Undergraduate and Master level students are involved in all aspects of this project from MOF syntheses and spectroscopy to delivering lectures for the adult outreach program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Global bleaching events in 2015-17, severely impacting iconic coral reefs in places such as the Great Barrier Reef, Micronesia, Hawaiian Islands, and Caribbean, were the worst recorded in recent human history. When ocean temperatures rise, the symbiosis between reef-building corals and their photosynthetic algae deteriorates, many times resulting in widespread coral die-offs as corals can starve without their symbiotic partners to supply food. These widespread events can have drastic impacts on ocean health and biodiversity, as well as the communities that depend on reefs for fishing, tourism, and protection from storms. Importantly, some corals resist or recover from bleaching better than others. Such variability in coral response to ocean warming could be critical to reef survival in the future, yet the scientific community lacks any standardized diagnostics to rapidly assess bleaching tolerance limits. Here, we plan to: 1) develop a standardized, short-term exposure to assess bleaching limits (analogous to cardiac stress tests for humans), 2) design an experimental system capable of delivering a range of thermal treatments as an open-source, low-cost, highly-portable device that can be readily adapted for bleaching tests in a wide variety of coral habitats, and 3) disseminate the results, instructions, and technologies to the reef research and conservation community through a combination of hands-on workshops, online outreach materials, press releases, and open-access research publications. Widespread dissemination of project products will be achieved via hands-on demonstrations and workshops in key geographic areas (Middle East, Caribbean, and Indo-Pacific), with a focus on the assembly of the system and operation of the experimental assay using local corals. This project will train both graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, and brings together a team of national and global researchers in a collaborative investigation to address the international problem of coral bleaching.<br/><br/>With each passing year, coral bleaching has shifted from an issue of serious sporadic concern to a critical widespread threat to reefs across the globe that is increasing in frequency and severity. However, during widespread bleaching events, some scattered corals and reef sections are able to survive better than others. Whether this is due to acclimatization or adaptation in thermal stress tolerance, this variability in response is critical to coral resilience to climate impacts. Currently, the scientific community lacks a standardized approach to rapidly assess coral thermal limits and identify resilient individuals or populations. Present day approaches range from observational surveys of natural bleaching and mortality, to multiple weeks of controlled chronic thermal exposure, to rapid, single or multi-day acute heat shocks. To what degree bleaching response varies across short-term versus longer-term experiments and how these responses compare to natural bleaching patterns is largely unknown. Using a group of coral species representative of a historical range of bleaching susceptibility (e.g., Acropora hemprichii, Pocillopora meandrina, and Porites lobata), research will address this important knowledge gap by experimental evaluation of the bleaching response to acute (0 - 2 day) versus chronic (>4 week) thermal stress. The overarching questions for this study are: how are the acute and chronic coral bleaching responses related, and can investigators predict ecologically relevant bleaching outcomes from the response to a short-term, acute heat-stress? To answer these questions, the research team will: 1) objectively compare acute versus chronic heat-stress exposures and synthesize a variety of response metrics based on core physiological measurements to develop a standardized, short-term thermal assay and diagnostic approach to rapidly assess bleaching, 2) operationalize an experimental system built around an open-source, cost-effective, easily transportable temperature control technology, and 3) distribute the results, experimental procedures, and temperature controlling technologies to the reef research and conservation communities. This project will produce an affordable experimental system and short-term diagnostic capable of determining coral thermal limits in just a few days in almost any location with reliable access to seawater and electricity or a portable generator. The research fills a critical knowledge gap through the development of a standardized set of diagnostic tools to assess coral thermal vulnerability before widespread bleaching events actually occur, so that proactive conservation and management strategies can be implemented ahead of widespread impacts to reef ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The resulting designs are highly optimized for their application, enabling lightweight high-performance structures. However, the designs tend to have an intricate organic-looking structure making them challenging to manufacture reliably and economically. Prior attempts to impose manufacturing constraints during the topology optimization process have had limited success. Furthermore, current methods cannot directly consider manufacturing costs, making it difficult for designers to factor in economic objectives or constraints. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to formulate the first framework to systematically incorporate geometric design rules and manufacturing cost in topology optimization, and to integrate this framework with educational activities that improve the attitudes of underrepresented minorities towards STEM fields. This research will enable the conceptual design and optimization of lightweight, high-performance, and economically-viable structures with applications across a wide range of engineering industries. The new design capabilities will have the potential to significantly reduce manufacturing and R&D costs and thereby increase the economic competitiveness of American manufacturers. This award will also positively impact underrepresented minorities through an integrated education plan aimed at increasing student self-efficacy and stimulating their participation in STEM. The educational program includes an engaging, virtual-reality based after-school program for middle school students. This program will also engage and impact K-12 teachers and undergraduate and graduate students, and it will be a conduit to communicate research outcomes to the wider public and the research community.<br/><br/>Although topology optimization is a successful technique for structural design, its impact is limited by challenges in incorporating manufacturing constrains and economic considerations into the optimization process. These gaps are rooted in the difficulty to express many manufacturing-driven geometric requirements in terms of the design representations used by existing techniques, the discrete nature of some geometric features, and the fact that manufacturing cost can be a non-smooth function of the design. This CAREER project will make three major intellectual contributions to the computational design of structures, namely the coupling of feature-based design representations with 1) global optimization methods to escape entrapment in undesired local minima in the presence of many geometric design rules; 2) discrete optimization methods to accommodate discrete geometric features; and 3) parametric cost models and non-smooth optimization methods to incorporate cost in the topology optimization problem. The new techniques will be validated against benchmarks and demonstrated on engineering problems in collaboration with industry partners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To analyze and eventually design structural systems requires potent mathematical tools to account for complex response behaviors as well as for the presence of uncertainties in the modeling process. The current state-of-the-art analysis techniques exhibit either high accuracy or computational efficiency but not both. This is inadequate for proper system analysis, design and optimization. The unique feature of the approach, that exhibits both considerable accuracy and computational efficiency, will push the current capabilities of stochastic analysis to unprecedented levels. This will lead to a paradigm shift in the optimization and design of higher quality diverse engineering systems ranging from nano-mechanical oscillators, to vibratory energy harvesters and civil infrastructure systems at reduced cost. The results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society in general.  The diverse education and outreach plan will also impact the advancement of next-generation researchers and practicing engineers, as well as students and educators via the teaching and learning innovations. <br/><br/>Available techniques for solving the governing equations and determining the stochastic response of dynamical systems can be broadly divided into two categories: a) those that exhibit high accuracy, but can handle a very small number of stochastic dimensions due to prohibitive computational cost, and b) those that can readily treat high-dimensional systems, but provide reliable estimates for low-order response statistics only (e.g. mean and standard deviation). In comparison to the current state-of-the-art techniques, the path integral methodology will exhibit superior accuracy and computational efficiency. To achieve high accuracy the research approach is to account for higher order terms (fluctuations) in related path integral expansions. At the same time the error of the methodology will be quantified. To achieve high computational efficiency and account for a large number of stochastic dimensions (>100), the research approach is to explore highly sparse representations for the system response in conjunction with appropriate optimization algorithms. The methodology will also be versatile, accounting for cases of complex stochastic excitation and system modeling including fractional derivatives, and non-Gaussian, nonlinear, and hysteretic response behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Accumulating evidence suggests that cancer cells can reside in vital organs (e.g., brain) in a sleep mode (dormant) for extended periods of time and could reawaken at a later stage resulting in disease relapse and often death. However, the mechanisms by which metastatic breast cancer cells in the brain stay dormant and later become activated are not well understood, making it difficult to develop new therapeutic strategies. A few experimental models have been devised for studying dormancy in metastatic breast cancer cells; however, experimental model systems to study dormancy in brain metastatic breast cancer cells outside of a living organism (in vitro) are not available. This project focuses on developing an engineered biomimetic three dimensional in vitro experimental model of dormancy to study how biophysical, biochemical, and cellular signals of the brain tissue microenvironment regulate dormancy in brain metastatic breast cancer cells and define the associated molecular mechanisms.  The technologies developed and insights gained could be broadly applied to fundamental investigations of neural development, tissue regeneration, and stem cell engineering as stem cells typically stay in a dormant state until activated to promote tissue repair, and could be used to study dormancy in other types of brain metastatic cancers. The education and outreach plans are well integrated with research and include: providing educational sessions in high schools and in a ""Scientist for a Day"" program, initiating a four-day mentored research experience for students and teachers from Alabama's economically challenged Black Belt region, providing research experiences for undergraduate students and enhancing undergraduate and graduate education by developing a course in cancer bioengineering and tailoring existing coursework to incorporate problems with biological relevance.  These activities are designed with the goal of motivating pursuit of STEM careers for students from socially and economically challenged backgrounds, women, and minority students.<br/><br/>The project focuses on developing an in vitro model to test the hypothesis that biophysical, biochemical and cellular cues in the brain microenvironment regulate the dormancy of breast cancer cells that have metastasized to the brain. Three dimensional (3D) tissue-mimetic hydrogel scaffolds using hyaluronic acid will be engineered to replicate biochemical composition, mechanics and cellular components of the brain.  The scaffolds created will provide controllable systems to investigate microenvironment-tumor cell interactions, to study the mechanisms controlling dormancy and to test if the dormant phenotype observed in BCBM cells is reversible by modulating the scaffold environment. The Research Plan is organized under 4 specific aims: 1) Investigate the influence of mechanical cues (stiffness and mechanotransduction pathways) in regulating tumor dormancy in vitro; 2) Investigate the influence of biochemical cues (biomolecules found in the brain tumor extracellular matrix) in regulating tumor dormancy in vitro; 3) Investigate the influence of cellular cues (astrocytes) in regulating tumor dormancy in vitro and 4) Examine known signaling pathways (e.g., p38 and TGF-Beta) regulating dormancy in the biomimetic environment in vitro and identify additional pathways using a systems biology approach (proteomics and genomics), i.e., to elucidate the mechanisms governing dormancy in the engineered biomimetic scaffold, linking microenvironmental factors to the ultimate cellular phenotype: ""dormant"" or ""proliferative.""<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A shortage of qualified L/SC technicians has resulted in a growing workforce gap of six available jobs for every currently employed skilled worker. Industry officials have linked the workforce shortage to five key factors: increasing demand for new L/SC talent, L/SC talent gaps, changing dynamics of supply chains, limited capacity to educate and train new talent, and the poor image of the profession with the millennial workforce. To meet industry needs, community colleges must work collaboratively with industry partners to revise current L/SC programs or develop new programs that prepare the next generation of L/SC professionals. This project at Palo Alto College (San Antonio, Texas) aims to better serve the specific L/SC workforce education needs of regional businesses and industries.  The program aims to: increase the science, technology, engineering and mathematics content and technical training in its L/SC programs; increase L/SC student enrollment; improve L/SC student technical skills and STEM knowledge; and improve L/SC educational and workforce pipelines. The project will combine an L/SC industry workforce assessment with research on the career expectations of millennial students. By appealing to the millennials' interest in new technologies and leveraging the evolving technological landscape of supply chains, the project has the potential to change the perception of L/SC careers among millennial students.  As a result, a new generation of workers can be recruited into an industry with national and global importance. Because Palo Alto College is a Hispanic Serving Institution and the dual credit partner school districts have a majority Hispanic student population, an additional outcome of this project is the potential to diversify the L/SC industry.  It also will serve a student group that is typically underrepresented in STEM education and training. The program will include hands-on technology-based lesson modules, mini-case competitions, recruitment efforts, industry internships, and development of an active student organization.  <br/><br/>The overall objective of the project is to create a high school to two-year to four-year L/SC educational pipeline, while incorporating robotics and other emerging supply chain technologies into the program curriculum. The project aims to educate and train more qualified (L/SC) technicians to meet workforce needs by: (1) conducting an industry review of the college Logistics associate degree and certificates, (2) creating four L/SC emerging technology course modules; (3) establishing a dual credit programs with three high schools (Southside, Southwest Legacy, and Veterans Memorial) where students can earn an L/SC associate degree; (4) conducting targeted recruitment activities to educate students about L/SC careers; (5) creating a Discover Logistics training module for secondary school educators; and (6) establishing a transfer agreement between Palo Alto College and the Texas A&M San Antonio (TAMUSA) four-year L/SC program. The project also plans to create and host an annual L/SC mini-case competition for partner high schools. STEM-based recruitment activities will strive to serve more than 1,000 high school students, while the dual credit program and course modules will aim to serve an estimated 150 high school students and 100 L/SC college students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Historical observations show that La Niña events can last two years or longer, a feature that could make their associated drought impacts more persistent. Forecast systems are generally able to predict the onset of La Niña, as they virtually always follow El Niño. However, little is known about the predictability of multi-year La Niña events because current operational ENSO forecasts are limited to 8 months. This project addresses a series of questions that are critical to improve our ability to predict these events. The project will determine the processes, initial ocean states, and models that can produce skillful multi-year predictions of tropical Pacific. Predicting whether La Niña will return for a second year is critical for predicting the duration of associated droughts throughout the world. Results from this project can potentially improve our ability to predict both the strength and duration of US droughts caused by La Niña.<br/><br/>Observations show that La Niña events tend to last for an additional year, causing persistent drought and flooding impacts in regions throughout the world. Forecasts of these 2-year La Niña events are not routinely generated by operational prediction systems because they focus on shorter lead times, typically up to eight months. This project will demonstrate the feasibility of skillful predictions of 2-year La Niña. Multi-year forecasts will be performed using the Community Earth System Model Version 1 (CESM1), a model that simulates realistic and highly predictable 2-year La Niña. Model dependence of 2-year predictability will be explored using decadal climate predictions performed by four climate models that participated in Phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). These retrospective forecasts (hindcasts) performed with CESM1 and CMIP5 will be used to explore the physical processes responsible for the predictability of historical 2-year La Niña. Advanced diagnostics will be used to attribute the processes causing forecast spread. Discrepancies in the hindcasts of historical 2-year La Niña events relative to their observed trajectory will be analyzed to identify their predictable and unpredictable drivers. An existing suite of seasonal predictions performed with CESM1 will be extended to produce 2-year hindcasts initialized in March, June, and September. Together with the existing suite of decadal predictions initialized in November, the proposed extension will be used to explore the impact of different lead times, initial state, and seasonality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Global bleaching events in 2015-17, severely impacting iconic coral reefs in places such as the Great Barrier Reef, Micronesia, Hawaiian Islands, and Caribbean, were the worst recorded in recent human history. When ocean temperatures rise, the symbiosis between reef-building corals and their photosynthetic algae deteriorates, many times resulting in widespread coral die-offs as corals can starve without their symbiotic partners to supply food. These widespread events can have drastic impacts on ocean health and biodiversity, as well as the communities that depend on reefs for fishing, tourism, and protection from storms. Importantly, some corals resist or recover from bleaching better than others. Such variability in coral response to ocean warming could be critical to reef survival in the future, yet the scientific community lacks any standardized diagnostics to rapidly assess bleaching tolerance limits. Here, we plan to: 1) develop a standardized, short-term exposure to assess bleaching limits (analogous to cardiac stress tests for humans), 2) design an experimental system capable of delivering a range of thermal treatments as an open-source, low-cost, highly-portable device that can be readily adapted for bleaching tests in a wide variety of coral habitats, and 3) disseminate the results, instructions, and technologies to the reef research and conservation community through a combination of hands-on workshops, online outreach materials, press releases, and open-access research publications. Widespread dissemination of project products will be achieved via hands-on demonstrations and workshops in key geographic areas (Middle East, Caribbean, and Indo-Pacific), with a focus on the assembly of the system and operation of the experimental assay using local corals. This project will train both graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher, and brings together a team of national and global researchers in a collaborative investigation to address the international problem of coral bleaching.<br/><br/>With each passing year, coral bleaching has shifted from an issue of serious sporadic concern to a critical widespread threat to reefs across the globe that is increasing in frequency and severity. However, during widespread bleaching events, some scattered corals and reef sections are able to survive better than others. Whether this is due to acclimatization or adaptation in thermal stress tolerance, this variability in response is critical to coral resilience to climate impacts. Currently, the scientific community lacks a standardized approach to rapidly assess coral thermal limits and identify resilient individuals or populations. Present day approaches range from observational surveys of natural bleaching and mortality, to multiple weeks of controlled chronic thermal exposure, to rapid, single or multi-day acute heat shocks. To what degree bleaching response varies across short-term versus longer-term experiments and how these responses compare to natural bleaching patterns is largely unknown. Using a group of coral species representative of a historical range of bleaching susceptibility (e.g., Acropora hemprichii, Pocillopora meandrina, and Porites lobata), research will address this important knowledge gap by experimental evaluation of the bleaching response to acute (0 - 2 day) versus chronic (>4 week) thermal stress. The overarching questions for this study are: how are the acute and chronic coral bleaching responses related, and can investigators predict ecologically relevant bleaching outcomes from the response to a short-term, acute heat-stress? To answer these questions, the research team will: 1) objectively compare acute versus chronic heat-stress exposures and synthesize a variety of response metrics based on core physiological measurements to develop a standardized, short-term thermal assay and diagnostic approach to rapidly assess bleaching, 2) operationalize an experimental system built around an open-source, cost-effective, easily transportable temperature control technology, and 3) distribute the results, experimental procedures, and temperature controlling technologies to the reef research and conservation communities. This project will produce an affordable experimental system and short-term diagnostic capable of determining coral thermal limits in just a few days in almost any location with reliable access to seawater and electricity or a portable generator. The research fills a critical knowledge gap through the development of a standardized set of diagnostic tools to assess coral thermal vulnerability before widespread bleaching events actually occur, so that proactive conservation and management strategies can be implemented ahead of widespread impacts to reef ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is estimated that 70% to 80% percent of the time devoted on analytics projects is spent on checking and organizing data. The challenge is that data collection often introduces incomplete, erroneous, replicated, or conflicting data records. The burden of data preparation has led to many efforts in automating isolated tasks related to data cleaning, such as record de-duplication. However, success with end-to-end data cleaning has been limited, especially in the presence of critical data driven applications.

For example, the enhancement of turbulent mixing associated with breaking internal waves over topography has been suggested to play a central role in closing the deep branch of the meridional overturning circulation. Likewise, turbulent mixing in the BBL can result when large-scale currents flowing along sloping topography are decelerated by bottom friction. Importantly, these processes generate temperature and salinity fields in the BBL that are well mixed in the vertical but not in the horizontal, similar to fronts near the sea surface. This similarity suggests that many types of submesoscale (horizontal scales of 0.1 - 10 kilometers) instabilities, which to-date have been studied almost exclusively in the context of upper-ocean fronts, may also be active in the BBL. In the surface ocean, submesoscale processes are known to play an important role in restratifying the surface mixed layer, thereby counteracting turbulent mixing, and in the dispersal and transport of tracers such as pollutants, dissolved gases, and nutrients. Understanding the conditions under which submesoscale processes may be active in the BBL, as well as their effect on the circulation and mixing, therefore has potentially far-reaching implications for understanding the physics and biogeochemical properties of both deep and coastal oceans. This project will support a promising early career scientist who conceived and wrote the bulk of this proposal and new scientific results will be incorporated into outreach lectures and laboratory demonstrations for local high-school students.<br/><br/>This project will use a combination of theory and idealized numerical modeling to study the dynamics of submesoscale instabilities in the BBL generated during the frictional spin-down of a current on a slope. Preliminary calculations suggest that BBLs over sloping topography can support a submesoscale baroclinic instability mode, a BBL counterpart to surface mixed-layer instabilities. These instabilities are fast-growing, and relatively insensitive to the topographic slope, suggesting they may be a common feature of the ocean BBL. Initial numerical simulations also suggest that these baroclinic instabilities can lead to vertical buoyancy fluxes which, under some conditions, may dominate other more widely-studied sources of vertical buoyancy fluxes, such as the breaking of internal waves at topography. The proposed research will expand upon these initial results, using linear stability analysis and idealized numerical modeling, to provide a complete exploration of the parameter dependence of BBL submesoscale instabilities, with a focus on turbulent fluxes of buoyancy and potential vorticity. Boundary layer dynamics for flow over idealized variations in topography, including channel flows, will also be considered.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports research and education towards the acceleration of progress in our understanding of complex materials, which manifest prominent competition between quantum effects such as magnetism, superconductivity, and strongly correlated electron behavior.<br/><br/>In simpler materials, for which model representations in terms of a system of independent particles suffices, advanced methods have enabled large-scale simulations of the physical properties of realistic systems. For materials exhibiting correlated electron behavior, where the behavior of one electron is strongly dependent on that of other electrons in the material, the Dynamical Mean Field Theory method has enabled practical and accurate calculations of basic material properties. This project focuses on the development of software that simulates such complex materials with a computer, and which can predict material properties. The focus is in improving the precision of the theory, and in developing new theoretical spectroscopy tools, which will enable the prediction of the precise crystal structures of correlated solids, and the prediction of actual spectroscopic measurements made using neutron and x-ray scattering experimental techniques.<br/><br/>The project will lead to the development of algorithms and software that will be incorporated in open-source code packages, which subsequently will be made available to the wider research community.

This award supports research and education towards the development of a number of theoretical spectroscopic tools, which can be used in combination with electronic structure tools. The latter are based on Dynamical Mean Field Theory (developed under previous NSF support), and enable theoretical prediction of material properties using first-principles methods. The spectroscopic tools and methods that will be developed in this project include: i) relaxation of complex crystal structures using forces on all atoms in the unit cell, which will enable prediction of complex crystal structures; ii) extension of the calculation of forces to materials with large spin-orbit coupling; iii) developing a tool to predict phase transitions in systems with strongly coupled crystal- and electronic structure; iv) developing a tool to calculate phonons in correlated materials; v) developing x-ray scattering spectroscopy that properly takes into account the core-hole interaction.<br/><br/>These tools will be made available to the broader scientific community as they will be incorporated in the PI's electronic structure software package, which is widely used, and is distributed as open-source; see: http://hauleweb.rutgers.edu/tutorials/.

Neurodegenerative disease, resulting from the progressive loss of neurons, takes a devastating toll on the aging population in the U.S. Recent advances in magnetically driven biodegradable ultra-small nanoparticles offer opportunities in transformational non-invasive neuron regeneration treatments. This innovative technology holds great potential to usher biotechnology into a new era of precision medicine and tissue engineering. However, to date, neuroscientists have largely focused on the associated biological phenomena, with little attention to microvascular dynamics of nanoparticle transport, thus limiting the translation to clinical practice. The microvascular dynamic model, established from this research will be capable of quantifying the neuron regeneration process. This is essential for overcoming intrinsic trial-and-error approaches and for moving closer to clinical success. Additionally, the education and outreach activities  of the project will advance awareness of nanotechnology and biomedicine, and will increase the participation of historically underrepresented groups in STEM, including women, and first-generation college students in the greater Long Island. <br/><br/>The research objective of this CAREER project is to employ analytical perturbative and continuation approaches to analyze biological phenomena to yield a rich harvest of predictive insights into the microvascular dynamics of ultra-small nanoparticles transport in a brain microenvironment. The research plan is to first create two dynamic models: one will capture the magnetic transport behavior of ultra-small nanoparticles within a microvasculature; the other will describe cytoskeleton dynamics within brain microvascular networks. Combined, a microvascular dynamic model of nanoparticle transport will be established to discern which parameters are needed for directing target-selective magnetic stimulation to produce a reliable and steady therapeutic tool by applying a pre-defined magnetic field on the nanoparticles. For the first time, cytoskeleton dynamics associated with growing neurons will be analyticaly modeled by perturbing a nanoparticle diffusing in a potential well with a slowly drifting minimum position. Importantly, this model will be constructed to track the individual growing behaviors of thousands of neurons, and perform high-throughput/low-cost sensitivity analyses to identify the key parameters in a complex brain microenvironment. Furthermore, combined with recent advances in power electronics, this project holds a high potential for contributing to the development of a new microchip that improves researcher capacity for studying the growth behavior of the neuron cells inside a three dimensional extracellular matrix.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will advance the science of automated computational design by creating new algorithms capable of generating and optimizing multi-body systems.  Starting with only a mathematical description of design materials and physical environment, the algorithms will automatically generate assemblies for compound machines that combine multiple basic components such as levers, hinges, wheels, and axles, which together form the foundation of all mechanical design. This work will enable a new level of automated computational design not previously possible under existing design frameworks.  The knowledge obtained from this research will benefit a wide range of applications including nanoscale mechanisms for delivery of medications and self-reproducing robotic systems. The project also involves an integrated education program featuring a STEM Pipeline program for undergraduate students from underrepresented minority groups. The program includes bi-weekly labs and seminars, team design projects, and K-12 outreach activities. <br/><br/>The algorithms created in this project will rely upon several novel design formulations devised specifically for the design task.  Chief among these will be an original topology optimization-type framework in which the internal topologies of multiple planar design domains are optimized simultaneously, while also optimizing the connectivity between adjacent domains to form compound mechanisms whose components can slide and rotate freely with respect to one another.  The mechanical behavior of the designs will be modeled using a combination of finite element analysis and flexible multibody dynamics to capture the rigid body motion and the elastic deflection of the system components.

Smoke from these fires exposes millions of individuals to unhealthy air quality each year. In spite of this, fire is an essential component of many natural ecosystems where fire suppression has proven to be an unsustainable practice that harms the natural balance. The PI will develop computational tools and innovative assessments to help US land managers lessen the impact to human health of air pollution from smoke, while at the same time restoring the natural fire cycle to improve ecosystem health. Concurrent with this applied research initiative will be an educational program to train specialized environmental engineers and inform different segments of the US public about the benefits and challenges associated with wildland fire. <br/><br/>Wildland managers routinely manipulate fire, through prescribed burns and mechanical land treatments, to reduce the risk of hazardous wildfire and achieve important ecological objectives; however, these fire projects often fail to quantitatively account for the health impacts of smoke exposure. In contrast, air quality regulations seek to mitigate the negative effects of air pollution on public health but can overlook the value of active land management. Through computational modeling, environmental engineering education, and outreach the PI aims to align these air quality and land management objectives. To pursue this aim, the project includes the following goals: 1) enable fire management based on potential health impacts; 2) incorporate air pollution externalities into prescribed fire planning; 3) develop integrated land management and air quality scenarios; and 4) change perceptions of fire and smoke through environmental engineering education.  New modeling tools that encompass aspects from emissions to air pollution exposure will facilitate fire project management while minimizing potential health impacts. High-performance computing and ensemble modeling will be used to generate geographic assessments of the public health externalities of prescribed fire, facilitating their inclusion in regional wildland fire planning. The PI will also develop integrated land management and air quality scenarios that jointly consider wildfire risk, land treatments, air quality, and public health impacts. These scenarios will provide a basis for comprehensive integrated assessment modeling of wildland fire beyond smoke impacts. The PI will seek to change misguided perceptions of fire and smoke among scientific and broader communities by establishing an educational partnership with the North Carolina State Division of Parks and Recreation centered on wildland fire and smoke. A key outcome of this work will be the formation of graduate and undergraduate environmental engineers trained in simulation of complex environmental systems and effective science communication.

Composite materials are made by combining two or more materials, the combination of which provides enhanced electrical, mechanical, chemical, and/or surface properties. Understanding how to control the processing of composite materials enables customized performance for a broad range of critical applications. There are many manufacturing processes to make composite materials. However, most require multiple process steps and require the use of significant energy and chemicals, both of which are costly and wasteful. This grant supports fundamental research to provide new knowledge about a novel light irradiation process that will enable rapid, scalable, and controllable manufacturing of composite materials made from polymers and ceramics with lower cost and energy usage. This multidisciplinary research integrates manufacturing, chemistry, and materials science and will help broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>The light-induced self-writing of composite material architectures can overcome several limitations of existing manufacturing techniques, such as high cost, high energy usage, multiple steps, and lack of microscale control over morphology.

This research aims to fill the knowledge gap on the processing-structure-property relationship and the microstructure formation mechanisms for self-writing polymer-inorganic composite material architectures. Experiments will be performed to establish relationships between process parameters and composite morphology to test the hypothesis that self-writing can regulate morphology evolution in terms of reaction and diffusion kinetics.

This type of instruction provides students with opportunities to reason deeply about core subject matter ideas, take part in the discourses of the discipline, and solve authentic problems. It is designed to engage all students, regardless of gender, socioeconomic status, or cultural background, and to enable all students to learn science and math. This project proposes to: (a) test tools, routines, and materials designed to develop pre-service teachers' knowledge of their students; (b) identify instructional practices appropriate for novice teachers at different points on their learning trajectories; (c) support cooperating teachers in their roles as mentors; and (d) investigate the links between agency and novice learning.  In this context, agency is the capacity to seek out diverse opportunities to learn and to advocate for opportunities to plan, teach, and engage with students. The project will develop ?opportunities-to-learn resources? and associated case studies.  These materials have the potential to help other teacher education programs improve the impact of preservice teachers? clinical experiences, resulting in more teachers who are prepared for their own classrooms, especially when serving racially, ethnically, and linguistically diverse students. Cooperating teachers (veteran teachers) may benefit from other project resources that will be designed to guide collaboration. These materials will also include guides for complex instruction and students' intellectual engagement. Adoption of these opportunities-to-learn materials by teacher education programs, novice teachers, and mentor teachers in host schools could create a common language and understanding of research-based clinical practices, which could inform more effective teacher field placements. <br/><br/>This work builds on a previously-funded Noyce Research project that documented how the clinical experience of 68 pre-service teachers shaped their eventual practice, and by extension, chances for their future students to learn. Based on these data, this project intends to: a) strengthen the framework about systems of support for novice learning during clinical experiences by combining findings from the previous and the current study: b) develop a system of tools, routines, and resources that teacher education programs and their school partners can use to enhance pre-service teachers' opportunities-to-learn about ?ambitious instruction? over the course of their field placement; and c) test the implementation and effect of the opportunities-to-learn materials that the project will develop. More than 60 pre-service secondary science and mathematics teachers, and their cooperating teachers, will participate in the project.  The three teacher education programs involved in this research study recruit from diverse demographics and send their novices to varied communities, mostly underserved urban, sub-urban, and rural. This participation should allow the project to improve materials and implementation procedures for their specific context, and to disaggregate the findings according to different groups of pre-service teachers and the communities served by their placement schools. Data analysis should increase the functionality of the project's theory of action and the system of supports across settings. Survey and interview data will be collected to test if the system of resources influences the frequency, variability, and quality of pre-service teachers' opportunities-to-learn. The project will examine the novice teachers' adherence to a productive trajectory of such opportunities over the course of their clinical experience.  Study findings will contribute to understanding how pre-service teachers learn under supportive conditions, as well as assist the project in refining resources and programmatic experiences to optimize the potential success of pre-service teachers as professional educators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Software developers of platforms of all kinds are creating features that make use of algorithmically curated content that leverage data about people's relationships, behavior, and identities. However, algorithms usually make decisions based on system metrics that are readily calculable, such as the number of likes, plays, and clicks. Even more sophisticated algorithms are limited by the social information explicitly given or inferred from provided data. As a result, algorithms can fail to capture the social context and human meaning that is important to the acceptability and success of the interactions these algorithms are meant to support.

By attending to divergence, the research can examine human expectations of algorithms, how misunderstandings might be reframed, and how subsequent action is informed by those divergences. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project will identify (1) how people navigate sensitive algorithmic encounters; (2) how these encounters impact people; (3) what social concepts algorithms are failing to understand; and (4) what design strategies are needed to address sensitive content in algorithmic curation.

Soft robots are intelligent machines with a highly compliant physical structure -- that is, the body of the soft robot will bend when relatively small forces are applied to it. High compliance makes soft robots much safer around people than traditional rigid robots, and also allows soft robots to attain a variety of shapes and to move in many more ways than robots with only a small number of discrete joints. Because structures that are easy to bend cannot carry large loads, a major challenge in soft robotics is to create variable-stiffness structures that are compliant only in certain directions, or only at specific times. This project presents a new approach to engineering variable-stiffness soft robots, inspired by the art and science of ""origami,"" or paper folding. Origami-inspired soft robots use thin sheets of relatively stiff materials that are made bendable along designated fold lines; the folding pattern can be used to create very precise and complex equivalent mechanical properties. This engineered flexibility contrasts with soft robot structures made of materials such as rubbers and foams, which are limited in their achievable strength by the intrinsic softness of the material itself. In this project, origami-inspired folding patterns are used to create modules with a specified compliant behavior. Larger and more capable robots can then be built up by combining many such modules. Examples of the potential of modular origami-inspired robots include soft tentacle-like manipulation in confined spaces, whole-body and passive conformal grasping, and controllable shape change. The results of the project will advance the national health and prosperity, by enabling origami-inspired soft robots to be used in homes, hospitals, and manufacturing sites, as care-givers, co-workers, and self-morphing structures. Educational activities integrated with this project will use origami-inspired robots as teaching tools for students of all ages through outreach activities, high-school internships, and undergraduate projects. <br/><br/>This project will establish modular and scalable design and fabrication methods, characterize and model mechanical properties, and test control algorithms for lightweight origami-inspired modular continuum soft robots to intelligently perform manipulation, grasping, and shape-change tasks.

Organic crystals composed of light-sensitive molecules can undergo a variety of light-induced shape changes such as bending, twisting, and coiling.  These materials could have application across a broad range of fields spanning from engineering to medicine to cell biology, by making it possible to create microdevices powered by light.  One example of such a device would be a light-powered swimmer for microsurgery or drug delivery.  The application of these photomechanical materials is hampered by a limited understanding of how they work and how their performance can be optimized.  The PI will address these challenges by controlling important parameters like molecular structure and crystal shape, while designing new optical experiments to examine how the light-induced changes occur inside the crystals.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The creation of stable photoreactive molecules is a prerequisite for better performing materials.  One phase of the research concentrates on making new molecules to make crystalline structures that can survive exposure to air and solvents.  For example, the use of fluorine substitution will raise the molecular oxidation potential and may also enhance crystal plasticity.  Molecular crystals can also exhibit nonlinear spatio-temporal reaction kinetics that can lead to autocatalysis, enhanced mechanical response, and oscillatory motion under steady-state illumination.  Oscillatory motion can potentially be harnessed to provide locomotion for micro-swimmers.  Along with new theoretical approaches, a novel standing-wave fluorescence experiment will be developed to directly probe the nonlinear reaction kinetics in single crystals.  Finally, both bottom-up solution growth and top-down laser cutting will be used to create crystals with well-defined orientations and shapes.  By controlling both crystal shape and the orientation of the strain tensor with respect to that shape, a detailed investigation into how both variables determine the crystal's response to light will become possible.  The broader impacts of this work include potential societal impacts resulting from new materials that transform photons into mechanical motion and enable new devices.  Participating graduate and undergraduate students will receive training in spectroscopy, materials characterization, and data analysis that will enable them to contribute in economically important areas like photonics.

For example, El Niños cause droughts in Australia and Southeast Asia while producing damaging floods along the west coast of the United States, Ecuador and Peru. La Niñas produce the opposite effects and both can have significant economic and natural hazard impacts. Recent studies have identified more than one type of ENSO event in the instrumental record, called Central Pacific, Eastern Pacific, or Coastal El Niño events based on the region with greatest rainfall. These different types of El Niños may explain why ENSO reconstructions from the western, central, and eastern Pacific do not always agree. Furthermore, questions remain whether or not this diversity of ENSO events occurred before the 20th century when temperatures were cooler, or occurred during prior warm periods. This project seeks to fill a gap in our knowledge of past ENSO behavior by providing a new record of ENSO variability in north-central Peru for the period 2800 to 2100 years ago, a critical area and time frame currently lacking records of ENSO variability. Our understanding of past and present ENSO is important for refining global climate models used to forecast future climate conditions and in planning for short and long-term impacts from changing climate.<br/><br/>This project leverages the expertise of paleoclimatologists and archaeologists while training students in a multidisciplinary approach that will develop a new reconstruction method that could be used in other locations with abundant shell material. The final product will be a new record of ENSO variability in north-central Peru spanning 2800 to 2100 years before present. The study sites are three Early Horizon (800 to 100 BCE) archaeological sites (Caylán, Huambacho, and Samanco), all part of an early urban society in the coastal Nepeña Valley, Peru. The project uses shells from two short-lived bivalve species (Donax obesulus and Mesodesma donacium) excavated from several archaeological units within these three sites. These two species have different but complementary habitat preferences (warm vs. cold) that make them useful to capture El Niño and La Niña events; however, both species are short-lived (1 to 3 years). Instead of building a continuous record of individual ENSO events, this project will reconstruct seasonal temperature and salinity variability from modern and archaeological specimens for individual time slices from intra-shell oxygen isotope measurements, similar to the single foraminifer approach used in marine sediment cores. The integration of archaeological data will provide a crucial perspective on the resilience or vulnerability of coastal societies to ENSO variability on long time periods. The project will support two relatively early career faculty (one female), a graduate student, and one or more undergraduates who will work in the PIs' PAST laboratory (Paleoclimate and Anthropology Studies), which brings natural and social scientists together to foster interdisciplinary collaboration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This general pattern has been known since the 1920s but the role of the clouds in cyclone evolution, and the effects of the cloud pattern on atmospheric circulation and climate, are still under study. The topic is of practical as well as scientific interest as clouds can only be represented in approximate form in current weather and climate models, and cloud errors limit the quality of simulations and forecasts. Results of the work have direct bearing on the quality of weather forecasts and climate projections used to provide guidance to decision makers and the public. In addition, the educational activities supported under this CAREER award advance science teaching at the high school, college, and graduate levels.<br/><br/>The research focuses specifically on cloud radiative effects (CREs), meaning the cooling caused by clouds as they reflect shortwave solar radiation back to space and the warming effect when they intercept outgoing longwave radiation emitted by the earth. In the deep clouds found in the eastern sector the longwave and shortwave effects show large cancellation, while shortwave cooling dominates in the low clouds on the western side. Preliminary work by the PI shows that, at least in the Southern Hemisphere, CRE evolves over the lifecycle of the cyclone, forming a north-south dipole during the decay phase with warming on the equatorward side. The north-south CRE dipole in the decaying stage could affect the meridional temperature gradient along the SH storm track, possibly helping to reestablish the meridional temperature contrast after cyclone passage and thus promoting further cyclone activity or influencing the latitude of the upper-level jet stream. The radiative effect of clouds around cyclones could also influence the behavior of low-frequency climate variability and secular climate change, both of which involve latitudinal shifts of jet streams and storm tracks. The work considers the dynamic and thermodynamic controls on the clouds as well as the influence of clouds on the midlatitude circulation. It is conducted through a combination of observational analysis and model simulation.<br/><br/>The educational component of the project includes efforts at the high school, college, and graduate level. At the high school level, the PI works with education experts at the Center for Teaching Excellence on the UVA campus, the Environmental Studies Academy (ESA) at Western Albermarle High School, and the University Corporation for Atmospheric Research (UCAR). The goal is to develop a teaching module to introduce high school students to the role of clouds in the climate system. The module will be disseminated nationally through the web portal at UCAR. Undergraduate education is promoted through the development of a course on climate modeling and analysis. One issue addressed by the course is the lack of computer skills commonly found among undergraduates, which limits their ability to engage in scientific research. The course involves training in the use of data analysis software and hands-on projects conducted by groups of two to three students. Students from the class are recruited to conduct research in the summers, with emphasis on the recruitment and retention of underrepresented minorities. On the graduate level, the project supports two students who, in addition to their research and classwork, serve as mentors for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As an example, for repairing broken bone, knowledge of the evolving damage determines how the polymeric biomedical implant can provide proper support and commensurately degrade and absorb into the body, while a broken bone heals. Currently design engineers lack the information necessary to predict the load carrying capacity of degradable polymeric components and, therefore, the designs are not optimal.  The results of this research will generate experimental data, mathematical models, and simulation tools that will uncover the relationship between chemical constituents and applied load on the degradation behavior of polymeric materials. That knowledge will enable improved engineering design in numerous applications where polymeric degradation occurs, thus advancing national prosperity and welfare along with scientific progress. The proposal includes an integrated education plan with several components, one of which is the development of new courses for undergraduate and graduate students at NJIT. The course material will also be modified and adapted into outreach programs for pre-college students through university-wide initiatives.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to bridge the behavioral knowledge gap currently limiting our predictive ability for polymeric materials undergoing degradation reactions due to hydrolysis or photo-degradation.

These lubricants are critical to our national defense and prosperity by impacting the many commercial applications where poor lubrication can lead to wear that limits the machine lifetime and wastes energy. The research will use atom-level tools to understand surface structure of these dry lubricants, with an emphasis on MoS2 which is the most important dry lubricants in use.

High biodiversity is often associated with a division of resources that allows many types of organisms to coexist with minimal competition. Indeed, unlike many other organisms on coral reefs, sponges are adapted to efficiently remove bacteria, phytoplankton, and dissolved organic matter from seawater by filter-feeding. Sponges are a dominant component of coral reefs worldwide and in the Caribbean, where their biomass exceeds that of reef-building corals. For almost a quarter century, the success of sponges in the Caribbean has been linked to their filter-feeding ability. However, recent work demonstrated that coexisting sponges on Caribbean reefs host unique communities of bacteria that might allow sponges to access multiple pools of nutrients that are not available to other organisms. In this project, the investigators will test the hypothesis that ecologically dominant sponge species in the Caribbean have unique metabolic strategies that are mediated by their associations with microbes that live within the sponge body. This research will combine manipulative field experiments with a novel combination of modern analytical tools to investigate both filter-feeding by sponge hosts and the metabolic pathways of their microbes.  This work will advance our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary forces that have helped shape the species present on Caribbean coral reefs. Additionally, this project will support three early-career investigators and provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at Nova Southeastern University, Appalachian State University, Stony Brook University, and Smithsonian Marine Station. The investigators will also develop innovative outreach programs that expand existing platforms at their institutions to increase public engagement and scientific literacy. <br/><br/>Marine sponges have been widely successful in their expansion across ecological niches in the Caribbean, with biomass often exceeding that of reef-building corals and high species diversity.  However, whether this success is linked to efficient heterotrophic filter-feeding on organic carbon in the water column or to their evolutionary investment in microbial symbionts is yet to be fully elucidated. Microbial symbionts expand the metabolic capabilities of host sponges, supplementing heterotrophic feeding with inorganic carbon and nitrogen, mediating the assimilation of dissolved organic matter, and facilitating recycling of host-derived nitrogen.  Despite these benefits, microbial symbiont communities are widely divergent across coexisting sponge species and there is substantial variation in host reliance on symbiont-derived carbon and nitrogen among host sponges; therefore, these associations likely mediate the ecological diversification of coexisting sponge species. The goal of this project is to test this transformative hypothesis by adopting an integrative approach to assess the individual components of holobiont metabolism (i.e., microbial symbionts and sponge host) in ten of the most common sponge species in the Caribbean. The investigators will isolate autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolic pathways and explore potential links between microbial symbiont community composition and the assimilation of particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM) from seawater. This project will elucidate whether Caribbean sponge species are on similar or divergent evolutionary trajectories, and will provide information that is critical for our understanding of how conditions in the Caribbean basin have shaped the evolution of benthic organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Intergranular fracture is a specific failure mode common in structural materials throughout the automotive, aerospace, energy, and petrochemical industries. This fracture mode is associated with segregation of elemental species to the area that separates two orientations of crystals, referred to as a grain boundary (GB). The directionality of the bonds formed by these segregated species are believed to influence the fundamental manner in which the fracture occurs. We will explore bonds that are parallel to the GB, perpendicular to the GB, or non-directional, using segregation of elements such as chromium, molybdenum, or sulfur, in iron. We can utilize novel, nano-sized mechanical testing techniques to confirm this effect. However, reducing the mechanical test sample volume to the nano-scale can itself alter the fracture mechanism. We can use irradiation to maintain realistic and appropriate fracture mechanics. These results potentially establish irradiation as a means to alleviate fracture between grains and reduce the impact of materials' fracture across numerous industries. We will also create a research and educational partnership with a local community college in order to boost community college student transfer and retention rates, and fill a STEM workforce need. We will give a lesson and interactive assignment on the societal importance of fracture in a pre-engineering community college course. Community college students will also participate directly in this research through an 11-week summer research internship. Best practices from this program will be shared via the PI's service in professional societies, and this model for a university-community college partnership can be extended to other universities.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>Intergranular fracture is a common failure pathway in structural alloys and recycled steels, especially those subject to high temperature operation or cyclic loading, in a multitude of industries. Recent advancements in computational materials science have provided tremendous insight into grain boundary embrittlement and intergranular fracture of metallic alloys. However, experimental approaches have not advanced correspondingly, preventing validation of mechanisms and hence limiting our ability to mitigate this crucial fracture path. Intergranular fracture is associated with solute segregation to grain boundaries (GBs), which is believed to increase the GB surface energy and decrease the GB cohesive energy, culminating in GB decohesion or cleavage. But there is mounting theoretical evidence that for segregating solutes exhibiting highly directional bonds with host atoms at/across the GB, fracture is not attributed to simple bond-breaking arguments, but rather to the inhibition of dislocation nucleation. These theories have not previously been verified because the direct observation of dislocation nucleation during crack propagation is extremely difficult. While the recent development of transmission electron microscopic (TEM) in situ mechanical testing enables such observations, reduced specimen volumes inhibit realistic fracture mechanisms. However, irradiation produces a sufficient defect density so as to reduce the characteristic length of the specimen, enabling bulk-like fracture mechanisms. Irradiation also drives solute segregation to GBs. Hence, we utilize irradiation to enable direct observation of GB separation and/or dislocation nucleation in real time with TEM in situ fracture testing. These results will validate cohesive finite element method (CFEM) models to develop predictive capabilities for intergranular fracture based on bonding anisotropies. Success of this project can lead to transformational irradiation-based approaches for mitigating GB embrittlement. We also develop a model for a university-community college research and education partnership to enhance community college student efficacy and build a diverse workforce having a breadth of skills, abilities, and education levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is much disagreement on whether we have already witnessed substantial impacts. The focal point of these debates is the question ""who-is-causing-who"", as changes in high latitudes take place at the same era as those in other latitudes, including mid-latitudes. The question how to infer the causality from data (observations and model outputs) is one of the most outstanding issues that the climate science community needs to resolve urgently. Here, the PI plans to apply causal discovery techniques, a unique type of statistical and data analysis, to the question of causal connections between the Arctic and mid-latitude circulation. These tools will provide insight into the causal pathways connecting Arctic temperatures to mid-latitude weather, quantify the ability of state-of-the-art climate models to simulate these pathways, and assess how these pathways may change in the coming decades. <br/><br/>The funded research will advance our understanding of the two-way links between the Arctic and mid-latitude weather, which in turn, can lead to improvements in short-term weather forecasts as well as improvements in predictions of weather/climate variability in the coming decades. In addition, this project will include the development of an online ""gateway"" of accessible explanations of data analysis techniques with accompanying atmospheric-science-motivated examples for atmospheric scientists: the Data Analysis Tools for Atmospheric Scientists (DATAS) Gateway. The recent explosion of climate data and increasing complexity of earth-system models requires that now, more than ever, atmospheric scientists be equipped with the necessary skills to make novel and robust discoveries. A joint community effort is planned for creating, testing, and disseminating the DATAS Gateway material. These community coordinated research/education activities include peer contributions and review, graduate student workshops, statistical and gateway-developer consultants, and integration into current and planned curricula across seven universities. The DATAS Gateway will not only be a resource for scientists across the globe, but will also allow for the sharing of ideas and tools, spur scientific breakthroughs and support five undergraduate researchers. A sustainability plan will be developed to transition the DATAS Gateway to a community-driven effort to ensure that it outlives the 5-year horizon of this CAREER grant. The project as a whole will additionally support a graduate student and individuals under-represented in STEM by supporting the efforts of six female faculty (the PI and five collaborators).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ultimate objective of the project is to rival the ability of animals to navigate daunting obstacles in order to reach a desired goal. In contrast to standard quasi-static approaches to robot path planning, these bio-inspired methods will allow highly dynamic behavior -- that is, during its motion the robot will be able to pass through positions that would be impossibly unbalanced if the robot was standing still. This may occur as the robot makes a continuous series of jumps, without pausing at the intermediate points. Numerical efficiency, provided by a hierarchical decomposition into well-behaved subproblems, will allow the trajectories to be computed as they are needed. First, solutions will be generated based on a greatly simplified dynamic model, in terms of ""global"" quantities that describe the translation and rotation of a robot-fixed reference frame. Of particular interest are the force pulses generated during the instants when the jumping robot is in contact with other objects. Possible solution trajectories will be grouped by the number of hops required to reach the destination and the foot locations on the obstacles. Finally a detailed solution will incorporate the ""shape"" variables that describe the configuration of the robot components with respect to the robot-fixed frame. The findings from this study will help lead to the creation of legged robots for use in inhospitable or dangerous real-world environments, including for disaster response, military applications, and exploration of inaccessible or inhospitable locations. The project will also build upon the appeal of agile legged robots for education and outreach to high school, undergraduate, and graduate students, including underrepresented minorities, to encourage the development of the next generation of engineers. <br/><br/>The objective of this study is to establish close connections between the mathematical modeling of legged robot systems, trajectory planning strategies, and the hardware design principles needed to create highly dynamic legged robots navigating complex unstructured environments.

Based on this understanding, a multilevel process will be sought for designing a collision-free feasible trajectory for the position variables, and then deforming the trajectory while gradually taking into account the effects of the shape variables. This will be achieved by (1) introducing model structures for legged robot systems that provide a hierarchical understanding and abstraction of complex dynamics, (2) establishing a trajectory-planning framework that combines approaches from convex optimization and numerical continuation methods by utilizing the newly obtained model structures, and (3) exploring hardware design principles that are tightly integrated with the trajectory-planning framework for rigorous validation and demonstration of the methods using torque-controlled robotic quadrupeds.

With that goal in mind, this CAREER project will contribute key innovations that allow robots to reason about the biomechanical safety of actions performed jointly with a human partner.  The research will focus on the concept of Preventive Robotics, a novel approach to human-machine collaboration that incorporates the biomechanical well-being of the human user into robot control and decision-making.  In contrast to Rehabilitation Robotics, which focuses on therapeutic procedures after an injury occurs, Preventive Robotics seeks to proactively reduce the risk of injury.  A critical knowledge gap in this regard is the absence of a theoretical foundation that supports human-machine symbiosis - healthy, physical, and bi-directional interactions between human and machine which can be comfortably sustained over very long periods of time.  The main objective of Preventive Robotics is to generate assistive robot actions that (a) seamlessly blend with actions of the human partner to achieve the intended function, while (b) minimizing biomechanical stress on the human body.  Coalescing these two goals will unlock new potential for robotics to drastically improve public and occupational health.  The project will also involve transition of innovations to a commercial partner developing intelligent lower-leg prostheses.  The research integrates with an education program targeting K-12 students, undergraduate and graduate students, and students from underrepresented groups.  <br/><br/>To these ends, the project will develop a unified Bayesian framework for modeling symbiotic dynamics among multiple agents using a compact probabilistic and data-driven methodology. The framework will bridge the divide between predictive modeling of humans and predictive control of symbiotic human-robot systems. A Bayesian representation will be used to derive algorithms for learning and adaptation which include the future biomechanical state of a human user. In addition, new symbiotic control algorithms will be introduced that utilize predicted biomechanical variables to steer the human-robot interaction towards biomechanically safe movement regimes. These control methods will provide new insights about strongly-coupled systems with reciprocal dependencies, in which only one system can be actively controlled (e.g., an assistive device or prosthesis). The new approach will be implemented on a powered-ankle prosthesis in order to anticipate joint loads and proactively avoid high stresses. The resulting prosthesis will have the potential to significantly lower the risk of musculoskeletal diseases such as osteoarthritis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The need for improving EPN resiliency is underscored by the surge in the extent and number of power outages due to the increasing frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as hurricanes and blizzards. The failure of aging EPN-supporting infrastructures, particularly during these weather events, can lead to widespread service disruptions, delays in emergency response, and significant economic losses. This research will have significant broader impacts on national prosperity and welfare, i.e., community and regional resiliency, as it will address the growing national need for the resilient design of critical civil infrastructures, such as EPNs, over their expected service life. The research will investigate the key attributes contributing to the resiliency of a transmission system within an EPN and will develop a robust, risk-informed design methodology to increase this resiliency. This will be achieved through a systematic incorporation of the physical performance assessment of individual transmission line components into a network-level functionality analysis. The project will include an integrated research and education plan, to train the next generation of natural hazards engineers and researchers, consisting of the following elements: (1) interactive educational components for high school students to foster their interest in the field of natural hazard engineering, (2) new curricula to prepare future engineers for the design and management of resilient infrastructures, (3) activities, including a multi-tiered mentoring program, to recruit and retain women and underrepresented minority students in the field of natural hazard engineering, and (4) university-industry partnerships to advise the research strategy and facilitate implementation of the research findings.  Data from this project will be archived and shared in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org).     <br/><br/>The research outcomes will foster a paradigm shift for the design of EPNs, which are recognized as one of the most critical spatially distributed infrastructure systems.  With a multiple threat perspective (windstorm and aging effects), the project will contribute to enhancing the resiliency of EPNs at both component and system levels. This will be achieved by: (1) fundamental advances in high-fidelity computational models supported by large-scale experimental testing, (2) investigation of uncertainties associated with changes in loading demand (due to extreme weather events) and structural capacity (due to aging mechanisms), (3) characterization of cascading effects at multiple tiers from a component failure to a network outage, (4) development of metamodels for EPNs under regional natural hazards and environmental stressors, and (5) integration of a system reliability analysis into an optimization platform to capture the consequences of possible failures and adjust the design requirements accordingly.

Galaxies merge from time to time, therefore it is expected, but not yet demonstrated, that recently merged galaxies hold two large black holes, which eventually form a bound pair and later merge. It is generally expected that supermassive black hole binaries can often accumulate sizable quantities of gas, and therefore be bright for a significant time before and during the merge, as well as the relaxation period there after.  However, because it is estimated that there are only very few such mergers per year in the entire Universe, understanding the specific features to search for is required to discover them. A team of researchers and graduate students from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), Johns Hopkins University (JHU), and the University of Tulsa (TU) propose to use the Blue Waters supercomputer to perform the first realistic simulations of gas surrounding supermassive binary black holes on route to merger.  These simulations will provide predictions of light and timing signatures emitted by supermassive black hole mergers in order to allow for their observational discovery.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is to define the features that identify the process of supermassive black hole mergers, using large-scale numerical simulations that assume astrophysically relevant initial conditions and include all the principal relevant physics: magnetohydrodynamics, general relativity, and radiation transfer.  These simulations are extremely challenging computationally because of the complexity of the physics involved. However, the project introduces two significant computation innovations: a time-dependent high-order post-Newtonian spacetime to substitute for explicit solution of the Einstein Field Equations and a multipatch scheme to coordinate separate treatment of regions with contrasting grid requirements.  In addition to the simulation activities, the project is expected to create opportunities to integrate many existing research programs into a larger community of scientists, students, and the general public. It will foster cross-disciplinary collaboration among undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and faculty at RIT, JHU and TU. Through this network, previous highly successful outreach programs will be able to reach an even larger and more diverse audience, and will provide many more opportunities for students to interact and collaborate with researchers outside their home institutions. It will also result in educating a number of graduate students and post-docs in the techniques of very large-scale computation, which will be important skills for their future careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, it is not uncommon for a system to expose hundreds of parameters to users for customizing configuration. Such high customizability comes at a price, as errors in configuration are a major source of system failures. While various solutions have been developed to tackle misconfiguration, they mainly focus on invalid configurations, which violate some correctness criteria. Unfortunately, many misconfigurations are technically valid, yet cause severe production problems such as poor performance. These are called specious configurations. The goal of this project is to systematically investigate and proactively prevent specious configurations.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project will study specious configuration from both open-source and commercial systems to understand its broad scope, traits and how it affects system execution. Informed by this study, this project will then design algorithms and techniques for modeling the risk of a configuration change by using static analysis and selective symbolic execution to construct parameterized impact tables and then enhance them with offline profiling data. Based on this model, this project will develop an online risk assessment tool which can alert expert operators about specious configuration before production.<br/><br/>Specious configuration is frequently cited for lost productivity.

It focuses on advancing our understanding of exchange processes of water and other constituents between the seabed and the overlying water under the action of waves. A systematic progression of experiments on flat, rippled and transitioning rippled bed regimes will be carried out using non-invasive laser-based techniques to obtain detailed observations of concentration and velocity fields with unprecedented resolution. A new collaboration with a numerical modeling group will inform the experiments, provide valuable data for cross-validation, and extend the research into more complex physics. The research will provide parameterizations describing ecological, biogeochemical and microbiological processes in the coastal benthic boundary layer and it will advance women and minorities in the fields of ocean sciences and engineering. The research program is integrated into a robust education plan through a variety of efforts, including the creation of a new course and enhancement of existing courses with unprecedented flow visualization and quantification techniques; the development of interactive modules on beach evolution and contamination; and the inception of a Graduate Fellowship Workshop series to coach students during the fellowship application process. This project will provide essential resources to advance the next generation of ocean scientists and engineers in Puerto Rico, and provide valuable role models for women and minorities.<br/><br/>This project examines the combined effect of complex roughness scales and spatially varying mass sources on scalar transport across the sediment-water interface under oscillating wave motion. It builds upon previous findings that demonstrate a high variability of momentum fluxes across the ripple wavelengths, and explores the effect of preferential organization of solutes on the overall mass exchange. Through a combination of detailed laboratory experiments (using PIV and PLIF), robust physics-based techniques for data reduction, and a new numerical modeling collaboration, this project will provide fundamental knowledge on the complex intra-ripple mixing structure resulting from a combination of unsteady hydrodynamic forcing, bedform-induced coherent motions, and nonuniform mass sources. Grounded on the PI's expertise in turbulent oscillatory flow over mobile rippled beds, this study has the potential to profoundly impact the way current deterministic models parameterize mass transport in coastal benthic boundary layers including contaminants, nutrients, and biogeochemical processes.

High biodiversity is often associated with a division of resources that allows many types of organisms to coexist with minimal competition. Indeed, unlike many other organisms on coral reefs, sponges are adapted to efficiently remove bacteria, phytoplankton, and dissolved organic matter from seawater by filter-feeding. Sponges are a dominant component of coral reefs worldwide and in the Caribbean, where their biomass exceeds that of reef-building corals. For almost a quarter century, the success of sponges in the Caribbean has been linked to their filter-feeding ability. However, recent work demonstrated that coexisting sponges on Caribbean reefs host unique communities of bacteria that might allow sponges to access multiple pools of nutrients that are not available to other organisms. In this project, the investigators will test the hypothesis that ecologically dominant sponge species in the Caribbean have unique metabolic strategies that are mediated by their associations with microbes that live within the sponge body. This research will combine manipulative field experiments with a novel combination of modern analytical tools to investigate both filter-feeding by sponge hosts and the metabolic pathways of their microbes.  This work will advance our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary forces that have helped shape the species present on Caribbean coral reefs. Additionally, this project will support three early-career investigators and provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at Nova Southeastern University, Appalachian State University, Stony Brook University, and Smithsonian Marine Station. The investigators will also develop innovative outreach programs that expand existing platforms at their institutions to increase public engagement and scientific literacy. <br/><br/>Marine sponges have been widely successful in their expansion across ecological niches in the Caribbean, with biomass often exceeding that of reef-building corals and high species diversity.  However, whether this success is linked to efficient heterotrophic filter-feeding on organic carbon in the water column or to their evolutionary investment in microbial symbionts is yet to be fully elucidated. Microbial symbionts expand the metabolic capabilities of host sponges, supplementing heterotrophic feeding with inorganic carbon and nitrogen, mediating the assimilation of dissolved organic matter, and facilitating recycling of host-derived nitrogen.  Despite these benefits, microbial symbiont communities are widely divergent across coexisting sponge species and there is substantial variation in host reliance on symbiont-derived carbon and nitrogen among host sponges; therefore, these associations likely mediate the ecological diversification of coexisting sponge species. The goal of this project is to test this transformative hypothesis by adopting an integrative approach to assess the individual components of holobiont metabolism (i.e., microbial symbionts and sponge host) in ten of the most common sponge species in the Caribbean. The investigators will isolate autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolic pathways and explore potential links between microbial symbiont community composition and the assimilation of particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM) from seawater. This project will elucidate whether Caribbean sponge species are on similar or divergent evolutionary trajectories, and will provide information that is critical for our understanding of how conditions in the Caribbean basin have shaped the evolution of benthic organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of their ability to store and transport large amounts of heat and to absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere, the world's oceans play a critical role in modulating environmental conditions for the sustained well-being of both land-based and marine organisms including humans.  Despite their recognized scientific and societal importance, long-term records of key ocean processes are rare.  In 1988, two ocean time-series programs were established: one in the North Atlantic near Bermuda and the other, the Hawaii Ocean Time-series (HOT) program, near Hawaii.  For the past three decades, teams of scientists based at the University of Hawaii have made critical measurements of the 'state of our sea.'  These long-term observations have established a baseline against which future states can be compared.  The ship-based HOT program complements other diverse ocean observation programs including remote-sensing via satellites, moored buoys, profiling floats, and autonomous underwater vehicles.  All HOT program data are publicly available and are frequently used by researchers and policy makers around the world.  Education, outreach, and training will continue to play prominent roles in the HOT program.  HOT provides a unique teaching and learning platform for high school, undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students and teachers from Hawaii and around the world.  The frequent cruises provide opportunities for students to gain first-hand exposure to ocean research.  In addition, HOT is a community resource that helps to support the efforts of numerous scientists worldwide who rely on the program's infrastructure (ship time, staff, laboratories, equipment) to conduct their own research, education, and outreach activities.  HOT program data are also widely used in classrooms and appear in textbooks on ocean science.  These sustained, interdisciplinary measurements are crucial for the validation of models that seek to predict global environmental change and its impact on society.<br/><br/><br/>The scientific mission of HOT is to investigate temporal dynamics in the cycling of carbon (C) and associated bioelements, and to observe the variability of hydrographical and ecological properties, heat fluxes, and circulation of the North Pacific Subtropical Gyre (NPSG), one of the largest biomes on Earth.  The proposed research will rely on shipboard measurements and deployments of in situ arrays conducted on 10 separate 5-day expeditions per annum, observations from a fleet of remotely operated vehicles, near-continuous moored platform measurements, and deep-moored sediment traps.  These diverse modes of observation, in conjunction with the extant HOT database, will document variability in ocean properties and processes over time scales ranging from diel to decadal.  This project maintains the high quality suite of biogeochemical and physical measurements required for the assessment of ocean C and nutrient pools and fluxes, plankton community structure, ecosystem productivity, and inherent optical properties of the water column.  Extending the length of program observations by an additional five years improves the value of the data sets for deciphering how low-frequency natural and anthropogenic signals influence ecosystem structure in the NPSG. The HOT site is one of only a few in the world where sustained air-sea carbon dioxide flux, primary production, export fluxes, upper ocean physical data, and meteorological observations are routinely made.  Such efforts continue to aid on-going modeling efforts required for predicting how future habitat perturbations may influence ecosystem dynamics in the NPSG and are crucial for the validation of models that seek to predict global environmental change and its impact on society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The emergence of particles with a size as tiny as a billionth of a meter (nanoparticles) can provide even more flexible and stronger materials with superior properties as billions of these particles can be incorporated into polymers to yield nanocomposite materials.  Modern chemistry can modify these nanoparticles at the molecular level, which leads to a substantial impact on their material behavior, often with unknown and novel properties. The challenge is to develop a relationship between molecular manipulations and macroscopic properties. This project approaches this task by controlling and varying the spatial distribution of the nanoparticles and by modifying the polymer molecules attached to the surfaces of these particles. The effects of nanoparticle confinement under these conditions will then be studied using advanced experimental techniques.  The project includes the understanding of the relationship between mechanical properties of the nanocomposite materials and the spatial distribution of the nanoparticles, as well as the theoretical description at the molecular length-scale.  This research is also integrated with education of students and exposing them to a variety of advanced experimental techniques.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The effects imposed by nanoconfinement on polymer melts will be studied in this research.  Emphasis will be on the manipulation of the chain dynamics by nanoparticle dispersion, surfaces, and the influence of chains grafted to surfaces. The current understanding is limited by knowledge gaps, which include a missing theoretical understanding of chain dynamics and how to distinguish effects of the particle dispersion and polymer chains. A holistic approach involving small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), dielectric spectroscopy (DS), and rheology, will be used to develop a theory based on recent progress to simultaneously describe the dielectric properties and rheology of polymer melts. Composites of NTPs (tethered chains on nanoparticles) dispersed in polymer matrices will be studied. The dispersion of the NTPs can be controlled by the grafting density, the molecular weight of free chains, and the corresponding characteristics of the NTPs. The static structure factor by SAXS can be used to obtain a phase map of systems with agglomerated and non-agglomerated particles, and to provide information on the length-scale of the confinement. The influence of the additional confinement imposed by nanoparticles on the chain dynamics will be explored, together with a change of the tube diameter of the polymer caused by surfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The focus will be three factors that affect not only prairie dogs, but also hundreds of other vertebrate social species: non-parental infanticide, alarm calling, and polyandry (a single female mating with two or more males). The synthesis will examine how these factors have influenced the costs and benefits of social life within prairie dog colonies. Two products of the research will result: a book that will present the synthesis to a wide scientific audience and a website featuring decades of images, audio recordings, videos, and datasets directed at high school students, undergraduates, and other curious naturalists of all ages. Finally, the researcher will continue to collaborate with four television companies - including National Geographic Television - that have recently documented his research with prairie dogs. This research provides insights into the evolution of common, but poorly understood, social behaviors in mammals; the products will be of broad interest to behavioral ecologists, wildlife managers, and conservation biologists.<br/><br/>Social species exhibit several initially puzzling behaviors, and this project aims to pull together four decades of data on prairie dog species to understand three such behaviors: non-parental infanticide, alarm calling, and polyandry. Each of these behaviors seems detrimental to fitness on the surface and hence requires focused investigation to understand. This project will leverage long term data following the behavior of individuals over their lifetime and their reproductive success to understand these phenomena. In particular, the synthesis will include new analyses focused on the role of colony density on the frequency of infanticide, the costs and benefits to an individual that gives an alarm call, which may draw a predator's attention, and the costs and benefits of multiple matings by females. This will be the first study to elucidate the consistency and contingency of these behaviors over a life time and the consequences for fitness. The analyses will clarify the maintenance of coloniality despite these apparent costs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With support from the National Science Foundation, an electrochemistry research program will be established at Albany State University (ASU) where teaching and research in this field are scant. Additionally, critical issues in sustainable energy research will be integrated into undergraduate education at this predominantly African American teaching institution, which serves mainly minority, underserved students. This program will link STEM education and research by integrating fundamental principles of electrochemistry with hands-on experience in renewable energy, to produce better learning outcomes and ensure success in both college and the job market for ASU graduates. <br/><br/>The long term goal of this project is to address issues related to renewable energy and its safe and sustainable conversion and storage in batteries for use in appropriate devices. The researchers hypothesize that electrolytes that can be used in non-polar solvents could expand the ability to test other redox-active materials, which may improve the performance of Organic Radical Batteries (ORBs) and Organic Redox Flow Batteries (ORFBs). ORBs and ORFBs offer the possibility of manufacturing lightweight and flexible devices with comparable performance but better safety than lithium-based batteries and for which increasing demands exist already. A series of weakly coordinating anions (WCAs) and cations (WCCs) featuring polysubstituted tetraarylphosphonium/tetrakis(pentafluorophenyl)borate salts will be synthesized as novel electrolytes to enable electrochemistry in low-polarity media. Electrochemical measurement will then be conducted in non-polar solvents with electrolytes designed to be soluble in the solvents, having increased ion mobility and, therefore, improved relative conductivities. Pulse radiolysis experiments including time-resolved mid-infrared studies will be employed to determine redox potentials of redox-active molecules in non-polar solvents and, possibly to measure redox potentials in an electrolyte-free environment for the first time. Redox potential determinations in non-polar environments can be applied to a wider range of fields in science and engineering, including organic synthesis, petroleum handling in pipelines, energy, and biology. The energy community will benefit from the comprehensive results of this project as newly designed electrolytes and superior measurement of redox potentials will lead to a better understanding of energy storage by electron transfer, especially as ORBs and ORFBs.

High biodiversity is often associated with a division of resources that allows many types of organisms to coexist with minimal competition. Indeed, unlike many other organisms on coral reefs, sponges are adapted to efficiently remove bacteria, phytoplankton, and dissolved organic matter from seawater by filter-feeding. Sponges are a dominant component of coral reefs worldwide and in the Caribbean, where their biomass exceeds that of reef-building corals. For almost a quarter century, the success of sponges in the Caribbean has been linked to their filter-feeding ability. However, recent work demonstrated that coexisting sponges on Caribbean reefs host unique communities of bacteria that might allow sponges to access multiple pools of nutrients that are not available to other organisms. In this project, the investigators will test the hypothesis that ecologically dominant sponge species in the Caribbean have unique metabolic strategies that are mediated by their associations with microbes that live within the sponge body. This research will combine manipulative field experiments with a novel combination of modern analytical tools to investigate both filter-feeding by sponge hosts and the metabolic pathways of their microbes.  This work will advance our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary forces that have helped shape the species present on Caribbean coral reefs. Additionally, this project will support three early-career investigators and provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at Nova Southeastern University, Appalachian State University, Stony Brook University, and Smithsonian Marine Station. The investigators will also develop innovative outreach programs that expand existing platforms at their institutions to increase public engagement and scientific literacy. <br/><br/>Marine sponges have been widely successful in their expansion across ecological niches in the Caribbean, with biomass often exceeding that of reef-building corals and high species diversity.  However, whether this success is linked to efficient heterotrophic filter-feeding on organic carbon in the water column or to their evolutionary investment in microbial symbionts is yet to be fully elucidated. Microbial symbionts expand the metabolic capabilities of host sponges, supplementing heterotrophic feeding with inorganic carbon and nitrogen, mediating the assimilation of dissolved organic matter, and facilitating recycling of host-derived nitrogen.  Despite these benefits, microbial symbiont communities are widely divergent across coexisting sponge species and there is substantial variation in host reliance on symbiont-derived carbon and nitrogen among host sponges; therefore, these associations likely mediate the ecological diversification of coexisting sponge species. The goal of this project is to test this transformative hypothesis by adopting an integrative approach to assess the individual components of holobiont metabolism (i.e., microbial symbionts and sponge host) in ten of the most common sponge species in the Caribbean. The investigators will isolate autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolic pathways and explore potential links between microbial symbiont community composition and the assimilation of particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM) from seawater. This project will elucidate whether Caribbean sponge species are on similar or divergent evolutionary trajectories, and will provide information that is critical for our understanding of how conditions in the Caribbean basin have shaped the evolution of benthic organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some regions, VBDs, such as malaria and dengue, have resurged where previous elimination campaigns have waned. In other places, the novel introduction and spread of vectors and pathogens, for example the Asian citrus psyllid and with it huanglongbing (citrus greening), is occurring due to human facilitated introductions (long distance travel events, shipping containers, etc.). Transmission of VBDs is complex. The patterns of transmission that we observe are determined by interactions between vectors, pathogens, hosts, and their environment. Most disease vectors are small arthropods; they are sensitive to environmental conditions, such as temperature or rainfall. It is vitally important to understand how these factors and conditions affect the dynamics of the vectors in order to better inform strategies for monitoring and mitigation of VBDs. This CAREER project will further a general understanding of how environmentally-mediated traits of vectors (e.g. longevity and fecundity) interact with environmental factors to impact the transmission of VBDs. Improved quantitative methods will be developed for predicting when and where transmission will occur and for estimation of the uncertainty in these predictions.  <br/><br/>This CAREER project addresses three main questions: (1) How do we quantify and model the impacts of environmental drivers on multiple correlated traits of vectors and thus on VBD transmission dynamics? (2) How can we link mechanistic or model-based measures of transmission with statistical models of incidence/transmission to improve predictions of when and where VBD transmission or emergence may occur? (3) How can we integrate multiple sources of uncertainty into our models/predictions and how can we communicate this uncertainty in a way that is useful for decision making? The PI will tackle these questions with a trait-based framework, initially focusing on two very different but data rich study systems, dengue and huanglongbing. More specifically, mechanistic mathematical models that include details on environmentally mediated vector traits, including trait correlation and heterogeneity, will first be developed.  These models will be parameterized and validated with data from open data repositories using a Bayesian approach. Methods and tools will be developed for validating these models, for properly quantifying sources and types of uncertainty, and for testing interventions and making policy decisions under uncertainty. Through an integrated approach to statistical training and collaboration with current researchers in the Virginia Department of Health (VDH), the project will improve the quantitative and statistical capabilities of future researchers and public health officials and policy makers. In particular, the work will include: a) Development of tools and training materials for VDH employees to use cutting edge modeling techniques; b) Training and experience for undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers in public health collaboration through interactions with the VDH; c) Training of undergraduate biologists in statistics through a revitalized Biological Statistics course at Virginia Tech; d) Undergraduate research experience in quantitative biology with a focus on VBDs; e) Training of graduate students in teaching and mentoring through a seminar course on statistics pedagogy and through opportunities to co-mentor undergraduate researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ultimate goal of this work is to improve fundamental understanding, and eventually enable better prediction, of the material properties that ultimately control complex processes in nature, many of which have enormous impacts on people and on society. For the three-year grant period, one emphasis will be on the effects of high pressure on the structure and properties of silicate melts that represent magmas in the Earth, and hence are tied to many geological processes including the formation and eruption of volcanoes. A second major activity will be further development and application of methods to measure the distribution of minor and major elements in some of the most important silicate minerals in the Earth's crust and mantle, in order to improve models that describe their chemical behavior in nature, and thus better our ability to glean clues about geological evolution from natural samples. Results and methods developed in this project should continue to be of major interest outside of the Earth sciences, particularly for researchers working to develop and optimize silicate glasses and ceramics for advanced technologies, such as materials for data processing and transmission, computer displays, substrates for photovoltaics, fuel cells, and many other applications. Education is central to this project, since most of the research will be part of the training of Ph.D. and postdoctoral students on their ways to careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/>The approach taken in this research is to identify important problems where critical details of short- to intermediate-range structure are needed and can be elucidated by laboratory measurements, collect accurate data on synthetic or natural materials, and determine the consequences of the results for key chemical and physical parameters. The most important experimental approach that will be used is solid-state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which can reveal quantitative details about the structure around many of the components common in minerals and magmas, such as silicon, aluminum, oxygen, phosphorus, and sodium. A variety of compositions of glasses (representing the high temperature molten materials in natural magma systems) and crystalline materials will be synthesized, and measurements made of how their structures change with composition, temperature and pressure. One particular emphasis will be to continue to extend the applicability of NMR, traditionally used to look at abundant constituents of non-magnetic materials, to minor and even trace components and to materials containing substantial amounts of magnetic components. These data should be particularly important in helping to develop more accurate, physically-based models of mineral and magma properties and behavior, which are especially important in the Earth sciences, as many processes take place in regimes of temperature, pressure, and time that are inaccessible to direct observation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The RIA projects are expected to help further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, to improve research and teaching at their home institution, and to involve undergraduate students in research experiences. With support from the National Science Foundation, Prairie View A & M University (PVAMU) seeks to conduct a research project that bridges the academic units of biology, ecology, agriculture, bioinformatics and imaging.  This study assesses the impact of acetic acid on the two forms of Amaranthus palmeri and creates a baseline of genomic data. This project is a collaboration with the PVAMU Computational Center and provides funds for two undergraduates to engage in research each semester. Students involved with the project will be closely mentored. This will include teaching them new scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and computational skills, preparing then to make poster presentations at local/national research symposia and/or conferences and discussing long term career goals. Project results will inform scientists and the agricultural community about which varying concentrations of acetic acid can best be used as a sustainable method of organic weed control. The idea for any growth control agent is to use the least amount of chemical and cause the least amount of change to the environment.<br/><br/>Traditional herbicides and growth control agents contain glyphosate based compounds and were initially thought to cause minimal change to the environment. After continued use of these compounds, scientists noticed that some weeds, including A. palmeri, became resistant to the glyphosate based herbicides, thus debunking the idea of minimal harm to the environment. The information gained from the study will provide significant information to evolutionary science because the two versions of A. palmeri evolved in a relatively short time frame. Changes in the genome from year to year and region to region will be assessed and related to acetic acid treatments. The genomic data will provide insight into the evolutionary changes at the genome level.  When plants are stressed, they often exhibit changes in the leaf structures, microbiota and genome.  Scanning Electron Microscopy will be used to determine the most vulnerable stages of plant development impacted by acetic acid and show changes in leaf surface structures and genetic profile. The study also analyzes the impact that timing of the application of acetic acid has on growth control. The results will have implications for other weeds. The project is expected to show that when acetic acid is applied early and before the desired crop emerges, there will be less change/damage to the environment. Applying acetic acid at the right time and using it as an organic weed control will serve as a model technique/practice for producers and will lower their cost while increasing productivity. This project is novel because it uses genomic data to assess the effects of acetic acid treatments at each stage of development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gorski <br/>Proposal Number: 	1749207 <br/><br/>The goal of this research will be to address two major national issues: provide the public with access to clean water and affordable electricity. The research focuses on developing devices like batteries that can use electricity to desalinate water. In addition,these devices can also produce electricity by mixing seawater with freshwater, a key benefit to coastal areas of the United States. The research aims to optimize the materials used in these devices through scientific inquiry. The goal of the education plan is to improve student learning related to water and energy issues. The PI will study how pre-existing misconceptions prevent learning, and identify ways to improve understanding and employ alternative teaching methods to correct misconceptions. <br/><br/>The research focuses on novel, battery-inspired electrochemical cells that can be used to desalinate water or generate electricity from salinity gradients.  Several electrochemical technologies have been proposed for these purposes in the past, but their performances have been too low to significantly impact the water and energy sectors due partially to their reliance on carbon electrodes. The central hypothesis of the research is that using battery-inspired metal-based electrodes will lead to dramatic improvements in system performance. This hypothesis is supported by preliminary results demonstrating that the classes of proposed electrode materials can greatly increase the energy efficiency of desalinating water and increase the amount of electrical power produced from salinity gradients relative to existing technologies. To test this hypothesis, the PI will focus on four classes of metal-based electrode materials known to interact with sodium ions in water. The overall goal of the research is to construct a framework for rationally selecting electrode materials for desalinating water and harvesting salinity gradient energy. To achieve this goal, the proposed research will use a combination of electrochemical methods, material characterization techniques, and aquatic chemistry measurements to methodically investigate the relationships that exist among the materials? (1) charging mechanisms, (2) electrochemical properties, and (3) performances in desalinating water or harvesting salinity gradient energy. The PI will also assess how trace elements and fouling agents present in real waters affect electrode performance. The goal of the education plan is to identify student misconceptions related to electrochemistry, energy production, and water quality and treatment and to test the effectiveness of inquiry-based teaching methods for overcoming them. A misconception is conceptual knowledge that is inconsistent with commonly accepted and provable scientific consensuses. Overcoming misconceptions is critical for developing deep conceptual knowledge that is important both for professional work and daily life. The proposed work will leverage the PI?s ongoing outreach and educational efforts to identify and repair misconceptions among engineering students studying electrochemistry and grade 6-8 students studying water and energy issues. The research is transformative in that it will lead to a fundamental understanding of faradaic electrode material charging mechanisms, which can be applied to the design and modification of materials used for desalinating water and harvesting salinity gradient energy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Developing vibrant communities can help boost commercial activities, enhance public security, foster social interaction and, thus, yield livable, sustainable, and viable environments. With the advent of the mobile and sensing technologies, big crowd-sourced geo-tagged data (BCGD) are increasingly available from diverse sources (e.g., buildings, vehicles, human, sensors, devices) in urban space, and represent an invaluable source of intelligence for understanding urban vibrancy and enhancing smart growth. This project will develop novel, systematical, and effective analytical techniques to significantly advance critical problems in urban vibrancy by taking advantage of the wealth of BCGD. The algorithms and tools developed in this project will directly impact community planning,  city governance, and urban economics. The educational component of this project includes developing a new curriculum that incorporates research into the classroom and provides students from under-represented groups with opportunities to participate in research.<br/><br/><br/>This project will develop new analytical techniques to discover, analyze, and leverage the patterns within and the relationships among BCGD to understand and sustain urban vibrancy. Novel methodologies that are appropriate to urban vibrancy will be designed in three directions: measurements, patterns, and mechanism. In researching measurements, axioms that a metric of urban vibrancy should satisfy will be introduced, and principled metrics will be devised to evaluate community vibrancy and learn how it is distributed. In researching patterns, an analytic framework will be proposed to discover the complex patterns of spatial configuration from BCGD for urban vibrancy. This framework aims to identify the compatible dimensions and corresponding measuring methods, as well as optimal portfolios and geographic presentation of spatial configuration. In researching mechanism, new machine learning models will be developed to examine the impact of spatial configuration on urban vibrancy by exploiting the conformity between spatial view and mobility view and the regularity of geographic dependencies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the biggest challenges is the establishment of a corresponding processing science that integrates these wafer-based technologies with the extraordinary optical, electronic, and chemical properties derived from metallic nanoparticles. Device prototyping has, however, been stifled by an inability to define complex metal nanostructures in organized patterns where interactions are possible between adjacent structures and with the underlying wafer material. The project being carried out aims to overcome this impediment by redefining the methodologies, instrumentation, and processing science needed to define wafer-based metal nanostructures, and in doing so, provide the capabilities inaccessible through conventional methods. The research activities are being integrated with undergraduate education that involves the supervision of research internships geared toward the advancement of laboratory instrumentation by students from the College of Engineering. Outreach activities place emphasis on the matriculation of women into the engineering profession.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>The research being carried out aims to provide an understanding of the altered chemistry that arises when well-understood seed-mediated noble metal nanostructure growth modes are subjected to four unconventional synthetic levers that become accessible when seeds are immobilized on a rigid crystalline substrate. It is founded on a synthetic strategy that is able to realize periodic arrays of complex noble metal nanostructures through a three stage synthetic scheme that uses (i) a lithography-defined shadow mask to fabricate nanostructured precursors at site-specific locations, (ii) directed assembly to transform them into single crystal templates, and (iii) solution-based chemistry to further transform them into complex nanostructures. Within the scope of this strategy lies the opportunity to incorporate a new set of synthetic levers into nanostructure synthesis that fundamentally alter well-established growth modes. The project is advancing the use and understanding of four such synthetic levers: (i) a flow of reactants past an anchored substrate, (ii) synthetically-active substrate materials, (iii) substrate-imposed epitaxy, and (iv) lithographically-imposed barriers to growth. Graduate students are being trained in nanostructure synthesis and characterization, lithographic techniques, and the preparation nanostructured surfaces. This work is, hence, contributing to the grander vision that sees the extraordinary physicochemical properties of nanomaterials united with the wafer-based materials, processing techniques, and electronic devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because an offline attacker can validate each password guess by itself using stolen password hashes from a data breach it is not possible to ""lock out"" an offline attacker after several incorrect guesses. The attacker is limited only by the computational resources necessary to mount a brute-force attack. To mitigate the risk of an offline attack the goal of a secure password hashing algorithm is to ensure that a brute force attack is prohibitively expensive even if the attacker has access to customized hardware such as an Application Specific Integrated Circuit (ASIC) that is optimized for password cracking. Memory hard functions (MHFs), functions whose computation require a large amount of memory, are a crucial cryptographic tool to achieve this goal since memory is expensive even on an ASIC. This project advances scientific understanding of memory hard functions and will directly impact future cryptographic standards for password hashing.<br/><br/>The project is developing improved cryptanalysis techniques to evaluate the security of an MHF resulting in a deeper understanding of currently deployed MHFs.

Their dried, pressed specimens are of multidimensional importance: they are documentation of plant occurrence through space and time; markers of taxonomic and nomenclatural identity; evidence of plant-animal interactions; and sources of DNA for molecular studies. In recent years, there has been a resurgence in the acknowledgement of the importance of natural history specimens to modern biological research. Despite this resurgence and broad application of specimens in research a number of herbaria in Louisiana have recently closed and the collections orphaned. The Shirley C. Tucker Herbarium at Louisiana State University (LSU) has been the recipient of a large portion of these orphaned collections.  This has resulted in a near doubling in the size of the collection, from 207,500 specimens in 2015 to an estimated 400,000.  This project will result in the integration and consolidation of these specimens into the Tucker Herbarium's infrastructure, as well as completion of prior digitization efforts. This project will not only ensure that Louisiana's botanical heritage is available to interested researchers, but also foster an understanding of the importance of plants and natural history collections via outreach projects aimed at the broader public, undergraduate students, and the academic community.<br/><br/>The incorporation of multiple orphaned herbaria at LSU presents an opportunity to restructure the Tucker Herbarium into a regional hub for Louisiana botany.  This project will integrate the recently acquired herbarium specimens into LSU's compacted herbarium infrastructure, as well as consolidate multiple digital data sources.  Both of these steps are crucial for the maintenance and maximum utility of the much larger collection that will be housed at the Tucker Herbarium by 2020.  Challenges related to the integration of different filing schemes and database structures will be addressed by project personnel and their solutions will be presented at national conferences.  Additionally, continued digitization efforts will result in a nearly complete online database with image records of the Louisiana flora.  All associated data will be publicly accessible and linked to multiple consortium and data aggregation efforts, including SERNEC, iDigBio, and GBIF.  Integration and digitization activities will be coupled with the development of a rotating public exhibit to feature Tucker Herbarium research and activities, the inauguration of an annual plant biology seminar at LSU, and the establishment of a stronger presence, both online via social media campaigns and on campus via participation in outreach activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Continued performance of civil structures in daily use and after a natural hazard event is critical to the resilience of our communities and the US economy. The integration of sensor networks and physical systems is essential for maintaining this continued performance of civil structures while facing challenges in aging, energy, and the environment. The interaction of these cyber-physical components impacts almost every endeavor today and is indispensable in tackling today's broader challenges and continued US economic growth. This research project will identify optimal network systems for infrastructure applications through the integration of virtual and physical sensors and actuators. Unlike current approaches that are limited to specific measurement technology, function, and/or application, the new network approach is scalable to monitor large structures, as well as to provide insight on performance limits and maximize the reliability of the selected network configuration. Experimental modules will be developed based on the framework of this research through student's design projects and will be used to create an interactive outreach platform for students in secondary school.<br/><br/>Effective implementation of sensor and actuator networks necessitates that limited sensor resources provide the most informative measured data and are reliable in the face of uncertainties. The objective of this research is a framework to identify the bounds of algorithm performance for structural health monitoring and control applications through optimization of sensor placement, type, and configuration in the presence of uncertainties. The multi-objective optimization sensor approach will be validated with results from physical tests ranging from laboratory-scale monitoring and control experiments through in-situ deployments. Key results include: (i) a sparsity-promoting algorithm to determine near-optimal sensor requirements for effective response and parameter estimation, (ii) insight into the performance bounds for estimation-based algorithms, and (iii) a novel experimental approach for validation of the technique under repeated, non-idealized conditions to establish the reliability of estimation-based approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the significant growth in the wireless data traffic has initiated the need for expanding the range of frequencies used for wireless communication. Visible Light Communication (VLC), where light is used as a medium for communication, has garnered significant attention over recent years due to its potential for ultra-high speeds. However, with rapid advancements in VLC, the communication speeds achieved so far are orders of magnitude less than its potential Terabits-per-second (Tbps) capacity. There is an urgent need for a breakthrough in VLC data speeds, and this project attempts to move toward it through a novel system architecture to support ultra-high data rates. The project will take advantage of industry meetings to disseminate outcomes and provides a variety of appealing educational activities involving high school and undergraduate students. This project makes an experimental VLC kit available to the community and makes the hardware, software implementation and data generated available to the public.<br/><br/>Theoretical models estimate VLC information capacity to be of the order of Tbps, however, practical limitations in receiver designs have limited state-of-the-art VLC prototypes to data rates that are lower by orders of magnitude. To achieve high-speed reception, this project combines the fast sampling nature of photodiodes and the noise isolation property of imaging array structures into a unified structure that emulates a high-speed image sensing receiver. This project designs a novel VLC receiver architecture integrating a photodiode and an LCD array that acts as a pixelated shutter. Through this unified design, the receiver selects the exact area over which the transmitted signal is detected on the array, thus isolating actual light signal from ambient noise reaching the photodiode, resulting in a dramatic increase in the Signal to Noise Ratio (SNR).  The signal isolation and SNR enhancement is enabled by the spatio-temporal mechanisms for selective signal reception and tracking on the LCD array. To achieve a larger field-of-view for reception, the receiver is fit with an 180-degree panoramic lens. This project develops a model to understand the relationship between spatial mobility and the light signal's location on the array and its strength and sets a baseline for designing signal tracking mechanisms to address mobility in high-speed VLC systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, even the most sophisticated systems are often constrained by design limits and/or may experience occasional malfunctions requiring human-in-the-loop manual interventions.  To date, there is no consensus on how best to assist operators of varying age and ability levels in noticing, diagnosing, and recovering manual control across a wide range of autonomous systems.  Adults 65 years and older are now the fastest growing age group, and are expected to encounter systems with increasing levels of automation throughout later stages of life, yet perceptual and cognitive challenges often prevent their effective use of such technology.  The goals of this project are to better understand age-related differences in human-automation interactions, and to begin the development of methods and tools that support the manual recovery of older adults for various automated technologies.  Combined sensory feedback will be explored as a potential technique to these ends, as it has been shown to improve attention management and benefit older individuals.  Project outcomes will contribute to a more in-depth understanding of the capabilities and limitations of different operator demographics, and will help guide the development of next generation human-machine interfaces.  The work has broader implications for enhancing safety in many complex operations, such as autonomous driving and automated process assembly.  Public educational activities will include community and study population (senior) focused workshops, pre-college and summer outreach, and undergraduate research programs for underrepresented students.<br/><br/>Multimodal interfaces present information to the visual, auditory, and tactile sensory channels.  By manipulating signal parameters, these interfaces are able to capture attention, inform operators of system status, and provide decision aids to perform needed actions.  However, the extent to which this approach can effectively communicate to a range of operators with considerable variability in sensory and cognitive abilities in the context of transfer-of-authority has not been quantified.  Given the rapid development of advanced autonomous technology and the projected population changes expected within the next decade, it will be critical to fill these research gaps.  This project will generate age-related empirical data on complex interactions within autonomous systems.  A series of experiments will be conducted using semi-autonomous driving simulations and involving subjects from different age groups.  The research will quantify age-related time differences in noticing multimodal transition (takeover) requests, determine age-specific transition times as a function of lead time and sensory modality notification, and investigate the effectiveness of various tactile signals to support situation awareness and reduce transition times.  Results are expected to inform quantitative and qualitative models of human perception, information processing, and performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Galaxies merge from time to time, therefore it is expected, but not yet demonstrated, that recently merged galaxies hold two large black holes, which eventually form a bound pair and later merge. It is generally expected that supermassive black hole binaries can often accumulate sizable quantities of gas, and therefore be bright for a significant time before and during the merge, as well as the relaxation period there after.  However, because it is estimated that there are only very few such mergers per year in the entire Universe, understanding the specific features to search for is required to discover them. A team of researchers and graduate students from the Rochester Institute of Technology (RIT), Johns Hopkins University (JHU), and the University of Tulsa (TU) propose to use the Blue Waters supercomputer to perform the first realistic simulations of gas surrounding supermassive binary black holes on route to merger.  These simulations will provide predictions of light and timing signatures emitted by supermassive black hole mergers in order to allow for their observational discovery.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is to define the features that identify the process of supermassive black hole mergers, using large-scale numerical simulations that assume astrophysically relevant initial conditions and include all the principal relevant physics: magnetohydrodynamics, general relativity, and radiation transfer.  These simulations are extremely challenging computationally because of the complexity of the physics involved. However, the project introduces two significant computation innovations: a time-dependent high-order post-Newtonian spacetime to substitute for explicit solution of the Einstein Field Equations and a multipatch scheme to coordinate separate treatment of regions with contrasting grid requirements.  In addition to the simulation activities, the project is expected to create opportunities to integrate many existing research programs into a larger community of scientists, students, and the general public. It will foster cross-disciplinary collaboration among undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers and faculty at RIT, JHU and TU. Through this network, previous highly successful outreach programs will be able to reach an even larger and more diverse audience, and will provide many more opportunities for students to interact and collaborate with researchers outside their home institutions.

Consider a ball on a frictionless table. If the ball is set in motion, it will travel forever, making perfectly elastic collisions with the walls. If the table is a square or an equilateral triangle, there are only two possible behaviors: either the ball repeats the same periodic path forever, or it travels completely randomly in the entire polygon, eventually visiting every part of the table. This project is directed toward the basic mathematical problem of understanding the behavior of a ball when the table is a more general polygon. This is a basic problem arising in physics and statistical mechanics. The PI and his collaborators will also study other systems with similar behaviour. <br/><br/>The project concerns the study of measure rigidity for actions of non-abelian groups, in the general context of smooth ergodic theory. Measure rigidity is traditionally studied in the context of homogeneous dynamics. Some spectacular results, such as Ratner's theorem and other advances in this direction are at the heart of the subject and its many applications. In recent work with M. Mirzakhani and in part with A. Mohammadi, the PI was able to prove dynamical rigidity results similar to Ratner's theorem in the context of Teichmueller dynamics, which is a non-homogeneous setting (and is not conjecturally conjugate to a homogenous action). In joint work with E. Lindenstrauss, these ideas were used in the homogeneous dynamics setting to prove an improved version of the celebrated Benoist-Quint theorem. In this project, the PI intends to go beyond Teichmueller and homogeneous dynamics and prove similar rigidity theorems in the much more general setting of smooth dynamics. It is expected that the results will be applied to some explicit examples, without the need for perturbation. This should have some applications outside the field, for examples, to geometry and number theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of the cream, soap, and gel we use in everyday life, the food we eat, and the biological matter we are made of is classified as soft material. Soft materials include matter such as colloidal dispersions (paints, milk), polymers (plastics, fibers), biological matter (proteins, cells), and liquid crystals (electronic displays). The PI is particularly motivated by biological soft materials that dynamically change their shape in response to chemical and mechanical cues. For example, proteins change conformations in response to changes in ion concentration to enable specific biological processes, and red blood cells deform reversibly to enable their passage through thin capillaries. Researchers have long sought to mimic this intrinsic adaptability of biological materials in the design of synthetic matter. In this project, the PI will develop powerful computational methods to link the inherent attributes of soft-matter-based nanoparticles with their mechanistic behavior, including stable shapes, real-time shape evolution, and self-organization into larger nanostructures.<br/><br/>The PI's research team will program the surface charge and elasticity patterns of charged soft-matter-based nanoparticles such as virus-like nanocages and polymeric nanomembranes to enable controlled shape adaptation. Establishing the links between surface pattern and shape will guide the development of deformable nanocontainers into drug-delivery carriers that adapt their shape to evolving physiological conditions and biological barriers. The findings will also elucidate the principles of designing shape-reconfigurable nanoparticles that can act as building blocks of next-generation materials with responsive properties tailored for specific applications, such as shape-shifting microrobots and functional coatings with adaptive optical response.<br/><br/>The education and outreach components of this project are directly integrated with its research investigations. The PI will lead a simulation-to-3D-printing workshop for high-school students in Bloomington, Indiana, where they will become familiar with applications of computing tools and fabrication techniques while learning about the design of matter at the nanoscale. The PI's team will design web-based science gateways to bring the computational methods developed in this project to classrooms in and outside of Indiana University, and facilitate the learning of underrepresented students at Minority-Serving Institutions. The PI is in a unique position to play a pivotal role in the design and implementation of a brand-new undergraduate program focused on nanoscale engineering that will significantly impact Indiana University, as it will train a diverse pool of undergraduate students to develop advances in nanotechnology.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports computational and theoretical research and education to identify the fundamental mechanisms of engineering adaptive shape control in soft-matter-based nanoparticles. Harnessing the adaptability of biological materials in synthetic matter is one of the biggest challenges in materials engineering. The PI is deeply inspired by biology, where viral capsomeres self-assemble into rods and spheres which display shape adaptation, and where proteins selectively bind to viruses that exhibit unique combinations of surface pattern and shape. With such instances in mind, in this project, the PI will connect the surface patterning to mechanistic behavior for nanoparticles made from charged soft materials, such as virus-like nanocontainers, micellar vesicles, and polymeric nanomembranes. The PI's research team will investigate how surface charge and elasticity patterns affect the overall shape of these nanoparticles, and how these patterns control the timescales of shape-switching and aggregation of nanoparticles in physiological conditions. Molecular dynamics simulations will be used to probe surface charge and elasticity patterns that 1) enable nanoparticle shape adaptation, and 2) control real-time shape-switching and assembly of nanoparticles into higher-order nanostructures.<br/><br/>The PI will develop molecular dynamics methods that are uniquely capable of connecting the smaller length-scale effects of counterion condensation on nanoparticle surfaces to the larger length-scale aggregation behavior of nanoparticles. Based on this multiscale information, this research will produce maps that link surface patterns to equilibrium and dynamical properties of the shapes of virus-like nanoparticles and polymeric nanomembranes for a wide range of environmental conditions. These maps will help guide the design of deformable nanoparticles that can actively change shape and associated functionalities, advancing the current capabilities for engineering biomimetic nanocontainers for applications in targeted drug-delivery. This research will also expand the synthetic capabilities of designing reconfigurable materials via the self-assembly of deformable nanoscale building blocks.<br/><br/>This project will involve graduate students, undergraduate students, and a diverse online community of users in active research via hands-on experiences and research-based courses, workshops, and online computing platforms. The PI will develop a simulation-to-3D-printing workshop and web-based science gateways that will provide a sophisticated, user-friendly environment to engage with the simulations of nanoparticles. These platforms will facilitate access of the educational and research materials to a broad group of students and educators, including those at Minority-Serving Institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

High biodiversity is often associated with a division of resources that allows many types of organisms to coexist with minimal competition. Indeed, unlike many other organisms on coral reefs, sponges are adapted to efficiently remove bacteria, phytoplankton, and dissolved organic matter from seawater by filter-feeding. Sponges are a dominant component of coral reefs worldwide and in the Caribbean, where their biomass exceeds that of reef-building corals. For almost a quarter century, the success of sponges in the Caribbean has been linked to their filter-feeding ability. However, recent work demonstrated that coexisting sponges on Caribbean reefs host unique communities of bacteria that might allow sponges to access multiple pools of nutrients that are not available to other organisms. In this project, the investigators will test the hypothesis that ecologically dominant sponge species in the Caribbean have unique metabolic strategies that are mediated by their associations with microbes that live within the sponge body. This research will combine manipulative field experiments with a novel combination of modern analytical tools to investigate both filter-feeding by sponge hosts and the metabolic pathways of their microbes.  This work will advance our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary forces that have helped shape the species present on Caribbean coral reefs. Additionally, this project will support three early-career investigators and provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at Nova Southeastern University, Appalachian State University, Stony Brook University, and Smithsonian Marine Station. The investigators will also develop innovative outreach programs that expand existing platforms at their institutions to increase public engagement and scientific literacy. <br/><br/>Marine sponges have been widely successful in their expansion across ecological niches in the Caribbean, with biomass often exceeding that of reef-building corals and high species diversity.  However, whether this success is linked to efficient heterotrophic filter-feeding on organic carbon in the water column or to their evolutionary investment in microbial symbionts is yet to be fully elucidated. Microbial symbionts expand the metabolic capabilities of host sponges, supplementing heterotrophic feeding with inorganic carbon and nitrogen, mediating the assimilation of dissolved organic matter, and facilitating recycling of host-derived nitrogen.  Despite these benefits, microbial symbiont communities are widely divergent across coexisting sponge species and there is substantial variation in host reliance on symbiont-derived carbon and nitrogen among host sponges; therefore, these associations likely mediate the ecological diversification of coexisting sponge species. The goal of this project is to test this transformative hypothesis by adopting an integrative approach to assess the individual components of holobiont metabolism (i.e., microbial symbionts and sponge host) in ten of the most common sponge species in the Caribbean. The investigators will isolate autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolic pathways and explore potential links between microbial symbiont community composition and the assimilation of particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM) from seawater. This project will elucidate whether Caribbean sponge species are on similar or divergent evolutionary trajectories, and will provide information that is critical for our understanding of how conditions in the Caribbean basin have shaped the evolution of benthic organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sometimes attendees have trouble staying focused, or else one individual dominates the conversation; in both cases, productivity is down.  The ability to conduct a meeting and foster effective participation by all is influenced by subjective and unquantifiable factors such as relationship dynamics, gender biases, and willingness to accept criticism.  This research will explore whether it may be possible to avoid these complications by using an impersonal entity - the computer - to conduct group meetings and provide both live and post-meeting feedback that enables participants to stay on topic, take part equally, and listen closely to one another, all while generating analytics about the process.  The framework that will be developed in this research may serve as a tool for improving meeting efficiency and effectiveness, while opening up the possibility of designing interventions for individuals with Asperger syndrome or social phobia who find it difficult to assert themselves in group settings.  Providing live feedback during a meeting will require real-time recognition and analysis of the sensed data, but live feedback is only valuable when its interpretation does not impose a cognitive overload on the participants. This research will make contributions on designing live feedback that is effective yet not distractive.  Project findings will also be applicable in the context of online learning, where a computer facilitator could engage every student equally.  In addition to standardized test scores, computers can also create objective analytics on, for example, students' ability to ask questions, participate effectively and maintain a positive attitude.  Recognizing students for their effort may positively impact their scores.  Project findings may help virtual assistants (such as Alexa or Google Home) mediate conversations with appropriate and respectful intervention strategies, and in addition they may yield insights into the role played by gender and racial diversity in improving team performance.  <br/><br/>The interplay of human behaviors (e.g., facial expression, tone of voice, language, interruptions, participation rates, and turn-taking) is considered subtle, sometimes contradictory, and often confusing.  These behaviors can be highly individual-specific, and may require temporal modeling with real-time performance if they are to be harnessed automatically for effective meeting mediation.  While the raw sensed numbers are useful when developing algorithm benchmarks, they add very little value for users.  This research will use principles of human centric computing to visualize, interpret and reveal insights from raw behavioral data.  In particular, the following research questions will be addressed using human-centric approaches in the context of online video conferencing: 1) What possible mediation strategies exist that avoid being disruptive and disrespectful to human participants; 2) Which is most helpful: live feedback, post-meeting feedback, a combination of both, or no feedback at all; 3) Can we implement an automated process to facilitate meeting productivity; and 4) Does feedback improve group performance in any measurable way?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One group of bacteria, ammonia oxidizing bacteria, oxidize ammonium to nitrite and thus play a key role in the removal of ammonium from human derived urea in wastewater treatment plants. In nature, diverse microorganisms coexist and interact in complex ways. Communities of different microorganisms can perform vital functions more efficiently than single species achieve alone. Ammonia oxidizing bacteria are one example, where ammonia is converted more efficiently when in a microbial community than when the oxidizing bacteria are alone. Yet, the interactions among microbial neighbors that improve ammonia conversion are not well understood. The goal of this project is to better understand how living in microbial communities improves ammonia oxidizing bacteria's ability to convert ammonia. An additional goal of this project is to educate a diverse group of students on the importance of microbial communities, and to raise awareness and urgency about water quality. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in state of the art microbiology techniques and involved in the research. Elementary school students from rural Ohio and undergraduate non-microbiology majors will be taught about the importance of microbial communities, nitrification, and water quality. This research will provide important insight into synergistic interactions within bacterial communities and increase the ability to manipulate microbial communities for improved or desired function, such as those in wastewater plants to improve ammonia removal.<br/><br/>Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) oxidize ammonia to nitrite. AOB are core contributors to nitrification, a crucial step in the global nitrogen cycle. As part of microbial communities, AOB positively interact with nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria. It has already been shown that the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria keep the level of toxic nitrite around AOB low, maintaining a beneficial environment that allows for AOB growth. The mechanisms underlying the positive interactions of AOB with heterotrophic bacteria have not been elucidated. These positive interactions will be investigated in well-defined laboratory co-cultures, enrichment cultures, and native environments. Experiments will include (1) proteome and transcriptome analysis of the AOB Nitrosomonas sp. Is79 in the presence of heterotrophic bacteria as single and mixed cultures; (2) proteome analysis of three additional AOB strains in the presence of heterotrophic bacteria; and (3) proteome analysis of an AOB incubated in their original environment. The results will be analyzed to identify strain-specific physiological responses in order to determine the nature of the interactions between AOB and heterotrophic bacteria. Insights into the molecular mechanisms and metabolic pathways in AOB that are impacted by heterotrophic bacteria will add to the growing field of research on autotrophic-heterotrophic interactions. This research will also address the physiological similarities and differences in AOB grown in laboratory pure cultures, in laboratory enrichment cultures, and in their original environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In an effort to improve energy efficiency and performance of existing microelectronics, semiconductors with strong magnetic responses, or ferromagnetic semiconductors, have been recognized as a possible alternative to current non-magnetic semiconductors. This project addresses the challenge of identifying and developing a new class of ferromagnetic semiconductors to enable improvements in energy efficiency and performance. One class of promising ferromagnetic semiconductors is based on a class of oxide thin films based on Sn, known as perovskite stannates. The research involves the design, synthesis, and characterization of stannate thin films with strong magnetic response. Additional research activities include the training of undergraduate and graduate researchers, including underrepresented minorities, who are likely to find future employment in the information technology sector. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This integrated research and education program is focused on the development of a new class of spin-polarized semiconductors in epitaxial stannate oxide thin films through incorporation of magnetic dopants. Research activities include unique approaches to magnetic doping, including incorporating concentrations of magnetic dopants beyond the solubility limits at thermal equilibrium and co-doping on both types of cation sites. This research is timely as it exploits the recent development of high mobility epitaxial stannate films and it may provide an avenue to a room temperature ferromagnetic semiconductor that could make spin-based semiconductor electronics a reality and may revolutionize the microelectronics industry.

Deregulation of gene expression is a hallmark of the human tumor cells. Post-transcriptional regulation is a pervasive mechanism in the relation of most human genes; its implication in cancer is only beginning to be appreciated. The central hypothesis underlying this project is that by considering post-transcriptional regulation events, estimated protein expressions can provide more accurate molecular signatures to detect complex disease mechanisms, compared to mRNA expressions. This project will study post-transcriptional regulation, with the goal of generating computational methods to predict the changes of protein expression level without doing large-scale proteomics experiments. The outcomes of the proposed research will lower the barriers for interacting with analyzing high-dimensional genomic profiles and cut time and costs spent on biomedical research. The new methods will enable biologists and biomedical researchers to perform comprehensive analysis with high-throughput sequencing data and biological networks together to investigate the impact of post-transcriptional regulation in certain cancer types.<br/><br/>This project to use a variety of sequences modalities has three phases: 1) Develop advanced machine learning methods to identify the genome-wide alternative polyadenylation (APA) events in the 3' untranslated region (3'UTR) of the mRNAs between cancer patients and matched normal samples with RNA-Seq data. 2) Develop biologically motivated graph-based learning models and efficient scalable algorithms to estimate the protein expression levels with microRNA-mRNA interaction networks and 3'UTR-APA events. 3) Investigate the prognostic power of the identified APA and estimated protein expressions compared to the canonical genomic features such as mRNA expression, mutation, and copy number variations.

However, individuals with whole-arm paralysis typically do not receive much benefit from these types of neuroprotheses because the devices are not yet capable of replicating the complexity and range of motion of human arm movements. Additionally, the devices must be regularly ""tuned"" by experts to meet the wearer's changing needs. Thus, there is a significant need to develop FES neuroprostheses capabilities for use by people with whole-arm paralysis. This study will create ways to coordinate electrical stimulation of the wearer's shoulder and arm muscles with control of reaching movements.  It will also create a way for a non-expert to update control to respond to changes in the user's muscles and desired movements. The study will test the hypothesis that models of muscle response to electrical stimulation, specific to each wearer, can be learned by the neuroprosthesis and used to coordinate muscles to perform reaching movements. A secondary hypothesis that will be tested is that a caregiver can apply physical cues at the patient's forearm, ""teaching"" the neuroprothesis to refine and expand reaching movements. Research and education are integrated in the project through the creation of an empathy training program for aspiring rehabilitation engineers. Engineering students, alongside medical, therapy, social work, and nursing students, will visit the homes of people with disabilities. Through these home visits and classroom instruction, engineers will develop empathetic skills like affective sharing, self- and other-awareness, perspective taking, and emotional regulation.<br/><br/>The PI's long-term career goal is to create easily usable and widely available neuroprostheses to restore arm function to people with high tetraplegia. Toward this goal, the research objectives for this project are to: (1) create an architecture to control whole-arm reaching motions with FES that retains the arm's natural kinematic and force-producing flexibility and (2) empower a non-expert to easily improve and expand the capabilities of an FES neuroprosthesis. Experiments will address the question of how to control a multi-joint system where the direction of muscle action is state dependent. The PI will gather force and motion data during stimulation of muscles and apply the data to plan achievable hand motions, predict shoulder and elbow torques required to move the arm, and choose muscle stimulation commands to produce those torques. Additionally, the PI will investigate approaches to train the FES controller based on intuitive human intervention. Caregivers will apply manual corrections to the patient's forearm to adjust the system's control policy and refine inaccurate movements.

It builds upon previous work at the University of Rochester to develop teacher leaders.  It also takes advantage of a newly formed Consortium of the University of Rochester and several school districts in upstate New York, that are working together toward district-wide digital conversion.  The project will develop a group of teacher leaders, known as Master Teaching Fellows, to guide district-wide digital conversion efforts in high-need school districts.  Digital conversion is a comprehensive process that that provides each student with a tablet or laptop computer and uses these computers to enhance student learning.  Each Fellow will engage in a five-year program involving 41 credit hours of graduate coursework accompanied by related mentored experiences.  Completion of this program will lead to an Advanced Certificate in Digitally-Rich Teaching in K-12 Schools, which is approved by the New York State Education Department.  In addition, the Master Teaching Fellows will receive annual salary supplements, as they persist as classroom teachers who demonstrate effective use of digital resources.  Through its project evaluation, the project will generate knowledge about how to prepare teacher leaders who can support implementation of high-quality, technology-enriched STEM instruction by others.<br/><br/>Twenty experienced and exemplary mathematics and science teachers with master's degrees will be recruited from six high-need, small school districts (including three primarily rural districts) that are members of the Western New York Digital Conversion Consortium.  This project will capitalize on the long-standing partnership established in previous Master Teaching Fellow projects between the University of Rochester (through its Warner School of Education and STEM departments), the Geneva City School District, the Newark Central School District, and the non-profit Rochester Museum & Science Center.  It will also add new partners: East Irondequoit Central School District, a local pioneer in digital conversion, and three additional high-need rural districts from the Consortium (Dansville, Penn Yan, and Auburn).  With more rigorous learning standards and the challenge of integrating new technology with instruction, it is imperative that researchers and practitioners collaborate to develop deep understanding of what is needed to achieve the full potential of digitally-rich teaching to improve student achievement, especially in STEM.  This project will contribute evidence to the STEM education community about preparation of STEM teacher leaders to integrate digital resources into instruction, to lead their districts in digital conversion efforts, and to use technology to improve STEM instruction and increase student engagement.  This program for the preparation of ""digitally-rich STEM master teachers"" has the potential to serve as a replicable model by other universities in the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Adjacent binding sites in the DNA interact with the multiprotein complex for efficient binding. Yet, both protein domains and clusters of binding sites are encoded as one-dimensional arrays in the genome. This project tests the hypothesis that, in order for specific and correct interactions to occur, there are optimal distances between these functional units and that they are maintained across evolutionary time. Since insertions and deletions of DNA (indels) change the distance between these functional units, the genome will be under evolutionary constraint against indel mutations that affect the distance. To test this hypothesis, the investigator will develop software to systematically estimate and compare the changes in distance between functional elements and statistical models to test the likelihood of the events observed. Upon project completion, the scientific community will have tools that identify distances that are conserved, and will be able to predict the effect and importance of indel mutations occurring in these genomic regions. The investigator will hold workshops for girls in grades 6-12 to develop software games that model the concept of evolutionary constraint. She will also develop undergraduate and graduate classes with hands-on activities on molecular evolution and computational sequence analysis.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to utilize the variation in rates of indels to infer the evolutionary constraint on the distance between functional elements in the genome. Experimental evidence has been accumulating on selection against indels in the loops and linkers within proteins, or in the space between binding sites of regulatory elements. But, studies on the evolution of these sequences are almost nonexistent, due to the difficulty in aligning these sequences. This project addresses these challenges by applying methods that can model variable indel rates across sites or methods that model length instead of relying on alignments. Using these methods, the investigator will produce phylogenetic, and quantitative estimates of indel rates on a significant proportion of the genome that has been neglected so far. In Objective 1, using a new software the investigator has developed, variable site-specific indel rates will be estimated across loops between protein motifs to identify structural motifs with strong constraints on their distance. In Objective 2, the investigator will develop a new software based on birth-death processes to estimate indel rates without relying on alignments. Using this software, she will test the hypothesis that there is stronger constraint on the distance between tandem homologous domains, compared to non-homologous domains. In Objective 3, the investigator will use the software described above to test the hypothesis that there is stronger constraint on the distance between binding sites of homodimers, compared to the distance between binding sites of heterodimers. This study will integrate the knowledge gained in the fields of structural biology and developmental biology into a phylogenomic context, and provide tools for the community to test specific evolutionary hypotheses on distance between functional elements of interest.

However, attentional demands are high on such teams, raising questions of how to both monitor those attentional demands and develop systems that adaptively provide needed information not just through visual displays that are often overloaded, but through other senses including touch and sound.  Most existing work on adaptive multimodal interfaces for situational awareness focuses on individuals; this project will address how to do this work for teams, using unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) search and rescue as its primary domain.  This includes developing conceptual models that connect individual and team-level situational awareness, algorithms that use eye gaze data to assess both situational awareness and workload in real-time, and multimodal display guidelines that adaptively present information to the most appropriate team members through the most effective modes.  This work will fundamentally advance research on understanding and designing to support team interaction, leading to practical improvements in a variety of safety-critical domains.  The project also has a significant educational component, providing research opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students and conducting design activities aimed at outreach and broadening participation in STEM disciplines, including workstation design to support teams of people with disabilities in manufacturing contexts.<br/><br/>The research work has two main thrusts.  The first involves collecting baseline data through a study where pairs of novices are trained to carry out simulated UAV search and rescue tasks using a standard visually-focused interface; the team will collect situational awareness (SA) assessments using existing validated surveys, eye gaze data, and team interaction data and member characteristics.  This data will be used to build two main models.  The first is a model that relates team dynamics and individual member characteristics with levels of SA and performance, using qualitative analysis of recorded observational and audio data, along with focus group interviews with participants.  The second is a quantitative model that attempts to predict SA using eye gaze data, using both a factor analysis of eye gaze data and Markovian models of how teams and their members transition their visual attention between interface elements and tasks to predict levels of SA.  These models will support unobtrusive assessments of SA that avoid the interruptions imposed by existing surveys and are necessary for developing the adaptive multimodal interfaces that are the other main thrust of the project.  This second thrust will use the models of attention and problematic tasks and contexts identified in the first study to iteratively develop a pilot suite of multimodal interfaces that combine visual, audio, and tactile information channels.  These multimodal interfaces will be evaluated using a series of studies similar to the first set, with the goal of developing cost-benefit models for presentation modes and types of information that minimally interfere with teams' existing visual workload while still providing information that raises individual and team SA.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

College is often thought to be the great equalizer because it promotes upward mobility.  But the expansion of higher education may not ensure equal opportunity for everyone, especially when a growing number of people are acquiring an advanced degree. This project will study why the influence of family background becomes stronger among advanced degree holders while it is still weak among those with a BA/BS degree only. This study evaluates three explanations by studying the income levels of those with at least a BA/BS degree.  These people may:  1) attain a highly-lucrative advanced degree such as an MBA or professional degree (vertical selection); 2) major in a non-vocational field of study at the undergraduate level and a profitable one at the graduate level, including health, law, and business (horizontal selection); or 3) complete education at an earlier age and have more years of work experience (cumulative advantage). The project will provide implications for families and educators concerned with the relative tradeoffs for investment in various types of higher education.  The project will also provide implications for states and U.S. society generally in creating policies aimed at promoting useful educational investment.  <br/><br/>This project will analyze income returns to education for adults who achieve various levels of higher education.    The project will analyze over 150,000 respondents aged 35-54 from the 2003, 2010, 2013 and 2015 National Survey of College Graduates data and the IPUMS 5% Census data with at least a bachelor?s degree and having a positive income. The project will use log-multiplicative layer effect and multivariate regression models to examine the extent to which vertical selection, horizontal selection, and cumulative advantage explain income level differences.  The project will also study gender differences in these processes as well as how these effects have changed over time.  The project will inform sociological theories concerned with social mobility and the role of social selection into various types of higher education in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such complex network structures often change continuously over time through the observation of events at irregular times, such as networks of social interactions between people via messages, networks of transactions between organizations, and networks of face-to-face interactions between people. This project formulates a range of models of varying complexity for continuously evolving networks to enable robust real-time analysis of these networks in a variety of application settings. Such dynamic network models could be used in many scientific disciplines and in public health applications, including modeling the spread of airborne viruses between people. The project trains new graduate and undergraduate students, including female students from the University of Toledo's ACM-W chapter, in practical data science research involving a variety of data types and sources. The project also results in the development of an open-source Python software package, DyNetworkX, for analyzing dynamic networks along with educational materials on dynamic networks through a series of lectures and hands-on tutorials using the DyNetworkX package.<br/><br/>This project aims to create a range of probabilistic generative models for continuous-time event-based networks that are flexible enough to account for the types of complex structures seen in real network data, including node popularity, community structure, reciprocity, and transitivity. The project also seeks to develop efficient incremental inference algorithms and discrete-time approximations that allow for real-time analysis of extremely large social networks that are rapidly changing over time, such as those seen in online social network data. The proposed range of models allows an analyst to trade off flexibility and scalability depending on the needs of a particular application. Two main applications are targeted: prediction of the spread of infectious disease over networks of physical proximity and real-time summarization and prediction of online social network activity. Deliverable assets of the project include new probabilistic models and inference algorithms, the DyNetworkX open-source software package, and educational materials on dynamic networks.

However, as a consequence of this complexity, machine learning systems essentially act as ""black-boxes"" as far as users are concerned. Thus, it is incredibly difficult to predict what they will do when deployed, understand why they are making the decisions, guarantee their robustness, or broadly speaking, trust their behavior. As these algorithms become an increasing part of our society, our financial systems, our healthcare providers, our scientific advances, and our defense systems, it is crucial to address this challenge. In this work, the PI and his team will develop algorithms that explain why any classifier is making its decisions, without any access to its underlying implementation, in order to make the inner workings understandable to the users. Such explanations make machine learning more transparent, leading to a more robust evaluation pipeline, reduced debugging efforts, and increased ease of use (and of trust) of these complex, black-box systems.<br/><br/>For a decision made by a machine learning classifier, the team will develop methods that accurately characterize the relationship between the input instance and the algorithm's prediction, and present it in an intuitive manner. The primary intuition is to estimate the instance-specific behavior of the predictor by observing the output of the classifier as the input instance is perturbed. The first proposed thrust of this work extends this basic framework by considering rules that define counter-examples, and summarize the behavior over multiple instances, providing detailed and accurate insights into the behavior with minimal effort on the users' part. The second thrust identifies automated ways to learn domain-specific perturbation functions that generate realistic instances to compute the explanations. The team proposes a comprehensive evaluation of these explainers consisting of user experiments in comparing, trusting, and modifying machine learning algorithms, with applications to diverse tasks such as sentiment analysis, machine translation, time series, visual question answering, and object detection.<br/><br/>Due to the many potential applications of this work, both for machine learning practitioners and end-users, dissemination of the results is a key focus, and the team will augment standard channels (such as publications) with novel ones that include open-source software, jargon-free documentation, and interactive tutorials/demonstrations to encourage application of machine learning to novel domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, understanding how protein sequence describes function and structure is a fundamental problem in biological research. Yet, the traditional interpretation of protein sequences is 3ased on either manual identification of sub-sequence patterns or some arbitrary dissection of a sequence into subsequences of fixed size; neither approach can accurately recognize all of the semantic components in a protein sequence that are relevant to its structure and function. In this project, powerful artificial intelligence methods, based on deep learning, will be designed such that they can automatically map protein sequences into high-level semantic features that are meaningful when related to protein structure and function. This will not only improve the accuracy of predicting protein structural and functional properties, but also provide a new way of representing and interpreting proteins biological function, transforming how protein data are interpreted. The impact of the basic research will be broadened through open source software dissemination to other researchers, seminars on deep learning and bioinformatics, student training, involvement of minority and female students, publications, presentations, workshops, and outreach activities for high school students, as well as thoughtfully crafted communication with the Missouri state legislature, and other members of the general public.<br/><br/>During the research, novel deep one-dimensional (1D), 2D, and 3D convolutional neural networks will be developed to translate protein sequences or structures of arbitrary size into high-level features under the guidance of improving the prediction of multiple residue-wise local structural/functional properties (secondary structures, solvent accessibility, torsion angle, disorder, contact map, disulfide bonds, beta-sheet pairings, and protein functional sites) as well as global properties such as folds. The 1D convolutional neural network for interpreting protein sequence data will also be supplemented by the long- and short-term memory networks. The comprehensive deep learning models will be trained by innovative multi-task learning and transfer learning to enhance prediction performance.

In addition to advancing the classic protein prediction tasks through the novel deep learning architectures, the hidden features automatically extracted by the deep learning models will provide a new semantic representation of proteins, which will likely transform various protein bioinformatics tasks such as classification, clustering, comparison, and ranking.

The Valencia College Engineering Technology Supply Chain Automation ATE project located in Central Florida aims to advance research on effective practices in engineering technology (ET) workforce education through a new curriculum framework and innovative approaches to teaching supply chain automation (SCA). The need for the project was driven in consultation with the National Center of Supply Chain Automation and with input from nationally recognized regional employers who reinforced the national and regional labor shortage. The new SCA-specialization will seek to provide a model for community colleges across the country, contributing to a growing movement for businesses and industries to become more efficient in distribution and supply chain automation practices. As the first program offered in the state of Florida, working closely with local business, industry, civic, and government partners, the program plans to attract and graduate a diversity of students, including underrepresented minorities (URMs) and women, to the growing field of supply chain technician jobs. The project is designed to demonstrate that the SCA-specialization within the ET associate degree (A.S.) program is a viable two-year degree option that will serve the community through partnerships with industry, leading to high wage employment opportunities in high-demand occupations, and generating new knowledge on the skills and competencies identified by industry to meet the workforce needs in SCA. Following a rigorous evaluation, Valencia will share best practices, curriculum and insight with other ATE centers and projects and collaborators to add knowledge to benefit the whole. <br/><br/>The project will support building a robust workforce within demographics that will impact the future vitality of the technically-trained workforce. Through a replicable model, the project aims to develop this new SCA-specialization and college certificate and offer rigorous technical courses that will be taught in creative ways, using approaches proven to engage all students. Project objectives are to (1) develop and implement the new specialization within the state ET associate degree curriculum framework; (2) provide professional development for faculty and secondary education teachers aimed at improving instructional practices and learning outcomes, and having faculty obtain industry-recognized credentials; and (3) collaborate with high schools to develop a pathway to the SCA specialization with evidenced-based teaching and learning practices that increase early awareness and exposure to ET pathways for a wide diversity of students. Project deliverables will target (a) increased industry connections, (b) the development of a new SCA-specialization and college certificate, (c) increased secondary education partnerships, (d)  professional development for a minimum of eight high school teachers a year who participate in the SCA trainings to learn best-practices on the engagement of URM and female students in ET pathways, and (e) faculty preparation for a minimum of four faculty who will complete the trainings to be prepared with the necessary skills and credentials to teach the SCA curriculum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will lay the foundation for a future Noyce Teacher Scholarships and Stipends (Track 1) proposal.<br/><br/>The project has three primary goals: (1) gauge the interest of STEM majors in STEM teaching as a profession; (2) improve the perception of STEM students and faculty regarding a teaching career; and (3) increase the number of STEM students pursuing a joint education degree and a degree in a STEM discipline. The project will be driven by two interrelated objectives: (1) determine whether a semester-long after-school teaching experience can attract STEM majors to consider a career in teaching; and (2) identify the root cause(s) of the current low interest in STEM education, so that interventions can be designed. Research approaches include assessment of STEM major interest via the STEM Career Interest Survey (STEM-CIS) taken by all first year SAC STEM majors. Attitudes about urban schools and students will be measured with a pre-/post-questionnaire and an exit interview. The interest in STEM education across campus will be measured with a survey developed by the project team, the ""STEM Faculty Attitudes about Teaching as a Career Survey."" This project will expand the Noyce portfolio by adding the perspective of a small, urban, liberal-arts college and by impacting Manchester, NH, a community with a large refugee population.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This need is driven by the observation that current 4G systems do not provide sufficient information on network behaviors. Consequently, it poses challenges to optimize performance, diagnose failures, and dis-incentivizes deployment of new applications such as virtual and augmented realities (AR/VR), autonomous vehicles, massive Internet of things. This project seeks to enhance intelligence to the 4G/5G signaling subsystem, offering critical network control utilities, such as radio resource control and mobility management. These new designs will lead to improvements in performance and reliability to the mobile Internet infrastructure for our society. The investigator will interact closely with mobile network companies for possible technology transfer. The project will also seek to influence the upcoming 5G and beyond 5G-standardization. It will recruit and train a new generation of engineers and students, including those from groups under-represented in this area.<br/><br/>This project explores a novel approach of Amplifying Intelligence in Mobile networked systems (called AIM). AIM will tackle two challenges: (1) lack of knowledge at the mobile clients: The mobile operating system and application programs lack information on the underlying ""black-box"" network operations; (2) High complexity and lack of verification in the infrastructure: The infrastructure suffers from complex designs and operations without proper verification. AIM is a multi-disciplinary solution that applies machine learning, data science, distributed systems and computing theory to mobile networking. Through its data-driven and verifiable design, AIM offers a viable, new solution suite in four concrete technical thrusts: (T1) protocol and function analytics for data-driven clients; (T2) provable and simplified control-plane signaling for data access; (T3) enhanced error-handling design with new investigative capability of tracing; and (T4) mobile VR for data-plane signaling intelligence.

The Fourier transform decomposes a function of time into different frequency components, similarly to how a music chord can be expressed as the pitches of its constituent notes. Harmonic analysis studies how the time information and the frequency information interact with each other. A fundamental question (i.e. Fourier restriction problem) that has been studied for decades is how the geometry of the frequency support of the Fourier transform dictates the size of the original function in time. Various quantifications of such relations are referred to as Fourier restriction estimates and turn out to be extremely challenging to study. Even for the simplest geometric objects such as spheres and paraboloids, many questions are still wide open. Restriction estimates are interesting also due to their connection with many other problems, within or outside analysis. It is well known that restriction estimates can be applied to study the Kakeya conjecture (on the minimum area of a set containing a unit line segment in each direction), the existence and growth of solutions to Schrödinger and wave equations, and the number of solutions to Diophantine equations in number theory.<br/><br/>This project studies several problems related to Fourier restriction estimates. First, the principal investigator intends to further the investigation of the Fourier restriction conjecture for the paraboloid and the cone via the polynomial method. This method explores the algebraic structure of the time-frequency decomposition of the function, and has shown to be extremely powerful in obtaining many state-of-the-art results in the theory. Second, the principal investigator proposes to continue the study of weighted restriction estimates (i.e. when the Lebesgue measure is replaced with a fractal measure) and apply them to estimate divergence sets of the Schrödinger or wave equations and to distance set problems (on how the size of a set dictates the size of its distance set). The major difficulty in this direction is the lack of a crucial tool (orthogonality) caused by the presence of the fractal measure. Here an interesting approach will attack the distance set problems directly by studying the behavior of the fractal measure. Last, the principal investigator wants to explore the role in restriction theory of a recently developed tool called sparse domination. This method, arising from singular integral theory, is a way to reduce the study of the original continuous, spread out operator to that of a class of much simpler dyadic, positive, local operators. This method has shown to be extremely useful in singular integral theory and has become a modern view of point in describing operators. The principal investigator plans to further the study of sparse bounds of operators related to restriction estimates and with a Kakeya nature, such as the Bochner-Riesz multipliers, singular integrals along manifolds, directional maximal operators, and multi-parameter singular integral operators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analytic number theory is a branch of number theory which uses tools from mathematical analysis to solve problems about the integers. Harmonic analysis has its roots in the work of Fourier, who studied the way general functions may be represented by sums of simpler trigonometric functions. It has applications in various areas including mathematical physics, signal processing, and digital image processing. The project involves a series of problems in harmonic analysis related to Radon transforms and X-ray transforms. A deeper understanding of these transforms will produce a number of applications in areas such as computed tomography (CT) scan, sonar techniques, and radar techniques. On the other hand, the proposed project will stimulate interactions between harmonic analysis and analytic number theory. The principal investigator proposes to study a few famous open problems in analytic number theory, via tools recently developed in harmonic analysis. <br/><br/>The project involves work in three directions, focusing separately on decoupling theory, time-frequency analysis, and certain oscillatory integrals that connect the previous two topics. One problem that is proposed in decoupling theory concerns Parsell-Vinogradov systems in all dimensions. The goal is to establish certain sharp decoupling inequalities that would imply sharp upper bounds on the number of integer solutions of these systems. Progress on this problem will allow a representation of every polynomial of a given degree by fewer linear forms. In the direction of time-frequency analysis, the principal investigator proposes to study an important special case of the famous Zygmund conjecture. This conjecture states that the maximal operator associated with a planar Lipschitz vector field is weakly bounded on the space of square-integrable functions. The principal investigator proposes to study the conjecture by further assuming the vector field to be constant along each vertical line on the plane. One problem that is proposed in the area of oscillatory integrals aims at proving sharp Sobolev regularity estimates for an averaging operator along the moment curve in every dimension. Sharp decoupling inequalities established by the principal investigator and collaborator will provide necessary tools from decoupling theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, Boise State University will collaborate with Caldwell, Jerome, Kimberly, Kuna, and Vallivue school districts to identify, recruit, and then support students interested in pursuing STEM teaching careers. During students' first two years of study, opportunities for support include an on-campus Living and Learning Community and STEM education summer internships in students' home communities. Students will complete Boise State University's four-year BS/certification program for the STEM disciplines (IDoTeach). In addition to scholarship support in their last two years of study, the project will support their transition into STEM teaching careers with an induction program that prepares new teachers to be teacher-leaders. This project aims to prepare teachers to enter the profession with knowledge of the systemic barriers that limit equitable instruction for a range of students, so that they are better advocate for the interests and needs of their increasingly diverse communities.<br/><br/>This proposal's merits lie in its efforts to increase the number and quality of STEM teachers for Idaho's secondary schools.  Concomitant with these efforts is the goal to identify mechanisms that support an increase in the number of teachers, particularly with respect to the needs of rural, isolated districts. The theory of action behind this proposal is that explicit attention to students' geography in recruitment, internship placement, preparation, and ongoing support will close a loop: Students will be recruited from, prepared to teach within, and ultimately hired to serve as STEM educators for their rural home communities. Program evaluation will identify features of the recruitment, preparation and retention efforts that impact the number of teachers in rural school districts.

This very paradoxical behavior underlies the theory of thermodynamics in physics, in which complicated systems of particles admit a simpler global description (involving just a few variables, such as pressure and temperature) when the number of particles becomes large.  A mathematical theory of free probability, initiated by Voiculescu in the 1980s, has shown that von Neumann algebras can be viewed as systems of 'thermodynamic variables' for asymptotic behavior of random matrices. A distinctive feature of the theory is that the variables no longer commute: the order of their multiplication matters.  This results in an extremely rich theory that leads to free probability generalizations of classical objects such as partial differential equations, Brownian motion, and so on. The present project concerns questions of better understanding of asymptotic behavior of random matrices and of the resulting asymptotic limit through construction of invariants, which are both algebraic and analytic in nature. <br/><br/>The project's aim is to continue the study of cohomological invariants associated to subfactors and more general inclusions of algebras, in particular L^2 invariants and their analogs. The study of some of these invariants turns out to involve many analytical tools supplied by free probability theory, such as free probability analogs of Brownian motion and of the associated Laplace-like operators. The study of these operators - arising in the asymptotic limit of random matrices - is of significant interest in random matrix theory as well.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wind-resistant design of buildings plays an important role in securing the nation's welfare and prosperity through reduced building damage, fatalities, societal disruptions, and business discontinuities during these extreme events. Considerable challenges arise as an increasingly large portion of the nation's building inventory is located in urban environments with exposure to extreme wind events. Interference effects, caused by interactions between different building geometries, can increase the local wind speed on buildings by 50% or more compared to the undisturbed atmospheric boundary layer wind speed. Routine calculations for design wind loads do not account for these interference effects and, therefore, significantly can underestimate the wind loading on buildings and result in inadequate building design. The goal of this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award is to advance fundamental understanding of wind flow phenomena for the design of resilient and sustainable buildings and urban environments through establishment of computational frameworks that can quantify and, where possible, reduce the uncertainty in computational predictions of these phenomena. The capability to make well-informed decisions based on computational predictions and uncertainty quantification will lead to optimized designs for more wind-resilient and, thus, safer buildings and cities. High school, undergraduate, and graduate students and high school teachers will participate in the research program.  The experimental and numerical data sets resulting from this research will be leveraged to establish active learning modules for wind engineering for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. Workshops held during years two and five of the award will support the education of a diverse community of engineers to understand the complexity of urban flow and wind loading phenomena and the strengths and weaknesses of computational models, wind tunnel tests, and field experiments. The research will use the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Wall of Wind facility at Florida International University and archive project data in the NHERI Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). <br/><br/>This research will establish computational models to quantify the influence of the surrounding built environment on the local wind speed and turbulence and the resulting interference effects on the wind loads on buildings in urban environments.  The research plan will involve a comprehensive program of field measurements, wind tunnel tests, and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations with uncertainty quantification and data assimilation. The Engineering Quad on Stanford's campus, which is representative of an urban environment, will serve as a test bed for implementing the research plan. Rather than pursuing a traditional deterministic investigation, novel stochastic methods will be explored to enable comparison of experimental and numerical results with confidence intervals.  Specific focus of the research will be on: (1) using data assimilation algorithms to reduce uncertainty related to the inflow boundary conditions, (2) systematic quantification of the effect of geometrical simplifications, and (3) using multi-fidelity algorithms to reduce turbulence model form uncertainties. The research results will provide essential new information on the fitness-for-purpose and integration of models with different levels of fidelity and will indicate the potential of leveraging urban sensor networks to improve the accuracy of the predictions. The research program will result in a fundamentally improved understanding of interference effects and enable considerable advances in CFD modeling for urban flow and wind loading. More broadly, the novel computational strategies resulting from this research will benefit other sustainable urban design problems influenced by wind, such as street canyon and building ventilation, outdoor and indoor air quality, harvesting renewable energy resources, and urban planning for heat island mitigation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

GIS combines cartography, spatial analysis, and data management to support research and inform decision-making. Computer programmers or database administrators need GIS expertise to maintain or program databases containing geographic information. Mapping technicians apply GIS concepts when creating maps and charts. GIS is also used in city planning, developing marketing strategies, addressing public health concerns, and conducting geographic research. The use of GIS in many fields opens new employment options for students. Despite these employment needs, only four GIS certificates were awarded in the South-Central Coast Region of California between 2012-2015, all by a single community college that is 200 miles from San Luis Obispo, where Cuesta College is located. Since adequate GIS training is not currently available in the region served by Cuesta College, this project aims to meet the high-demand workforce needs across multiple industry sectors for Geographic Information System (GIS) Technicians.<br/><br/>This project establishes a GIS Analyst certificate at Cuesta College, a Hispanic-Serving Institution. Activities include outreach, and project-based and work-based learning designed to motivate more students to enroll in specialized GIS courses.  This increased enrollment is expected to increase the number of students, particularly Hispanic students, who earn a GIS Analyst certificate. The certificate will be part of the Earth and Ocean Science program but may appeal to students who seek to add GIS skills to other degrees, such as engineering or computer information systems.  Through seminars related to use of GIS in these and other fields, the project aims to engage faculty from different fields in the GIS project. The GIS Analyst certificate is also expected to appeal to workers who need to learn GIS skills to advance in their careers or to become competitive for a new job. The GIS Analyst certificate requires the addition of three new courses, which will be based on models developed by the GeoTech Center with funding from the National Science Foundation. Regional employers will contribute to the development of the curriculum and provide work experiences for students. Students enrolled in GIS courses will have the opportunity to attend the Environmental Systems Research Institute Users Conference, earn industry-recognized credentials, and display their projects at a local GIS event.

Driven by environmental and economic considerations, there is rapid innovation in the industry, but the next generation of HHC compounds raise fire safety concerns. Predicting the combustion behavior of these novel HHCs earlier in the design process will save much time, effort, and expense. The chemical kinetic models for describing HHC combustion are highly complex, comprising thousands of elementary reactions involving hundreds of chemical species. To effectively predict these combustion behaviors, we must automate the construction of kinetic models. This project will use a computational approach known as machine learning to help model these complex reacting systems. This breakthrough will enable us to develop an automated reaction mechanism generation tool to create detailed kinetic models for combustion of HHCs. The methodology proposed in this work are not only novel and necessary, but will be widely applicable in other aspects of automated mechanism generation. The integrated educational objective of this CAREER project is to develop a series of computational modules teaching students to solve problems throughout their chemical engineering curriculum.<br/><br/>The research approach is to extend and apply automated Reaction Mechanism Generator (RMG) software to create detailed kinetic models for combustion of any mix of hydrocarbons containing any combination of halogen atoms. Optimized decision-tree and novel convolutional neural network algorithms from the field of machine learning will be extended to enable the necessary restructuring of parameter estimation codes. Quantum chemistry calculations will be automated to supplement literature searches to generate the necessary training data. The model-generating tool will be validated against available experimental data from key example compounds, and used to explain the remarkable combustion behavior of these compounds. The educational program is aligned with the research, developing a series of computational modules that will be integrated into existing classes. These modules will teach students to use Python and SciPy to solve chemical engineering problems. The integration of teaching modules for scientific computing throughout the undergraduate chemical engineering curriculum will help prepare a generation of graduate engineers for a workplace in which data analysis, processing, and computation are increasingly important.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even when it is possible to design a robotic system to complete such a task, the resulting system can be too costly and/or lack the robustness required for industrial use. For example, produce picking remains a labor-intensive endeavor for the agriculture industry because variability in the operating environment and fragility of the produce have thus far prevented the design of an economical mechanized solution. Other examples can be found in numerous industries, including semiconductor manufacturing, healthcare and biomedical engineering. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award supports fundamental research to advance mechanical systems design in this setting. The research will lead to a new geometric design methodology that results in robust mechanical systems and motion paths for uncertain operating environments and manipulating uncertain objects. Research outcomes will advance national health and prosperity by impacting industries such as manufacturing, agriculture and healthcare. An innovative educational program will create a cross-disciplinary research-oriented course for lower division undergraduates at a Minority Serving Institution, engage female high school students through a robotics-themed summer program and develop activities to facilitate the transfer of underrepresented community college students to four-year engineering degrees.<br/><br/>This CAREER award applies robust geometric design principals to mechanical systems to explain complex motion in mechanism-object/environment interaction and uncertainty: two critical foci not explicitly captured in existing design methodologies. In this context, uncertainty refers to variations in the object/environment geometry and/or in the realizable mechanism motion paths. The results will yield a novel framework for the design of mechanisms for interaction with uncertain objects/environments. This will be accomplished through a general mechanism-environment contact geometric model formulation and its validation. The design framework will be assessed through designing and experimentally testing industry-related showcase prototypes in the areas of mechanical and biomedical engineering. The central hypothesis is that incorporating mechanism-environment interaction and uncertainty conditions into the design task formulation results in a robust design methodology that is better than existing approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many natural materials have geometrical microstructures which make them stronger and tougher than their base materials.  This research will provide the needed knowledge so that these mechanisms can be incorporated in soils using additive manufacturing (i.e. 3D printing) techniques in which soils are ""printed"" into structural components or cellular patterns to improve their load carrying ability.  Bio-inspired structures like the honeycomb have been studied for metals and other solid materials; however, an understanding of the effectiveness of these load transfer mechanisms in particulate materials like soils is lacking.  Improving a soil's ability to carry load will result in more sustainable and cost-effective geotechnical practice by reducing the amounts of concrete and other materials needed for a project.  The fundamental understanding gained in this project will also move additive manufacturing further towards becoming a viable option for building shelters and other infrastructure in remote and underdeveloped locations, and in disaster relief or war-torn areas.  Additionally, this project seeks to promote interdisciplinary education through a new course and the participation and retention of diverse students through activities such as K-12 outreach focused on exploring engineering principles in nature, visual-spatial workshops, and recruitment of high quality researchers through the University's Engineering Career Awareness Program. <br/><br/>Hierarchical microstructures give many natural materials strengths which are orders of magnitude greater than their constituents.

Therefore, this grant focuses on:  (1) understanding the optimized load carrying mechanisms in nature and mimicking these mechanisms in soils; (2) evaluating the behaviors of bio-inspired soils across the length scales using experimental testing and discrete element method (DEM) modeling; and, (3) investigating additive manufacturing as a means to construct cellular soil fabrics and infrastructure at the field-scale.  In addition to the DEM simulations, a topology-based method for optimizing the patterns for a given loading scenario and capturing the resulting behavior is necessary to provide a solution for the many possible geotechnical applications.

The desired level of access to particular capabilities, such as ordering items using a shared voice assistant, likely differs across members of a household (e.g., children and parents). Widely deployed devices and the existing research literature lack mechanisms for specifying who should be able to perform which actions with which household Internet-connected devices. Complicating matters, the users of a given device often have complex social relationships to each other. Our goal is to develop techniques and interfaces that enable non-technical users to specify who should be able to perform what actions using which Internet-connected devices in the home, as well as to verify the identity of the person trying to perform those actions. Misconfigured devices can open the home to attackers, yet may also disenfranchise members of the household.

Failure of structural materials by fatigue -- the accumulation of damage under cyclic loading -- remains one of the major challenges in mechanics and materials science. Crucially, the mechanisms through which applied mechanical loading distributes between regions called grains within the microstructure are not fully understood. The novelty of the computational approach to be used in this project is to explicitly target the grain boundaries, which will inherently connect multiple scales relevant to fatigue crack nucleation and growth. Knowledge of the correlations between the microstructure and fatigue crack driving forces will enable tailored material design. Recent advances in additive manufacturing technology have enabled control of microstructure during material deposition. This research will yield a theoretical and computational framework for designing structural components to capitalize on this flexible manufacturing technology. Thus, the research will advance national health, prosperity, welfare, and defense, while progressing science. The research outcomes of the project will be integrated with specific K-12 and underrepresented minority outreach activities as well as support foundational research in vectors education. Making physics concepts easier will empower students to succeed and bring new perspectives to their future STEM careers. Curriculum enhancements will directly impact courses at the 11th grade up to graduate level; broader impact is achieved through teaching new pedagogies to educators.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to advance the understanding of microstructural and textural influences on fatigue behavior of polycrystalline materials by understanding how stress applied at the bulk scale is redistributed at the grain scale. The primary research objective is to discover how grain interactions, called the neighborhood effect, influence the distribution of local stresses that drive fatigue crack nucleation and growth. The novel approach involves decomposing the balance of forces and displacement jumps along grain boundaries into contributions from the granular uniform field (mesoscale) and fluctuation field (microscale). A multi-resolution Discontinuous Galerkin method is developed to measure the neighborhood effect that is ideally-suited for capturing discontinuities along grain boundaries, allowing contributions from mesoscale and microscale to be distinguished but not having to be separated. Hypotheses are pursued to reveal the relative zone of influence of mesoscale versus microscale stress components, thereby elevating the empirical nature of fatigue threshold design to account for microstructural and textural features that increase resistance to small crack growth. Insight as to how these local effects propagate through the microstructure and affect material fatigue would provide a better understanding of why some flaws nucleate cracks while others do not. This project launches the PI towards becoming a national leader in the prediction of engineering scale fatigue properties for polycrystalline structural materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the extreme, the accumulation of harmful mutations can lead to population extinction. The genetic information in mitochondria - the main source of energy production in most complex organisms - is usually passed intact from parents to offspring. Thus, the mitochondria should be especially prone to the buildup of harmful mutations. However, mitochondria have maintained their function for more than one billion years; how and why is an important question in evolutionary biology. This research uses a model snail system to address these questions. It takes advantage of the fact that some lineages of snails pass both their nuclear and mitochondrial genomes on to their offspring without any genetic shuffling; a process that accelerates the accumulation of mutations in these snails. By contrast, there is shuffling of genetic material between parents and offspring in other lineages of the same snail species. This project will compare different lineages of snails, some with genetic shuffling and some without. In doing so, this research will explore how harmful mutations are cleared from populations. Reducing the impact of harmful mutations is important for keeping organisms healthy. In turn, healthy organisms can guard against population extinction. It is possible that harmful mutations in the mitochondria are compensated for by mutations in nuclear genes. This hypothesis will also be tested by this research. Because functional mitochondria are important to the health of many organisms, the research will be relevant to the biomedical and agricultural communities. The research will also train a new generation of scientists and broaden participation in biology. The broader impacts include collaborations with high school students and museums. The project will also extend an award-winning partnership with the National Center for Science Education to new audiences.<br/><br/>The research combines genetic and functional methods to test for signatures of mitochondrial-nuclear coevolution in the New Zealand freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. In this snail system, some lineages are sexual and others are asexual. Crucially for this study, the asexual lineages of P. antipodarum have higher mitochondrial substitution rates than the sexual lineages. This contrast in mitochondrial substitution rates permits the study's two objectives. Objective 1 will test the hypothesis that higher mitochondrial substitution rates in asexual versus sexual lineages drive stronger mitochondrial-nuclear molecular coevolutionary dynamics. One prediction of these coevolutionary dynamics is that substitution rates for proteins encoded by the nuclear genome that are then targeted to the mitochondria will be higher than the substitution rates in control nuclear gene sets. Objective 2 will test for functional effects of mitonuclear interactions on mitochondrial respiration and snail metabolic rate. Since temperature can impact snail metabolic rates, the second objective will include four different temperature treatments. Results of this research will contribute to our understanding of the mitochondrial-nuclear interactions that define eukaryotes. Furthermore, they are of broad relevance to genome evolution, speciation, and the functional and evolutionary consequences of reproductive mode variation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One group of bacteria, ammonia oxidizing bacteria, oxidize ammonium to nitrite and thus play a key role in the removal of ammonium from human derived urea in wastewater treatment plants. In nature, diverse microorganisms coexist and interact in complex ways. Communities of different microorganisms can perform vital functions more efficiently than single species achieve alone. Ammonia oxidizing bacteria are one example, where ammonia is converted more efficiently when in a microbial community than when the oxidizing bacteria are alone. Yet, the interactions among microbial neighbors that improve ammonia conversion are not well understood. The goal of this project is to better understand how living in microbial communities improves ammonia oxidizing bacteria's ability to convert ammonia. An additional goal of this project is to educate a diverse group of students on the importance of microbial communities, and to raise awareness and urgency about water quality. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in state of the art microbiology techniques and involved in the research. Elementary school students from rural Ohio and undergraduate non-microbiology majors will be taught about the importance of microbial communities, nitrification, and water quality. This research will provide important insight into synergistic interactions within bacterial communities and increase the ability to manipulate microbial communities for improved or desired function, such as those in wastewater plants to improve ammonia removal.<br/><br/>Ammonia-oxidizing bacteria (AOB) oxidize ammonia to nitrite. AOB are core contributors to nitrification, a crucial step in the global nitrogen cycle. As part of microbial communities, AOB positively interact with nitrite-oxidizing bacteria and heterotrophic bacteria. It has already been shown that the nitrite-oxidizing bacteria keep the level of toxic nitrite around AOB low, maintaining a beneficial environment that allows for AOB growth. The mechanisms underlying the positive interactions of AOB with heterotrophic bacteria have not been elucidated. These positive interactions will be investigated in well-defined laboratory co-cultures, enrichment cultures, and native environments. Experiments will include (1) proteome and transcriptome analysis of the AOB Nitrosomonas sp. Is79 in the presence of heterotrophic bacteria as single and mixed cultures; (2) proteome analysis of three additional AOB strains in the presence of heterotrophic bacteria; and (3) proteome analysis of an AOB incubated in their original environment. The results will be analyzed to identify strain-specific physiological responses in order to determine the nature of the interactions between AOB and heterotrophic bacteria. Insights into the molecular mechanisms and metabolic pathways in AOB that are impacted by heterotrophic bacteria will add to the growing field of research on autotrophic-heterotrophic interactions.

This project is focused on studying the fundamental materials properties for a platform of energy-absorbing polymers and developing a toolbox to introduce molecular mechanisms to increase toughness, energy dissipation, and the potential for nanoscale self-healing that will increase the lifespan of the material. This platform is based on polymer network materials called ""thiol-ene network thermosets"". They can be made through chemistry that offers fast reaction times and highly homogeneous networks, like a chain-link fence, resulting in high energy absorption capacity. Previous work in the Savin group has demonstrated the ability to make molecular-level changes in the network and have this translate into macroscopic changes in the physical properties of the materials.  These changes can be done in a modular way using facile chemistry.  The resulting materials have applications in sound damping, shatterproof coatings, personal protective equipment (e.g., mouthguards and multi-impact foams), and ballistics protection.  Advances in scientific discovery will be incorporated into the education and training of students, integrating a broad range of disciplines including chemistry, physics, biochemistry, and polymer science.  Group members will gain a comprehensive understanding of polymers in many areas of synthesis, characterization, morphology, scattering and rheology, from both a fundamental and an applied standpoint.  This multidisciplinary approach is beneficial not only for education, but also to produce well-rounded graduates who are attractive to a variety of employers in both academic and industrial settings. Diversity and involvement in K-5 elementary science outreach are also strongly emphasized. <br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to study the fundamental materials properties for a platform of energy absorbing polymers based on thiol-ene network (TEN) thermosets. Previous research on TENs has shown the ability to make molecular-level manipulations through chemistry and have this translate to changes in macroscopic performance and function. The goal of this research is to exploit advances in TEN modification to synthesize new monomers where we introduce mechanisms to increase toughness, as well as the potential for self-healing that will ultimately increase the life span of the material. This will be done for both slab (Aim 1) and foam (Aim 2) materials. In the proposed research, we will introduce these molecular-level mechanisms for energy dissipation and toughness through dynamic-covalent sacrificial, mechanochemical linkages, and incorporation of photo-responsive, liquid crystalline azobenzene substituents. Building a toolbox of network modifications will allow us to discover materials that have the potential to transform the field of energy-absorbing materials by expanding functionality. The modified TEN materials platform that will be developed in this proposal is completely modular and can be applied to applications such as personal protective equipment, curable coatings, ballistics protection, dental restoratives, and polymer composite materials. Successful completion of the proposed research will yield a platform of materials with improved impact-energy absorption properties, as well as an understanding of how molecular design and manipulation translates into dynamics and macroscopic function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increasing the number of bilingual and underrepresented STEM teachers may improve student performance as well as lead to a more diverse pool of students graduating from high school, pursuing STEM majors, and either teaching STEM or working in a STEM field. The need for STEM teachers in the areas surrounding Molloy is expected to increase as a large percentage of current teachers approach retirement age. Further, bilingual teachers are in high demand as English Language Learners (ELLs)/Multilingual Learners (MLLs) in Molloy's nearby counties are a steadily growing subpopulation, accounting for 14% of all ELLs/MLLs in the state. The goal of the Noyce Ambassadors Program is to produce newly certified STEM teachers, with two-thirds from underrepresented backgrounds, first-generation college students, and/or bilingual. The Noyce Ambassadors Program will include a variety of activities to recruit high-achieving STEM students and inspire them to become teachers in high needs school districts. Activities include a two-week introductory research boot camp held for one week on Molloy's campus and for one week on Nassau Community College's (NCC) campus. At this research boot camp, students will learn from faculty as well as in-service teachers. Once admitted into the program, the Noyce Ambassadors will participate in two summer internship experiences, one on Molloy's campus and another at Molloy's Center for Environmental Research and Coastal Oceans Monitoring (CERCOM) field station. The CERCOM field station is dedicated to the captive breeding of horseshoe crabs, exploration of global coastal environments and nearshore oceans, and interpretation of these environments through data analysis. These experiences will show the Noyce Ambassadors how to apply and teach STEM concepts in the context of real-life problems. During the academic year, the Noyce Ambassadors will complete an intensive curriculum and school-based field experiences that are tailored to prepare them to be highly effective teachers. Molloy will also provide professional development to support Noyce Ambassadors as they complete their teaching requirements.<br/><br/>The Noyce Ambassadors Program aims to produce 18 new STEM teachers, and will recruit students majoring in mathematics, biology or earth and environmental science. Molloy will collaborate with NCC to recruit high school and community college students. Through this partnership, the project aims to form a pipeline of future STEM students and teachers, as well as potential Noyce Ambassadors. Molloy and NCC will also collaborate with four Local Education Agencies:  Freeport and Uniondale school districts in Nassau County, and Brentwood and Amityville school districts in Suffolk County. These agencies will serve as sites for clinical teaching experiences.

However, the figures studied here are higher, sometimes infinite dimensional, and they are given in terms of equations that involve complex numbers, rather than the real numbers that would occur with curves and surfaces. Even if these high dimensional and complex geometric figures are hard to visualize, as they do not fit in the space we are familiar with, they have proved to be most relevant to the description of our physical world, both on the atomic and subatomic levels (quantum theory), and on the astronomical scale (relativity). A central notion in geometry and its applications is that of curvature. A straight line has zero curvature: in general, curvature measures deviation of figures from straight. The project will explore curvature properties of figures that arise in various contexts, and implications that can be drawn if the curvature is known to be positive or negative.<br/><br/>The project has three parts. The first concerns the space of Kahler metrics on a compact complex manifold, an infinite dimensional space that is known to have non-positive curvature. The goal is to find shortest curves connecting points in this space, symmetries of the space, and investigate how symmetries interact with certain much studied functionals, such as Mabuchi's energy. The second and third parts concern general holomorphic Hilbert or Banach bundles, endowed with metrics. One problem is how curvature properties of the metrics change if the bundle and its metric are subjected to certain transformations. Another is to exploit curvature properties to estimate operators that arise in harmonic and complex analysis, by the technique of extrapolation. The methods will come from complex analysis and geometry, operator theory, and partial differential equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Individuals suffering from incomplete spinal cord injuries may have voluntary control of their limbs, but their strength is weakened compared to able-bodied persons. Neurorehabilitation is a therapeutic approach used to recover limb function in individuals suffering from incomplete spinal cord injury; robotic or electrical stimulation devices encourage repair of the person's nervous system through repeated, assisted exercise. The amount of assistance the device provides is based upon the user's remaining muscle function. However, correctly measuring a person's voluntary effort during therapeutic exercise is a significant technical challenge. Discrepancies in the measurement can cause the robot to provide too much or too little assistance, which can slow recovery and lead to falls during robot-assisted walking. To address the technical challenge of sensing of voluntary effort, this project will integrate ultrasound imaging with electromyography-based (i.e., electrical signals) measurement of ankle muscles that govern walking. The use of ultrasound imaging will allow direct visualization and measurement of muscle activity and minimizes interference of electrical signals from neighboring muscles. Ultrasound imaging will also be investigated as an approach for optimizing electrode placement to initiate multi-plane ankle movements. The study will test the hypothesis that ultrasound imaging-based measurement of voluntary effort is more accurate than electromyography-based prediction alone. Research and education are integrated through student-led construction of ultrasound imaging and electromyography-based human-machine interaction platforms for children with special needs. The human-machine interaction platforms may accelerate learning in children with special needs and offers research opportunities for high school-age students from underrepresented groups in STEM. <br/><br/>The PI's long-term career goal is to build a full-scale, feedforward musculoskeletal model that predicts human intent by obtaining signals from wearable ultrasound sensors attached to different limb muscles. Toward this goal, the project will derive control strategies that use ultrasound imaging to predict weakened voluntary effort of a person with incomplete spinal cord injury and provide assistance as-needed during walking with a hybrid exoskeleton. The research objectives of the proposal are to: (1) formulate an ultrasound imaging-based observer to predict voluntary effort in ankle muscles and (2) use the prediction in an ankle control strategy. An optimal ultrasound imaging-derived surrogate signal to measure voluntary effort will be determined, and a functional mapping between the surrogate signals and voluntary effort will be formulated. The stability and convergence conditions for the observer and the ankle controller will be established. The new intent prediction and control framework will be directly compared to electromyography-based prediction and control methods. Functional electrical stimulation of the ankle muscles that produce multi-plane ankle movements will also be investigated. To target the intended ankle muscle, ultrasound imaging-based feedback will be evaluated to optimize current in the stimulation electrodes. The project facilitates a breakthrough rehabilitation therapy that uses non-invasive, wearable ultrasound sensors to collect, monitor, and control muscle activity of persons with incomplete spinal cord injury.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Concrete versions of this decomposition/filtering/reconstruction process, sometimes referred to as the ""time-frequency"" method, are performed in a broad range of real-world applications, such as audio or image compression, image pattern or facial recognition, data assimilation, compressed sensing and many others. A similar procedure is employed in tomographic imaging, where the shape of a solid body is reconstructed by means of sampling the body's density along penetrating waves, which can be mathematically described as lines in three dimensional space.  The first main component of this mathematics research project deals with toy mathematical models of sampling three and higher dimensional objects (for instance, solid bodies) along lower dimensional sets such as lines or planes. The second, deeply related component of this project is concerned with extending the time-frequency decomposition method to suitable vector-valued signals. Integral components of the project are the training of graduate and undergraduate students within the active research group in Harmonic Analysis and Partial Differential Equation at University of Virginia, as well as the mentoring and research start-up of undergraduates, graduate students and researchers coming from underrepresented groups in the profession.<br/><br/>This Harmonic Analysis research project deals with singular integral operators exhibiting further invariance properties, such as modulation or rotational symmetries, in addition to those (translation and dilation invariance) characterizing Calderon-Zygmund operators: a fundamental example is the Carleson maximal operator dictating pointwise convergence of the Fourier series of square-integrable functions.The first part of this research project deals with rotation invariant singular integrals: in particular, with the Hilbert transform along Lipschitz vector fields. The PI will work on a novel characterization of those vector fields giving rise to a bounded directional Hilbert transform, in terms of boundedness of the related directional maximal function. The PI also proposes an array of model problems, of independent interest, obtained by constraining the range of the vector field. A novelty is that questions set up in higher dimensional ambient spaces are considered. The intrinsic multi-parameter nature of directional operators leads naturally to connected outstanding questions on the theory of double Fourier series: the parabolic and the polygonal summation problems. The second, related circle of problems investigated in this project concerns linear and multilinear singular integrals acting on Banach space valued functions: among other questions, the PI will investigate T(1)-type operator valued theorems in the multilinear setting, and fully noncommutative analogues of Carleson's theorem. The strength and relevance of operator-valued type theorems are that they self-improve to their multi-parameter analogues, which are of interest for applications and are often not attainable with direct techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Organic solutions of lithium salts have become ubiquitous to science and engineering, through their use in energy storage, pharmaceutical formulations, and industrial chemical processes. Lithium salts contain positively charged lithium ions (""cations"") and negatively charged ions (""anions""). How the molecules of the solvent are arranged around the cations and anions of the salt determines the properties of the solution, for instance its electrical conductivity.  Observing such molecular arrangements is difficult because the molecules and ions are always moving quickly throughout the solution.   Professor Kuroda's group uses advanced laser spectroscopies to instantaneously probe the spatial arrangement of the lithium salt components in the liquid. These studies are advancing scientists' general understanding of the structure of ionic solutions, and may ultimately help engineers design lithium salt solutions for different technological applications.<br/> <br/>Prof. Daniel G. Kuroda and his research group utilizes an array of infrared laser spectroscopies, including two dimensional infrared spectroscopy, to obtain dynamics and structural information about lithium salts in the organic solvents. The approach has shown substantial promise on its own, but when combined with well-established theoretical methodologies provides direct molecular insights. Thus, the experimental methodology allows one to obtain a comprehensive molecular picture of lithium salts in different organic solutions, including the formation and dissociation of ion pairs. The research products also serve as guides for the rational design of the lithium salt solutions in applications, such as electrochemical storage systems. All of the students involved in the project receive training in modern ultrafast laser spectroscopies, computer simulations, data analysis, and theoretical modeling.

In the extreme, the accumulation of harmful mutations can lead to population extinction. The genetic information in mitochondria - the main source of energy production in most complex organisms - is usually passed intact from parents to offspring. Thus, the mitochondria should be especially prone to the buildup of harmful mutations. However, mitochondria have maintained their function for more than one billion years; how and why is an important question in evolutionary biology. This research uses a model snail system to address these questions. It takes advantage of the fact that some lineages of snails pass both their nuclear and mitochondrial genomes on to their offspring without any genetic shuffling; a process that accelerates the accumulation of mutations in these snails. By contrast, there is shuffling of genetic material between parents and offspring in other lineages of the same snail species. This project will compare different lineages of snails, some with genetic shuffling and some without. In doing so, this research will explore how harmful mutations are cleared from populations. Reducing the impact of harmful mutations is important for keeping organisms healthy. In turn, healthy organisms can guard against population extinction. It is possible that harmful mutations in the mitochondria are compensated for by mutations in nuclear genes. This hypothesis will also be tested by this research. Because functional mitochondria are important to the health of many organisms, the research will be relevant to the biomedical and agricultural communities. The research will also train a new generation of scientists and broaden participation in biology. The broader impacts include collaborations with high school students and museums. The project will also extend an award-winning partnership with the National Center for Science Education to new audiences.<br/><br/>The research combines genetic and functional methods to test for signatures of mitochondrial-nuclear coevolution in the New Zealand freshwater snail Potamopyrgus antipodarum. In this snail system, some lineages are sexual and others are asexual. Crucially for this study, the asexual lineages of P. antipodarum have higher mitochondrial substitution rates than the sexual lineages. This contrast in mitochondrial substitution rates permits the study's two objectives. Objective 1 will test the hypothesis that higher mitochondrial substitution rates in asexual versus sexual lineages drive stronger mitochondrial-nuclear molecular coevolutionary dynamics. One prediction of these coevolutionary dynamics is that substitution rates for proteins encoded by the nuclear genome that are then targeted to the mitochondria will be higher than the substitution rates in control nuclear gene sets. Objective 2 will test for functional effects of mitonuclear interactions on mitochondrial respiration and snail metabolic rate. Since temperature can impact snail metabolic rates, the second objective will include four different temperature treatments. Results of this research will contribute to our understanding of the mitochondrial-nuclear interactions that define eukaryotes. Furthermore, they are of broad relevance to genome evolution, speciation, and the functional and evolutionary consequences of reproductive mode variation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Like a bell sounding its last notes, these problems all share a common feature: they exhibit oscillations with exponentially decaying amplitudes around an equilibrium state. A famous theoretical example concerns gravitational waves, recently detected by the LIGO detector. In technological settings, the ratio between the oscillation and decay rates to equilibrium is called the quality factor. Minimizing this ratio improves the stability and rigidity properties of the materials involved. Such technological applications include engineering graphene-like insulators; conception of waveguides and optic fibers; and design of high-quality microelectrical systems. <br/><br/>The mathematical study of such phenomena relies on a unified framework called resonance theory. It investigates natural  generalizations of time-harmonic states in situations where the energy may escape or decay. Generalized energies of such states form a discrete set of complex numbers called quantum resonances (in quantum scattering), quasinormal modes (in general relativity) or Pollicott--Ruelle resonances (in dynamical systems). Their imaginary parts describe the typical frequency of the associated resonant states while the real parts describe their decay or growth outside bounded regions. Mathematically, they are the poles of the meromorphic continuation of the Hamiltonian resolvent. Much of the theoretical work consists in studying their stability and asymptotic distributions; and how they affect time evolution. This project specifically deals with the emergence of resonances under symmetry-breaking perturbations in periodic structures; the exponential convergence of Hawking radiation in black-hole spacetimes; and the relation between topology and Pollicott--Ruelle resonances in dynamical systems.

Our knowledge of the mathematical universe comes through deduction from axioms. This knowledge is inherently incomplete, and there is a wide range of questions that cannot be decided from the standard axioms. Set theorists have developed and studied additional axioms that allow settling some of these questions. These axioms are broadly divided into two types: Large cardinal axioms, and forcing axioms. The large cardinal axioms form a natural hierarchy ordered by axiomatic strength. Forcing axioms have applications outside set theory. This project involves the development of new forcing axioms primarily meant to deal with questions related to the second uncountable cardinal, methods for applications of these axioms, the theory of large cardinal axioms primarily at the level of strength expected to be connected to the new forcing axioms (the level of supercompact cardinals), and other applications of large cardinal axioms at this strength, primarily to questions of infinitary combinatorics. While there has been a large body of work on forcing axioms related to the first uncountable cardinal, analogous forcing axioms related to the second uncountable cardinal were only discovered recently. Similarly the theory of large cardinal axioms at the level of supercompact cardinals is only now beginning to come into focus. This project will obtain results in these emerging subjects, develop methods that open these subjects to broader research, and aim to apply them to some long standing open problems.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This project deals with several central areas in set theory: (i) forcing axioms and their applications; (ii) inner models theory; and (iii) infinitary combinatorics. Forcing axioms are strengthenings of the Baire category theorem that allow meeting a prescribed number of dense sets with filters in prescribed classes of partial orders. In connection with (i) this project is particularly concerned with higher analogues of the proper forcing axiom (PFA). PFA, developed in the early 1980s, allows meeting aleph_1 dense sets in proper partial orders. It has proved incredibly useful both as a starting point for consistency proofs and as an axiom leading to set theoretic structure theorems. Recent work of the PI shows that there are analogues of PFA which involve meeting more than aleph_1 dense sets. Separately, the PI developed new reflection principles at aleph_2. It is one of the goals of this project to combine the higher analogues of PFA with these reflection principles, and use the new resulting axioms to extend applications of PFA to new contexts. The inner models program has as its main goal the construction of models for large cardinal axioms from assumptions that do not directly involve large cardinals (for example from forcing axioms). In connection with (ii), this project is primarily concerned with the theory of inner models at the level of supercompact cardinals. In connections with (iii) this project is primarily concerned with the tree property, a remnant of large cardinal strength that can consistently hold at small cardinals. One of the goals of the project is to obtain it simultaneously at all successors in increasingly large intervals of cardinals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Epitaxial growth of these materials with various mechanical boundary conditions provides control over the superstructure and thus the properties. Unique parameters that are not available in bulk processing allow understanding of the fundamentals of transport mechanisms, and also allow tuning and isolation of different types of conduction, leading to metastable structures, and revealing lower-dimensional conduction paths.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The local study of holomorphic maps close to a fixed point is well understood (although not complete) in one complex dynamics. In several dimensions however, the situation becomes much more complicated.

Apart from structural engineering applications that is the main focus of the project, the findings can be also used for a plethora of applications involving intelligent, automated, autonomous decision support frameworks.

The planned activities impact a wide audience including school students and teachers, undergraduate and graduate students, researchers, faculty and practicing engineers.<br/><br/>In this project, engineering decision-making is suggested to be approached from a stochastic optimal control and reinforcement learning perspective, embracing and fully integrating predictive physics-based stochastic models and uncertain life-cycle observations. Owing to the vital role of decision-making in engineering problems, this viewpoint leads to condition-based estimation rules for structural systems and an enhanced new meaning of performance-based analysis. The traditional approach to structural design, analysis, retrofit, recovery and maintenance is also reconsidered, from a conventional static optimization problem to an integrated lifelong controlling process of ever changing structures. The central stochastic control component is based on fully and Partially Observable Markov Decision Processes, asynchronous dynamic programming and deep reinforcement learning techniques. Several theoretical pursuits and advances are needed to enable such a decision-making approach to aging structures and infrastructure systems in the presence of risks and uncertainties. In this project, answers to main challenges will be investigated, such as the curses of dimensionality and history, together with solutions for multiple objectives and decision makers, incorporation of nonlinear filtering, structural reliability updating, and generalized fragility functions, among others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A self-organizing process, SSID is a versatile method for fabricating bi-continuous metal-metal composites and porous metals at nano/meso scales. SSID opens a new route to synthesize such structures, particularly in non-noble metals. SSID may also potentially be used to create high surface area metal/metal oxides with high thermal stability and chemical reactivity. The processing-structure-property correlations in these materials will be characterized by in situ synchrotron techniques.

Servers store information, permit computing resource sharing, connect fax machines and printers over networks, support digital video and audio file streaming, and much more. Physically, a server may be a large single device or a collection of such devices that run continuously without direct user input. At the other end of the scale are small servers, computers that connect a network of users for a particular purpose, such as a private email server. Server location, ownership, and operation are critical to the privacy and security of the data they hold. But despite being indispensable, servers work in the background of our lives and remain essentially distant and hidden for the average user. In the research supported by this award, which trains a graduate student in methods of conducting empirically-grounded scientific fieldwork, the researcher investigates how users understand this ""invisible"" but indispensable technology, and how that understanding affects how users actively relate to, interact with, and protect the servers on which they depend. The research is important for social scientists wanting to understand how ideas of time and place are changed by modern technologies, as well as for policy makers concerned to understand technology's political and social effects.<br/><br/>The research will be conducted by University of California, Irvine, anthropology doctoral student Evan Conaway, who is supervised by Dr. Tom Boellstorff.  Because there is such a wide diversity of server types and users, the researcher has chosen to focus on the servers used by one particular user community. This will allow him to study the issues in greater depth than would be possible if he attempted to cover all servers and all users. The community he has chosen are those who employ servers for role-taking activities. The researcher will explore how and to what extent a regionally stratified sample of these users experience servers as places in and of themselves; as machines for the storage and practice of memory; and as meaningful cultural objects. He will further examine how those experiences affect how the users deploy servers as well as how they understand time, place, and property.  Mr. Conaway will conduct twelve months of ethnographic fieldwork with three groups connected not by a direct network of interest, but by this common engagement with servers. He will collect data through participant observation, interviews, surveys, and archival research. Findings from the research will address debates and controversies around the location of internet infrastructure, data ownership and security, and emerging issues in intellectual property law.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ordinary matter confined in 1D can behave quite differently than in two or three dimensions. Understanding this behavior has become increasingly important as the feature sizes in electronic devices continue to decrease. To explore the effects of confinement in 1D, the research team will use a model system of helium atoms confined in tailored materials with nanometer channels that are only a few atoms wide. This system offers the unique advantage that the interactions of the particles can be varied over a large range: from weak interactions, relevant to trapped atoms used for quantum computing, to strong interactions, as in one-dimensional electronic wires in integrated circuits. Neutron scattering studies which can probe both the structure and motion of the nanoconfined helium will allow the investigators to measure and discover unique physical behavior in one dimension. State-of-the-art computer simulations will be used to perform numerical experiments in tandem with those undertaken in the laboratory, providing an opportunity to test theoretical predictions. <br/><br/>This project will also support broad interdisciplinary training of graduate students in sample synthesis and characterization, and in experimental and high-performance computational techniques. In addition, the researchers will develop an online course in Quantum Fluids and Solids, filling an existing curricular gap and engaging with a broad group of students on a topic of fundamental and technological importance.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports joint experimental and theoretical research to explore quantum many-body physics in one spatial dimension using helium as a model system.  One-dimensional systems have been of long-standing interest due to a profound difference from their two- and three-dimensional counterparts, whose properties can be described in terms of quasiparticles.  This quasiparticle picture breaks down completely in one dimension where the fundamental excitations are collective and described by the universal Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid (TLL) theory. The research team will develop, optimize, and explore a novel platform for TLL physics.  The project consists of tightly coupled experimental and quantum-simulation research to (1) fabricate ordered templated porous materials preplated with rare-gas adsorbates as a confinement platform exhibiting nanometer-scale pores; (2) Perform elastic neutron scattering measurements of the static correlation function; and (3) Carry out inelastic neutron scattering measurements. The main focus of the research team will be on two areas where theory predicts novel new behavior that has not been verified experimentally: (1) static correlations where TLL predicts an algebraic decay in the correlations even though no true long-range order is possible; and (2) the dynamical excitations of the liquid where a particle-hole-like excitation spectrum is predicted independent of the particle statistics.  The integration of ab initio simulations with experimental scattering measurements will yield unambiguous confirmation of exotic field theory predictions in the laboratory.<br/><br/>This research will develop a deeper fundamental understanding of a model that is not only central to many areas of current interest, but also has technological applications in nanoelectronics, atomtronics, quantum sensing, and quantum-information science. The project will also provide students with broad interdisciplinary training in synthesis and characterization, low-temperature techniques, x-ray and neutron scattering, use of national facilities, as well as field theory and high-performance computation. In addition, the researchers will develop an online course in Quantum Fluids and Solids, filling an existing curricular gap and engaging with a broad group of students on a topic of fundamental and technological importance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The atmosphere can be an important source of material from rain and from dust. In some parts of the oceans, input of elements such as iron from dust (and possibly rain) can play an important role in stimulating the growth of phytoplankton, the base of the marine food chain. This study will involve collection and analysis of a two-year time-series of filtered air samples from two locations in the subarctic North Pacific, aimed at understanding the inputs of metals to the ocean surface from Alaskan and Asian dust and from fossil fuel combustion. The dust time series observations and analyses proposed will provide insight that will aid the interpretation of observations from the 2018 U.S. GEOTRACES Pacific Meridional Transect expedition. This project will support a graduate student for two years and will be the basis of his or her Ph.D. research.<br/><br/>The investigators will collect atmospheric dust samples from two land-based locations well suited to capture the flux to surface waters of the subarctic North Pacific. One is on the northern side of the Aleutian chain, and the second is an island to the northeast (Middleton Island), at the shelf break, in the northern Gulf of Alaska. Sampling will be carried out year round at Middleton Island using an automated sampling system, while high-volume sampling will be carried out for one month at each of the two locations during targeted known seasonal events. These will help infer and characterize inputs from Asian dust, known to occur primarily in the spring, and from Alaskan dust, known to occur primarily in the autumn. Samples from large events will be made available to the GEOTRACES research community for analyses. The HYSPLIT model will be used to simulate dust transport and deposition, for comparison to observations. Previous work documents substantial interannual variability in dust fluxes from Alaska and from Asia, and volcanic ash input is even more variable. Given the seasonality and interannual and spatial variability of the dust sources, and the short residence time of Fe and other trace elements and isotopes in surface waters, this history of deposition from dust and fossil fuel combustion, and its geochemical characterization, will help to distinguish the various inputs more comprehensively than is possible with a single research cruise.&#8232;A variety of size fractions will be collected and analyzed to infer the particle size range that contains each of the metals. Analyses will be carried out on over twenty elements, including Fe, Al, the REE, the isotopes of Pb, Sr and Nd (the tracers that best distinguish the dust source end members), and metals including V and Ag to infer contributions from fossil fuel combustion. Activities in air of the natural radionuclides lead-210 and beryllium-7, and their depositional fluxes, will be determined to convert elemental concentrations in dust into flux estimates to surface waters. Experiments will evaluate the control of different organic ligands on the solubility of iron and other metals in surface seawater, the relative solubility of different size fractions, and the relative solubility of dust- versus fossil fuel-derived metals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key innovative aspects of the investigated techniques include: i) principled design that considers the strong adversarial models imposed by the latest exploitation advancements, i.e., disclosure-aided exploitation and data-only attacks, against which effective countermeasures remain an open problem; ii) novel code specialization and data protection techniques, to introduce process-level unpredictability and limit the exposure of critical data; iii) hardware-assisted implementation by leveraging recent and upcoming processor features to minimize the performance impact of the applied protections; and iv) focus on practical considerations, such as operational compatibility and non-disruptive deployment. The outcomes of this research effort are expected to improve the state of the art in defenses against advanced exploits, and achieve substantial practical impact by shielding existing vulnerable applications against exploitation, benefiting both end users and security researchers.

Coastal erosion and land loss is threatening many sections of the U.S. coastlines and coastal communities.  Extreme events such as hurricanes driving storm waves and surges, as well as sea level rise are accelerating coastal erosion.  The prediction and assessment of coastal erosion has advanced significantly over the last decades.  However, significant knowledge gaps exist with regard to the characterization and mechanics of impacted coastal soils.  This award supports fundamental research to advance the understanding of soil behavior in response to waves, currents, tides, and associated morphodynamics in the coastal zone.  This knowledge will contribute to the improvement of the prediction, assessment and mitigation of coastal erosion and stability of coastal infrastructure.  The award involves several disciplines including geotechnical engineering, coastal sciences and engineering, geophysics, and oceanography.  The multi-disciplinary approach will feature field and laboratory experiments.  The education plan includes a field research experience for freshman undergraduates with an emphasis on students from low-income backgrounds.  It also includes an adult education program to educate the public about risks to coastal infrastructure associated with sea level rise, coastal inundation and erosion.  The education plan will help to train a new generation of coastal and geotechnical engineers, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in civil engineering, and raise public awareness for risks associated to sea level rise, coastal inundation and erosion, and is aligned with NSF INCLUDES.<br/><br/>The role of geotechnical soil behavior for coastal erosion processes is still not fully understood, mostly resulting from a lack of geotechnical data in coastal areas affected by energetic hydrodynamics and morphodynamics.  This research is to fill this knowledge gap by: 1) measuring sediment strength and pore pressure of coastal and nearshore sediments under hydrodynamic forcing and morphodynamics, 2) testing a new formulation of the Shields parameter integrating shear strength and pore pressure, and 3) investigating the impact of variations of geotechnical soil parameters in coastal areas on erodibility during inundation and flood events.  The research objectives will be achieved through multi-disciplinary field and laboratory testing programs, enabling simultaneous observations of geotechnical parameters, morphodynamics, and hydrodynamics.  The knowledge gained will contribute to improving the understanding of the interaction between soil mechanics and subaqueous sediment transport processes, as well as to the improvement of current prediction methods for coastal erosion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These are algebraic inequalities whose variables (unknowns) represent numbers.  Because their importance, polynomial inequalities have been studied intensely for many centuries.  Matrix inequalities, algebraic equations whose variables are matrices, also appear in many applied areas, such as linear systems engineering, and mathematical fields. A key difference between polynomial and matrix inequalities is that for matrices X and Y, unlike real numbers, it can happen that XY and YX are not the same and if X and Y are ""positive"",  XY need not be ""positive"".   A major theme of this project is the development of a mathematical theory of matrix inequalities with an emphasis on convexity.  A set is convex if the line segment joining any two points in the set lies entirely in the set.  While it is easy to draw pictures of convex sets in two variables, the notion makes sense and is immensely important in the cases where there are a large number of variables, for instance minimizing cost or in design problems where it is crucial to identifying worst case performance. In many settings, when searching over a convex set, there is a unique minimum (or worst case) and there are very reliable computer algorithms to find the minimum.  On the other hand, when searching for a minimum over a set that is not convex it is difficult to be certain that the minimum, and not a value that is simply smaller than those nearby, has been found.  The solution set of a linear matrix inequality is convex, but in general solution sets to matrix inequalities are not. A goal of the principal investigator and his collaborators is to determine when the solution set of a matrix inequality is convex, can be converted in a tractable way to, or approximated reasonably by, a convex set described in some fashion by a linear matrix inequality.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to the mathematical foundations of convex matrix inequalities, developing the subject both in parallel to semialgebraic geometry and as a non-linear version of the theory of operator systems and spaces and completely positive/contractive maps. Motivation flows from the deep scientific interactions with applications such as engineering systems theory. It will advances the understanding of both linear matrix inequalities, now standard tools in science and engineering, and matrix inequalities that arise in systems engineering problems, particular for many of those that arise from a signal flow diagram. An important aim is to determine and automate the identification of matrix inequalities with convex solution sets, mapping a non-convex solution set to a convex one (currently done on an ad-hoc basis for some special cases in the systems engineering literature), and otherwise approximating non-convex solution sets by convex ones. The methods employed involve ideas from functional analysis, operator theory, complex analysis and several complex variables, operator systems and spaces, completely positive maps, semidefinite programming and semialgebraic geometry. Conversely, a significant aspect of this proposal is the development of techniques and results that contribute to the theories of operator systems, spaces and algebras and completely positive maps and of (freely) noncommutative analogs of the theory of analytic functions in one and several variables. In another direction, the distinction between positive and completely positive maps on natural operator algebras of functions arising in one and several complex variables will be investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will focus on two teams of scientists that have developed new techniques to study archaeological site looting in Syria and Iraq?an endeavor given particular urgency because of evidence linking insurgent groups with illicit artifact trafficking. Data generated by satellites have been central to this work. Satellite remote sensing works by capturing thousands of digital images and processing them on a computer through a series of mathematical functions. Despite the heavy reliance on machines and algorithms, the process of hybridizing and interpreting data relies on a series of judgment calls and individual interpretations, all of which is shaped by participants? training, disciplinary traditions, and institutional settings. Intellectual merit: Studying the judgment calls and negotiations inherent to this work presents an important opportunity to understand how technicians and analysts grapple with problems of data reliability and replication. We know little about how internal pressures of interdisciplinary collaboration and external pressures for actionable information shape researchers? judgment calls on standards of evidence and methods. As a broader impact, the research will inform public conversations among citizens, policymakers, and ethicists concerned with how new forms of sensitive data are being used to make strategic decisions about armed conflict abroad. <br/><br/>Three research questions structure the study, each of them concerned with the robustness and reliability of remote sensing data. Primary fieldwork will take place in two sites: one research team that reports directly to a federal agency and draws research support from that agency, and one research team that operates in a private university and does not rely on federal funding to do its research. At each site, the investigator will observe three sets of actors: Detectors (technicians, satellite engineers, machines); Analysts (archaeologists, NGO and think-tank personnel, and other interpreters of the satellite images); and Decision makers (agency officials and policymakers). Interviews and observations will focus on collaborative ties, gaps and overlaps in the image-generation process, and the production of policy recommendations. Comparing these two study sites will support analysis of site location impact on research outcomes. The project will contribute to our understanding of how big data decision-making informs counterterrorism efforts at the federal level. It has potential to transform the application of satellite remote sensing data to macrosocial issues by isolating the factors that lead to error or breakthrough in data processing and interpretation. Finally, the work will contribute to ongoing debates in the social sciences regarding the co-constitution of credible science and research endeavors that involve opaque, proprietary data collection and analysis.

A polymer known to dramatically change properties, like the ability to dissolve in water, in response to a small change in an external stimulus, such as temperature and pH, has been selected for detailed investigation. By changing the structure of this polymer to create comb-like of bottlebrush-like molecular architectures from this core polymer and to add chemically distinct segments, it is expected that new polymeric materials will be generated with unique properties both in solution and in thin films. The properties of these polymeric materials can be tailored for potential applications with benefit to society such as polymers for water purification and better targeted and customized drug delivery. These materials will be prepared using a more environmentally benign synthetic approach. New knowledge generated from this work will be shared with a broad scientific audience through publications, presentations, and incorporation into the undergraduate curriculum, and to more general audiences through community and K-12 outreach presentations.  This project will provide full-time immersive research experiences for undergraduate students, particularly for women in materials science and engineering. This will encourage more women to pursue advanced degrees and research careers in science and engineering. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to determine the effect of combining block and branched copolymer architectures with stimuli-responsive properties for the self-assembly of copolymers in solution and in thin films. The stimuli-responsive functionality results in dramatic changes in properties, such as solubility, viscosity, viscoelasticity, interfacial activity, and self-assembly, with a small change in external stimuli. Branched and block copolymer structures affect polymer properties including polymer conformation, chain entanglement behavior, self-assembly, and rheological responses. Stimuli-responsive copolymers with block and branched architectures will be synthesized using the more environmentally benign activator regenerated by electron transfer atom transfer radical polymerization (ARGET ATRP). The pH- and thermo-responsive poly((2-dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate) (PDMAEMA) has been selected as the primary stimuli-responsive polymer under investigation because it changes solubility and conformation in response to changes in both temperature and pH. The stimuli-responsive functionality of PDMAEMA will be combined with block and branched copolymer architectures in order to generate new materials with expected unique solution and thin film properties. These materials have potential applications in photonics, drug delivery, and viscosity modifiers, including applications that have benefit to society such as polymer membranes for water purification and more tailored drug delivery systems. Undergraduate student research collaborators will fully participate in this immersive high impact experience of undergraduate research. This is expected to increase the retention of undergraduate women in materials science and engineering at the University of Wisconsin-Eau Claire and to encourage more women to pursue advanced degrees and research careers in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This strategy will enable feed-back controls, in which light signals used to fine-tune enzyme concentrations are informed by fluorescence signals from biosensors in real time.  The approach will allow the development of entirely new technologies to control, optimize, and operate fermentations, as well as improve our basic understanding of how enzyme concentrations affect product formation.

This will allow fine-tuning of enzyme concentrations using light. These three components have been developed in separate yeast strains in the PI's lab. The first objective is to integrate all three components in a single yeast strain. Success will be demonstrated by the production of branched chain alcohols.

This process describes a wide range of phenomena from protein folding, to liquid crystal orientation, to polymer nanocomposite formation. Modeling of peptide self-assembly has been driven by applications in materials science and structural biology. In structural biology, research is motivated by the many disease causing peptides that self-assemble into toxic structures. The main objective of this proposal is the development of a framework for multiscale modeling of peptide assembly, in which molecular simulations are corrected using experimental data. The proposed research combines state-of-the art computer simulation techniques with the novel capability of using experimental data as an extra input to simulations to improve their accuracy.<br/><br/>Self-assembly is one of the most challenging problems for molecular modeling and simulation because it spans multiple length-scales and often multiple time-scales. Coarse-grain techniques which group atoms together in order to simulate larger-length scale interactions suffer from poor agreement with reference experiments and lack rigorous theory for correcting these discrepancies. This proposal aims to address these shortcomings by minimally biasing simulations to correct discrepancies between simulation predictions and experimental data.  The proposed new methodology is supported by preliminary data demonstrating improved accuracy and efficiency. These improvements allow a large number of distinct systems to be simulated and guarantee consistency with proposed parallel laboratory experiments. The increase in fidelity and simulation number may lead to the development of deep-learning models that will allow de novo design of self-assembling structures. The main objective of the proposal is to use this biasing technique along with established multiscale simulation methods to study multiple self-assembling peptides, with a particular emphasis on Amyloid beta peptide which is the toxic agent responsible for Alzheimer's disease. The overall scientific objective of the proposed research is to better understand the molecular details of the interplay between entropy, molecular structure and self-assembly through the use of computer simulations. Integration of research and education will involve the development of web-based applications for teaching undergraduate students about coarse-graining, experiment-directed simulation, and self-assembly and a virtual reality workshop to high school students participating in the University of Rochester's Kearns Center mentorship program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The simplest one is the flow of a fluid, say water in a river. In some regimes, the flow is very smooth, but in other situations it appears very chaotic, with eddies at various scales, interacting in a very complicated manner: the flow is then said to be turbulent. While turbulent flows are very hard to understand, and constitute to this day a scientific riddle, an approach was suggested by Kolmogorov in 1941. Kolmogorov's approach is instead of trying to fully describe the flow focus on statistical quantities that can be measured in the flow.  In other words, instead of understanding everyting about the flow, which might not be possible, certain averaged quantities should follow precise physical laws. While this approach was very successful in many respects, it remains mysterious in many others. In particular, at a very fundamental level, no rigorous justification of the laws of turbulence is known: these laws seem to be valid experimentally, but how they exactly arise from first principles  is not known. The aim of the program is to investigate this very fundamental question, which is related to very practical concerns. While turbulence in fluid flows is the first example that comes to mind, another type of turbulence, known as weak turbulence, might be more tractable, and provide the right entry point. <br/><br/>Weak turbulence describes turbulence as it arises in nonlinear wave equations (of which there are many instances, from waves propagating on the surface of the ocean to electromagnetic waves or quantum physics). It was conjectured by several scientists, in particular Zakharov in the 70's and 80's, that weak turbulence is described by a specific equation, known as the kinetic wave equation. The central aim of the PI is to investigate this conjecture with the help of mathematical tools: in particular, the theory of partial differential equations, in connection with probability theory. This effort will hopefully enable us to validate Zakharov's claim under appropriate conditions, which would then open the way to a theoretical and rigorous understanding of weak turbulence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lower atmospheric CO2 levels correspond to ice sheet expansion, while rising CO2 levels are a primary driver of ice sheet retreat.  Although it has long been assumed that ocean-atmosphere exchange mediates CO2 levels, the underlying mechanisms have remained elusive.  During the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM; ~20,000 years ago), the deep Atlantic was more stratified than today, which likely enhanced carbon storage in the abyss.  If earlier glacial intervals were characterized by a similar pattern, it would suggest that stratification is fundamental to deep ocean carbon storage and therefore glaciations. Recent studies also suggest the deep Atlantic circulation slowed during the last deglaciation, which may result in carbon accumulation in the surface ocean and atmosphere.  If this mechanism is a key driver of ice sheet retreat, then evidence for a weaker deep Atlantic circulation should exist during each deglaciation of the last 140,000 years. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to use data from multiple cores in the Southwest Atlantic to assess changes in ocean circulation and carbon storage during the last full glacial cycle. Using sediment cores from approximately 1500 m to 4000 m water depth, the research will assess: 1) the strength of the Atlantic's meridional overturning circulation (AMOC), 2) water column stratification in the South Atlantic, and 3) their relation to oceanic carbon storage. AMOC strength and water column stratification will be reconstructed by analyzing carbon and oxygen isotopic ratios in the shells of benthic (bottom dwelling) foraminifera. Carbon storage will be assessed by analyzing the boron to calcium ratio (B/Ca) in benthic foraminifera during key glacial and interglacial intervals of the last 140,000 years. Each core will be dated using oxygen isotope stratigraphy, a well-known tool in the field of paleoclimatology.<br/><br/>The proposed work could transform our understanding of the climate system by creating the first integrated picture of deep Atlantic circulation and carbon storage spanning the last full glacial cycle. The results will therefore provide a unique framework for understanding the source of atmospheric CO2 variability over long timescales. The results should also be useful to the broader paleoclimate community by providing an internally consistent depth transect of cores that can be studied using analyses beyond the scope of the current project. The educational impact of the proposed work includes the participation of a graduate student and two undergraduate students at the University of Connecticut.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ordinary matter confined in 1D can behave quite differently than in two or three dimensions. Understanding this behavior has become increasingly important as the feature sizes in electronic devices continue to decrease. To explore the effects of confinement in 1D, the research team will use a model system of helium atoms confined in tailored materials with nanometer channels that are only a few atoms wide. This system offers the unique advantage that the interactions of the particles can be varied over a large range: from weak interactions, relevant to trapped atoms used for quantum computing, to strong interactions, as in one-dimensional electronic wires in integrated circuits. Neutron scattering studies which can probe both the structure and motion of the nanoconfined helium will allow the investigators to measure and discover unique physical behavior in one dimension. State-of-the-art computer simulations will be used to perform numerical experiments in tandem with those undertaken in the laboratory, providing an opportunity to test theoretical predictions. <br/><br/>This project will also support broad interdisciplinary training of graduate students in sample synthesis and characterization, and in experimental and high-performance computational techniques.

One-dimensional systems have been of long-standing interest due to a profound difference from their two- and three-dimensional counterparts, whose properties can be described in terms of quasiparticles.  This quasiparticle picture breaks down completely in one dimension where the fundamental excitations are collective and described by the universal Tomonaga-Luttinger-liquid (TLL) theory. The research team will develop, optimize, and explore a novel platform for TLL physics.  The project consists of tightly coupled experimental and quantum-simulation research to (1) fabricate ordered templated porous materials preplated with rare-gas adsorbates as a confinement platform exhibiting nanometer-scale pores; (2) Perform elastic neutron scattering measurements of the static correlation function; and (3) Carry out inelastic neutron scattering measurements. The main focus of the research team will be on two areas where theory predicts novel new behavior that has not been verified experimentally: (1) static correlations where TLL predicts an algebraic decay in the correlations even though no true long-range order is possible; and (2) the dynamical excitations of the liquid where a particle-hole-like excitation spectrum is predicted independent of the particle statistics.  The integration of ab initio simulations with experimental scattering measurements will yield unambiguous confirmation of exotic field theory predictions in the laboratory.<br/><br/>This research will develop a deeper fundamental understanding of a model that is not only central to many areas of current interest, but also has technological applications in nanoelectronics, atomtronics, quantum sensing, and quantum-information science. The project will also provide students with broad interdisciplinary training in synthesis and characterization, low-temperature techniques, x-ray and neutron scattering, use of national facilities, as well as field theory and high-performance computation.

However, if the models that robots use to predict, plan, and control their behaviors are inaccurate, it can lead to suboptimal or even dangerous behaviors.  Unfortunately, as robots and their environments become more complex, it is increasingly difficult to accurately specify robot behavior.  An alternate approach is to learn the models from experience, but most such approaches need large amounts of data, in a variety of situations, which is practically infeasible to collect.  This project attempts to combine the strengths of hand-crafted, physics-based models and machine learning algorithms to tackle such problems.  Such a combined approach will better position engineers to design robots that can operate in less-structured real-world environments. The project also addresses educational goals related to this vision by providing cross-disciplinary experiences that combine machine learning and robotics. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop new theory and algorithms that close the gap between machine learning and engineering approaches to robotics, which have traditionally been studied separately. While engineering uses physics knowledge to provide interpretability, transparency, and guarantees about the reliability and robustness of engineered systems, machine learning studies data and information, and provides guarantees that focus on the expressivity of models, computational cost, and sample efficiency of learning algorithms.  The current project consists of three research initiatives to bring these disciplines closer together. The first aims to develop new semi-parametric models for robotics that combine parametric physical models and non-parametric statistical models. The second will tackle the problem of learning state space models from data when given incomplete information about dynamics and state. The third will investigate how structural knowledge from engineering can be used to constrain the hypothesis space of nonparametric learning algorithms and deep neural network models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Against the well-documented decline of the traditional American farm, the emergent alternative agriculture sector offers a potentially promising solution. But alternative farmers, the short-commodity-chain producers that have proliferated in the past two decades in the United States, frequently find that a lack of knowledge and farm management skill is an enormous obstacle to running a sustainable operation. This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, will study how differing skilling institutions for alternative agriculture are used by farmers to develop, exchange, and apply knowledge necessary for alternative agriculture. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations invested in discovering more effective means for improving American agricultural development.<br/><br/>Bradley Jones, under the supervision of Dr. Glenn Stone of Washington University, will explore how farmers invested in smaller-scale alternative agriculture navigate skilling institutions (the institutions through which agricultural management information is disseminated) to create and sustain viable farming operations. The investigator will comparatively study the emerging landscape of knowledge production and exchange in Central Appalachia and the Hudson Valley of New York. Both regions have seen recent dramatic increases in the number of alternative farmers but have important demographic, historical, economic, and environmental differences that offer unique challenges and opportunities. The study asks: How do alternative farmers construct and engage with institutions to acquire agricultural skill?  How do institutions mediate flows of information and knowledge transmission?  What actors are involved and how do they operate in relation to one another and broader structures of power? Answering these questions has important implications for both our substantive understanding of alternative farmers and their skilling strategies, as well as our broader theoretical understandings of the way institutions are formed and used by individuals to fulfill socially determined needs and to reorient the social relations of production and expertise. Data will be collected from farmers, agricultural experts, and program staff at a variety of sites including alternative farms, beginning farmer training programs, and non-profit food and agriculture advocacy organizations, as well as at an array of training events, farm conferences, and seminars. This study of knowledge development and dissemination responds to a practical need to better understand how alternative farmers are navigating a major challenge in their long-term economic and ecological sustainability. In both study regions, summaries of the results will be provided to various stakeholders, including farmers, advocacy organizations, agricultural extension, and policy makers so strategies can be developed for mitigating obstacles to farmer success.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Neil Duncan and John Walker, of the University of Central Florida, will undertake research in the tropical savanna known as the Llanos de Mojos (or Mojos) in the southwestern Amazon of Bolivia to better understand the relationship of plant and landscape domestication by precolumbian farmers. Mojos has been identified as a primary center of domestication for manioc, also known as cassava, one of the world's most important crops, which today feeds hundreds of millions of people. In addition, other important crops such as peanuts, squash, chili peppers, and lesser known tropical cultivars, such as peach palm, achiote, and cocoyam, may also have been domesticated in this region. Precolumbian societies developed sophisticated agricultural systems resulting in permanent changes to the landscape, in essence these societies domesticated the landscape along with a diverse suite of crops. These domesticated landscapes include forest islands and raised fields built over several thousand years. Archaeological data from Mojos can contribute to modern agricultural development through an understanding of how densely populated precolumbian societies were able to produce food on seasonally flooded tropical savanna in a way that was sustained for hundreds of years. The interdisciplinary research team will include students from the University of Central Florida and will work with archaeologists and students in Bolivia. In addition to generating data that may benefit agricultural development within and beyond Mojos, this project will work to enhance education and training for students and develop international cooperation between scientists and students in the US, UK, and Bolivia. <br/><br/>The investigators, in collaboration with a paleoecologist from Northumbria University (United Kingdom), will use strategic landscape sampling, subsurface cores of lakes and wetlands, and stratigraphic excavation of both forest island habitations and raised fields in the Llanos de Mojos of southwestern Bolivia to obtain complementary datasets that will be used to reconstruct and analyze the long-term agricultural history of Mojos. This research uses palaeoethnobotany and landscape archaeology to define the history of combined plant and landscape domestication in Mojos. They propose that cultivation and adoption of specific crops, such as manioc and maize, drove the domestication of these landscapes through altered fire regimes, the development of raised field agriculture and clearance of gallery forests. Forest islands were inhabited by both farmers and cultivated plants. Later, raised fields were built to improve conditions for a wide range of plants. It is suggested that raised fields added flexibility to these agricultural systems allowing more plants to be grown in more places throughout the year.<br/><br/>This award is made possible by the SBE-RCUK Lead Agency Agreement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The analysis of the equations governing physical  processes often requires a precise quantitative understanding of the relative sizes of various quantities involved in these processes, and this is provided by mathematical inequalities. An example familiar to the general public can be paraphrased as saying that ``entropy never decreases'' in physical processes;  the inequality in question says that the entropy at a later time is at least as large as the entropy at an earlier time. For more specific physical systems one can say much more, and the search for a better understanding of physical processes, and the evolution equations that govern them,  is in part a quest for new and more precise mathematical inequalities governing these processes. <br/><br/>The connection between mathematical inequalities and physical processes runs both ways, so that in trying to prove  such an inequality, one may try to relate it to a simple and well understood evolution equation.

Tens of thousands of defendants each year are now offered a pathway to avoid felony convictions by completing therapeutic activities and passing drug tests for designated periods of time. By analyzing the role and consequences of these pretrial diversion programs, this project will contribute to knowledge about the impacts of the contemporary criminal justice system. It also will provide information to policymakers, legal practitioners, and the public as they determine the role that pretrial diversion should play in criminal justice reform efforts and in the provision of mental healthcare.<br/> <br/>Despite the growing popularity of pretrial diversion programs across the U.S., little sociological research has yet examined their impacts. This research draws on national and local datasets, document analysis, an original survey experiment, participant observation, and interviews with attorneys, defendants, and therapists to illuminate the consequences of diversion nationally and to explore variation between programs.  Three questions are addressed: 1) how effective diversion is as a tool to promote decarceration; 2) what the implications of diversion are for social inequality; and 3) what effects diversion has on the lives of defendants.  Findings will contribute to scholarship on contemporary U.S. criminal justice system reform and on the consequences of using the court system to provide mental health treatment. In addition, this research will provide empirical information to jurisdictions seeking to expand diversionary options or to design new programs, to policymakers in search of effective criminal justice alternatives, and to groups involved in advocating for penal reform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will generate these insights through the design, development, and systematic evaluation of a tool for designing smart textiles. Smart textiles combine age-old processes of knitting and weaving with advances in fiber-based smart materials to create soft and flexible circuits for a wide range of applications. To date, smart textiles have been designed to do things like harvest energy from body movement or integrate the display and sensing capacities of a smartphone on the sleeve of one's shirt. While initial advances in smart textiles reveal their potential to significantly benefit society, the difficulty of prototyping smart textiles is limiting innovation in this nascent but transformational design space.<br/><br/>This research will support innovation in smart textiles and advance the state of the art in computer-aided design and fabrication by synthesizing the workflows of textile and circuit design. Developing the prototyping tool will require the following: (1) developing computational representations of smart textiles; (2) developing and evaluating novel techniques for bridging textile and circuit design, and (3) studying the unique forms of expressivity and engagement that emerge from the tool. In the process, this research will produce a set of generalizable data structures and user interface techniques to support broad audiences in designing and fabricating smart textiles. Additionally, the insights this research will produce on new forms of expression and engagement that emerge from combining computation and craft are necessary to further ubiquitous computing research, which seeks to integrate technology into the rich material landscapes that characterize everyday life. While many will benefit from exploring the applicability of smart textiles in their lives and work, prior research suggests that the practices this research will make possible are likely to resonate with under-represented groups in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This grant advances the processing of MXene nanostructures with different compositions and morphologies and their assembly into functional nanofilms. The grant will address the major research challenges associated with the production of MXenes and develop the processing techniques to form these into usable films as well as determine the resultant process-property relationships. A variety of MXenes are theoretically possible, but have yet to be experimentally obtained. MXenes exist as 2D sheets and extending their lateral dimension from nano-to-macro size remains challenging. This project will develop processing methodologies for producing MXenes with compositions and functional groups that have previously been impossible. The planned incorporation of these interesting materials into polymer composites would allow their integration into many coating technologies. The control over the material properties through manipulation of composition, shape, structure, and multi-layer architectures will allow an expansion of the range of their physical properties. The researchers and students will engage in multiple outreach efforts to foster education, research, diversity, and representation in materials science at the graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 levels, with the special focus on developing students entrepreneurship skills.  <br/><br/>The major current limitations in both MXene synthesis and processing and the underlying process-structure-property relationships at both the nano or individual nanosheet level and the macroscopic films and composites level will be investigated. These materials are derived from layered ceramics (i.e., MAX phases) and have a wide range of possible compositions and functional groups. The ""MX"" name refers to the M (transition metal) and X (typically carbon) in these layered structures; a common example includes Ti3C2Tx, where T stands for various terminal groups. The specific research tasks include the following: (1) The compositional space of existing MXenes will be extended by altering the composition of the parent MAX phase to achieve easy etching of A layers and by applying an electrochemical bias; (2) Capillary forces during spray drying will manipulate MXene morphology and create shelf-stable 3-D MXene particles; and (3) Properties and performance of macroscopic MXene-polymer structures created using layer-by-layer assembly as a function of MXene interlayer spacing and morphology will be determined. At each stage, MXene composition, functional groups, and architecture will be connected to the bulk mechanical and electrical properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The specific configuration under study consists of a single undulating fin running along the length of the vehicle, which controls both forward motion and directional maneuvers. The project will first use analytical, computational, and experimental studies to describe how the fin shape and motion relates to the movement of a single vessel. Those results will then be extended to cooperative groups of multiple vessels traveling in formation. Of particular interest are the ways in which formations can make full use of the control inputs available from each vessel's undulating fin to improve collective maneuverability and efficiency, and to alter far-field wake patterns. The results of the project will be applicable to other related undulating propulsion and control configurations. The development of these multi-agent underwater systems will benefit the nation scientifically and economically, by allowing efficient and versatile operation to explore for resources and perform oceanographic observations, with minimal disturbance to the underwater environment. These systems will also be important to the nation's defense, due to their ability to travel long distances, perform multiple simultaneous independent tasks, and control their acoustic signature. Groups underrepresented in engineering -- in particular Hispanic students -- will be recruited for this project, thus increasing the diversity of the engineering student body and the future US workforce.   <br/><br/>This research project will investigate a class of undulating fin underwater vehicles, both singly and collectively, leading to understanding of how hydrodynamic interactions affect the speed, wake signature, energy efficiency, and maneuverability of the vessels and the formation. Critically, each agent should fully exploit hydrodynamic interaction within the system, and also with the surrounding fluid environment. The objectives of the research program include (i) measuring the dynamics and wake of single and multiple vessels; (ii) developing a dynamic model of the system; (iii) establishing a control model relating parameters in the fin kinematics to the motion of the vessel; (iv) studying the performance and hydrodynamic interaction of an array of bio-inspired underwater vessels.

The HSZ displays marked changes in seismicity and plate-slip along its length: to the south the plates appear to be locked and have the capacity to generate great earthquakes whereas to the north the plates are creeping and regularly host episodic slow slip events and the occasional tsunami earthquake. The physical conditions controlling this contrast in plate coupling is not well understood. Recent investigations suggest fluids may play a critical role. To delineate whether fluids act as a primary control on the style of slip expressed along the HSZ, this study will use electromagnetic (EM) methods to image the electrical resistivity structure of the HSZ. Our measurements will provide important constraints on the hydrologic architecture by quantifying the along and across-strike variations in porosity and the fluid budget of the HSZ. This project will support a Ph.D. student and several graduate students, postdocs and early career scientists will be involved in the field work. The PI is an early career scientist who will gain valuable experience leading the field project and mentoring a graduate student. Additionally, a marine EM short-course will be given for students and unfunded collaborators to learn about marine EM theory, applications, data processing, and inverse modeling.<br/><br/>This project will use newly proven marine EM imaging technology to constrain the porosity and fluid budget of the crust and mantle along both segments of the HSZ. The survey cruise will deploy a grid of ocean-bottom EM receivers in a 400 km by 150 km area that spans the incoming plate and fore-arc margin. Magnetotelluric (MT) response functions will be estimated from the recorded electric and magnetic field time-series. In addition, controlled-source EM (CSEM) data will be recorded by deep towing a horizontal electric dipole transmitter near the seafloor along three trench-crossing transects located in the southern, central, and northern segments of the HSZ. The MT and CSEM data will be inverted for electrical resistivity and used to quantify the porosity structure across the margin. The HSZ resistivity results will be interpreted in conjunction with existing and planned geophysical and drilling data to test the hypothesis that along-strike variations in seismicity and interplate locking are related to the fluid budget of the incoming oceanic plate, fluid content along the plate interface, and upper plate permeability/porosity structure. The MT data will also image the electrical resistivity of the lithosphere and asthenosphere, providing independent constraints on the origin of the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of this project is to revolutionize propylene production from alkanes through an innovative tandem catalytic reaction scheme that improves overall conversion and selectivity. The project is based on a potentially transformative approach where new paradigms in reaction mechanisms guide catalyst synthesis. A hierarchical framework will be developed for rational design and characterization of catalysts with significant potential broader impact in the energy, petrochemical and chemical sectors of the US industry.<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to develop a new class of bifunctional catalysts based on sub-stoichiometric nanophase metal oxides that will work in a tandem reaction scheme, where oxidative dehydrogenation of alkanes and carbon dioxide reduction, via dissociative adsorption, will occur simultaneously without producing syngas. The proposed novel tandem reaction scheme has the potential to intensify on-purpose propylene production by preventing side reactions, such as coke formation, and further aromatization of propylene. A new facile synthesis method for producing oxygen-deficient anatase nanosheet catalysts is proposed by utilizing highly amorphous solubilized cellulose as a sacrificial template. The proposed experimental framework is based on optical reactor prototyping and Operando spectroscopy, where the molecular structure and reactivity of the metal oxide catalysts are studied simultaneously in a single optical cell by time- and spatially-resolved Raman spectroscopy under real working conditions. Integration of research and education is focused towards modernizing the chemical reaction engineering curriculum with teaching modules on Operando spectroscopy.

For wild animals, a failure to respond appropriately to those environmental fluctuations is a life or death situation. To date, most research on how animals can cope with changing environments has been a theoretical exercise. This project will integrate concepts from evolutionary biology, ecology, and animal physiology to critically evaluate how wild animals can adapt to fluctuations in their environment. It will use an experimental approach with wild North American red squirrels to evaluate if elevations in maternal stress levels enable pregnant females to induce changes in the physiology, behavior, and reproductive characteristics of offspring that enable them to better survive altered environments. From a broader perspective, this will aid the understanding of how early life stress can alter the physiology and behavior of mammalian offspring and if these effects are long-lasting; both of these are crucial questions in biomedical studies of humans. The educational activities of the project include crafting novel assessment methods to evaluate the effectiveness of undergraduate teaching in the behavioral sciences, the design of a new first-year undergraduate course in animal behavior to increase the retention of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in the STEM pipeline, and development of a new graduate course that integrates concepts from evolutionary biology and neuroscience to better understand the biological and cultural origins of differences between females and males. The project will also engage public stakeholders by providing new training opportunities for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students and developing new after-school activities for elementary-aged students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Plasticity in behavior and characteristics associated with growth, reproduction, and survival (life history traits) may allow animals to persist through changing environments. Parental effects are a type of trans-generational phenotypic plasticity where the parental phenotype or environment induces plasticity of offspring characteristics. Parental effects could allow adaptive adjustments in offspring phenotype in anticipation of specific environments. Alternatively, the long-lasting changes in offspring physiology caused by parental effects could inhibit adaptive responses to changing environments. The main aim of this project is to identify why and how parental effects orchestrate changes in offspring phenotypes in wild North American red squirrels (Tamiasciurus hudsonicus) and determine whether they facilitate or constrain adaptation to changing environments.

There has been steady progress towards large paraphrase resources, and a significant increase in its applications: from information retrieval, information extraction, and natural language generation to IBM's Watson, Google's Knowledge Graph, and many more. This research aims to create better paraphrase acquisition techniques and larger scale semantic resources, which could be of great use in various natural language processing tasks and social media data analytics in social science, national security, and other related fields. One example of potential applications is text simplification, which automatically rephrases complex texts into simpler language for children or people with reading disabilities.<br/><br/>The technical innovation of this study focuses on joint modeling of word- and phrase-level alignments between sentence pairs to address the challenges of extracting semantic knowledge from informal data sources (such as social media), which exist in very large quantities rather than just formal sources, such as newswire as per previous work. The model design extends multiple instance learning via two methods, a graphical model and neural network, and can flexibly permit the exploration of different assumptions and models the importance of words or phrases. The modeling advancements can be generalized to other natural language understanding tasks, which require analyzing sentences based on word-level composition or word meaning in a given context, and natural language generation tasks that benefit from learning what words and phrases to remove or rephrase.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In response to this need, robot learning from demonstration (LfD) has emerged as a paradigm that allows users to quickly and naturally program robots by simply showing them how to perform a task, rather than by writing code. This methodology aims to allow non-expert users to program robots, as well as communicate embodied knowledge that is difficult to translate into formal code. However, current state-of-the-art LfD algorithms are not yet ready for widespread deployment, as they are often unreliable, need too much data, and are designed to learn in a single session in a laboratory setting.  This work addresses these issues to help enable future robots to perform important tasks ranging from in-home elderly care to reconfigurable manufacturing.<br/><br/>Specifically, this work identifies three significant technical improvements to current LfD algorithms that are needed before they can be deployed in the real world: the need for safety guarantees, the ability to learn from very limited amounts of data, and the ability to continually improve in an ongoing, life-long fashion.  A formal theory of safe LfD is developed, along with practical algorithms that provide strong probabilistic lower bounds on agent performance.  Algorithmic efficiency is addressed via a re-examining of common statistical assumptions (such as independent and identically distributed data) and through the use of multimodal side-information, such as natural language and gaze.  Finally, active learning strategies and modeling of human beliefs are used to enable interactive, continual learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Crystallization as a materials processing technique is widely used in today's industry to manufacture fine chemicals, pharmaceuticals and semiconductors. However, in polymer engineering, the utilization of crystallization for processing purposes is limited because it is challenging to control polymer crystallization and even more difficult to grow polymer single crystals. Recent work demonstrated that polymer single crystals-based two dimensional polymers and hybrids have great potential in applications such as nanoparticle synthesis and patterning, surface enhanced Raman spectroscopy, artificial nanomotors and catalyst support. Uniform, functional, and controllable two-dimensional polymer single crystals must be produced at large scale for principal commercial applications, which is a major challenge to the community. This project develops two processing platforms called continuous evaporative solution crystallization and evaporative interface crystallization to produce these polymer crystals meet this challenge. The educational component of the project includes developing class modules, mentoring graduate and undergraduate students, and involving high school students in the research activities.    <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is developing a versatile processing approach to synthesize polymer single crystal-based, two dimensional polymers and hybrids. The major research activities of the work include: 1) Developing a library of homo-crystal and hetero-crystal seeds to control the polymer single crystal size and size distribution; 2) Improving the yield of polymer single crystal growth using a continuous evaporative solution crystallization method; 3) Developing an evaporative interface crystallization method to grow wafer-size two dimensional polymer single crystals; 4) Better understanding the growth control of multi-component, end-dissimilar polymers in order to achieve two dimensional polymer single crystals with nanoscale chemical heterogeneity. It is anticipated that such an exquisite morphological control directly leads to two dimensional hybrids with controlled nanoparticle type, loading, and spatial distribution, which are critical for their intended applications in catalysis, nanomotors and nanoparticle patterning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To meet this increased demand for highly skilled manufacturing technicians, community college manufacturing programs must evolve to meet these changing industry environments and attract a wide diversity of students. Women have traditionally been greatly underrepresented in manufacturing careers, but they represent the largest pool of untapped talent needed to address the manufacturing skills gap threatening America. Working collaboratively with industry partners and building on research findings that identified reasons why many women are not interested in manufacturing careers, this project at Rowan-Cabarrus Community College (RCCC) in North Carolina will create the Women in Engineering and Industrial Technologies (WE IT) program. The program will utilize the strong partnership between the college, three K-12 school districts, and the more than 35 partner employers of the North Carolina Manufacturing Institute to develop a replicable model to increase interest among women in engineering and industrial technology programs. It has been informed by and builds on effective practices designed to increase of involvement of women that include, but are not limited to, the Institute for Women in Trades, Technology and Science (IWITTS), National Alliance for Partnerships in Equity (NAPE), the Dream It, Do It campaign launched by the Manufacturing Institute, and the Asheville Buncombe Community College ATE Women in Technology program. Program evaluation will monitor progress and determine the most effective practices. Project results will be disseminated through TeachingTechnicians.org, NC-NET (an online source for the 58 community colleges in NC), and presentations at regional and national conferences.<br/><br/>To accomplish the goal of increasing enrollment of women in college engineering and industrial technology programs, the project will focus on changing perceptions of both potential students and career influencers (i.e. parents, counselors, advisors, teachers, faculty and administrators). Career influencers will take part in industry tours and Taste of Industry events held on the College campus, and a combination of faculty and staff will present to the district-wide Parent-Teachers Association (PTA). Potential students will be targeted through a variety of programs including an Industry Speaks series for high school students and an internal awareness campaign focused on current Rowan-Cabarrus students. Each semester at least 15 sections of college English will include exploration of technical careers. The second goal of the project is to increase completion rates among women in these programs. Women enrolled in these programs will have the opportunity to be WE IT Ambassadors, participate in the WE IT Navigators group, and have open lab events. The WE IT program will also provide increased partnerships and communication networks between faculty/staff, students, parents, administrators and industry allowing this program to be institutionalized by leveraging resources available to each partner. The three K-12 school districts play a vital role in the program, and the Career and Technical Education (CTE) Director from each district is committed to sustained, active participation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Significant questions remain about how turbulence alters flame behavior during instability. In particular, in high-performance engines, does the turbulence/flame interaction change the instability feedback mechanisms and do the present numerical models include the correct physics? The proposed work addresses these questions using a systematic experimental approach to examine various key aspects of combustion instability. Advanced laser diagnostics will be used to image the flowfield and the flame, unlocking the coupling between turbulence and the instability feedback loop. The PI will also work with many other early-career faculty to effectively disseminate the results of this research and enhance the educational experience of students. In particular, the PI will facilitate an online network of early-career researchers to share research and teaching materials. This will ease the transition into faculty careers and promote high-quality thermofluids education at universities across the United States.<br/><br/>The technical goal of the proposed work is to understand the impact of turbulence on three critical components of the thermoacoustic feedback loop: the hydrodynamic instability of the flowfield that determines the susceptibility of the flow to external disturbances; the coupling mechanisms that drive heat release rate oscillations; and the mechanism by which these disturbances create heat release rate oscillations in non-flamelet regimes. This systematic approach uses theory-based experimental design to probe the ways in which turbulence impacts flow stability, coupling-mechanism physics, and flame behavior within the framework of combustion instability. The overarching intellectual merit contribution will be made in the formulation of the combustion instability regime diagram that describes the behavior of flames during thermoacoustic instability over a range of operating conditions. In following this framework, this work will have significant impacts on fundamental understanding of turbulent flames and combustion instability, the ability to predict combustion instability in industry-relevant devices, and the PIs career development. The results of this work will also feed into the development, implementation, and dissemination of case studies for undergraduate and graduate audiences. The case studies will focus on combustion-related issues, exposing a range of students to the importance of combustion in society; case studies will be disseminated through a network of early-career faculty through an online portal. The development of the case studies is rooted in theory-based educational design, including best-practices for the formation of online content, research-based techniques for improving recruitment and retention of under-served student populations, and the robust development of a community of practice for early-career faculty centered on incorporating combustion science into the classroom.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ESIL Scholarship Program will provide support, mentoring, and training in environmental stewardship in collaboration with Indigenous peoples (American Indian, Alaska Native and Native Hawaiian). <br/><br/>The ESIL Scholarship Program will address the need for environmental tribal liaisons, individuals trained in both STEM and cross-cultural communication. To meet this need, the ESIL Scholarship Program will enable scholarship recipients to complete internships at tribal and non-tribal government partners, and to participate in extracurricular activities designed to provide cross-cultural awareness in STEM, academic supports, and professional development. The ESIL Scholarship Program has the potential to produce valuable knowledge about: (1) how a university can promote equity for all students, and (2) how non-technical training in culture, professionalism, and communication can reduce barriers to retention in STEM programs (e.g., the perceived need to abandon one's cultural identity in favor of a new scientific dominant-culture identity). The ESIL Scholarship Program will conduct research on how to provide programming grounded in the viewpoint that cultural identity and scientific identity are symbiotic rather than exclusive. The research will be carried out via both quantitative and qualitative research methods. The ESIL Scholarship Program aims to increase enrollment in STEM majors interested in environmental stewardship, improve graduation rates of STEM students, and strengthen Indigenous culture on a collegiate campus through deeper connections with tribal and government partners.

Ancient Maya urbanism is characterized by large low-density cities covering up to two hundred square kilometers; some had populations of up to (and sometimes over) 100,000 people; all had a reliance on seasonal tropical rainfall for both agriculture and subsistence. While Maya rulers, mostly known from texts recorded on stone monument, reigned over Classic Period (550 CE - 900 CE) Maya cities and states, court officials and support staff likely handled day-to-day administrative tasks within these cities. The ancient Maya provide an excellent case study to review the role that both top-down (elite) and bottom-up (household) processes can impact the day-to-day governance of ancient cities. This research incorporates excavation at the Maya city of Caracol, Belize, one of the most well documented Maya cities, with data analyses to determine governance patterns. Maya cities, like Caracol, were designed to harvest rainfall for both sustenance and agriculture, but these aspects alone did not provide for the longevity of these ancient cities. Caracol itself also thrived for over one thousand years because of its social and political organization. Additional understanding of governance at Caracol will help elucidate how this city functioned, shed light on its longevity, and provide data appropriate for theoretical formulations and cross-cultural comparisons. Research at Caracol also involves cooperation between United States and Belizean citizens, as well as building and reinforcing positive international ties between both countries on a variety of levels that include hands-on undergraduate archaeological training.<br/><br/><br/>In this study, Adrian Chase assesses the degree to which aspects of the physical layout of a city (including the location of infrastructure, standardization of residential features, and neighborhood identity) provide practical proxies for identifying governance with Caracol, Belize as the test site location. Three datasets are used: 1) the distribution of urban service facility features around the city as a proxy for the degree of infrastructural power; 2) the degree of standardization of garden city features as a proxy for residential autonomy; and, 3) the patterning and distribution of ritual artifacts and their correlation with proposed neighborhoods as a proxy for the potential for collective action through neighborhood level identity. Through this research, concepts from more general urban theory in a variety of disciplines will be integrated with archaeological research through the operationalization of infrastructural power, household autonomy, and collective action at multiple scales of analysis: citywide, district, neighborhood, and plazuela household. Analysis of the built environment and archaeological material will augment the hieroglyphic narrative and provide a better understanding of the governance of a Late Classic Period Maya city.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples include progressive collapse in civil infrastructure systems, social contagion and diffusion of innovations in sociology, epidemics in biology, viral marketing in economics, default cascades in financial systems, and blackouts in power networks. The ability to model, analyze, and control the cascade behavior in networks enables detection of sensitivities to shocks, helps develop vulnerability mitigation strategies for increased resilience, and serves the public interest in the areas of human health, infrastructure, and national defense. Due to their surprisingly intricate behavior and wide applicability, this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project focuses on networks in which components take binary states, such as zero or one, inactive or active, healthy or failed. Here, a cascade is a process in which the irreversible activation or failure of a relatively small number of components spreads through the network and ultimately results in the activation or failure of a substantial portion of the network's components. To date, progress in the prevention and promotion of binary cascades has been hampered by the complexity of such behavior. The techniques and algorithms developed in this project are expected to provide theoretical and computational tools for the modeling, analysis, and design of cascades in large-scale networks. This project will not only promote fundamental science of network systems but also improve our preparedness to avoid failures in critical networks such as, health, traffic, power, communication, and financial systems. The project also has strong education and outreach plan that includes K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, and local community. <br/><br/>To advance scalable techniques for the modeling, analysis, and design of cascading behavior in emerging networks, this CARRER project considers the optimal cascade seeding problem: For a given network find the set of components whose failure at time zero maximizes the failure amplification ratio -- the ratio between the number of final and initial failures. Two concrete classes of networks are employed as motivational applications of optimal cascade seeding: transportation networks and threshold networks. Threshold networks are ones in which a component fails if at least a certain fraction of its neighbors have failed. The transformative idea of the fundamental research is to utilize piecewise-linear functions to approximate the complex temporal dynamics of cascading networks. A special relaxed version of these nonlinear dynamics is embedded in a high-dimensional linear program with a cascade-promoting objective. Combinatorial aspects of finding the most critical initial failures are overcome through the use of regularization techniques from sparse optimization and compressed sensing. The developed approach scales gracefully to large-scale networks and has the potential to enhance the systems-theoretic toolset for analysis and design in general classes of Boolean and nonlinear systems. The broader impacts of this project include prevention of epidemic outbreaks and spread of disease, triggering positive social change and collective action in sociopolitical networks, and vulnerability detection and mitigation in the emerging smart grid. The education effort is focused on filling the educational pipeline from K-12 to graduate students using engaged learning strategies and is centered around networks and optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The vesicles, called polymersomes, have diverse applications in the soft materials community as drug delivery devices or even as tiny, nanoscale, flasks for chemical reactions.  The shape of the polymersome can be tailored in response to external stimuli such as temperature or type of solvent. The PI will focus on polymersomes made of a particular kind of polymer that contains a hydrophilic molecular building block, one that can dissolve or mix with water, that is connected to a hydrophobic molecular building block which does not mix well with water.  At low concentrations in water, depending on the polymer length and exact ratio of hydrophobic to hydrophilic groups, these polymers can assemble into spherical shapes, worm-like shapes, or vesicle-like shapes.  The PI will use computation and focus investigation on the self-assembly of these polymers into polymersomes.  <br/><br/>This award will use molecular dynamics simulation methods to investigate both the self-assembly of these polymersomes as well as their elastic properties.  In molecular dynamics, the rule by which atoms and molecules interact with each other is mathematically described by a force field.  This award will create new force fields to simulate polymersomes at large length-scales on the order of microns and long time-scales on the order of hundreds of microseconds.  The PI will aim to develop these force fields so that they accurately describe the elastic properties of the polymersomes.  In addition, these force fields will be used to investigate how adding change to the polymers changes the properties of the polymersome membrane.  Furthermore, the PI will utilize specialized techniques in molecular dynamics simulation to investigate the formation of pores in the membrane, as well as change the membrane shape.<br/><br/>Complementing the above research activities, proposed educational and outreach activities include strengthening the local educational and research environment of College of Staten Island and City University of New York (CUNY), and more closely integrating the institutions with local NY teachers.

The PI will test and assess the impact of these modules.  Moreover, the PI will establish a two- day workshop to introduce local high school teachers to computational chemistry and high-performance computing, in collaboration with the High-Performance Computing Center at CUNY, entitled Workshop for Teaching Science with Computational Chemistry.

Nearly all soft materials, particularly materials based on polymeric self-assembly, are far from their equilibrium state.  Not only is this a challenge, but it is also an opportunity to harness the structure, morphology, and transformation kinetics of self-assemblies to optimize materials properties. Indeed, the ability to tune molecular assembly shape in response to external stimuli has numerous applications in tailoring the thermodynamic, mechanical, and photonic properties of materials.  This research activity aims to develop multi-scale computational approaches that will provide fundamental insight into the design principles guiding the elastic properties of charged polymeric membranes, including polymersomes.  Polymersomes, in particular, stimuli-responsive polymersomes have diverse applications as nanocarriers, nanoreactors, and even as biomimectic systems.  Within the scope of this project the PI will develop a computational toolbox that can be used to engineer polymersomes with key physical properties. Specifically, the PI will design coarse grain force fields for common diblock copolymers that self-assemble into polymersomes, and use an array of approaches in molecular dynamics to characterize and predict their elastic properties.  Next, the PI will utilize various computational methodologies to predict the stability of these polymersomes, specifically the energy required to porate the membrane, as well as characterize their stimuli-responsive change in shape.<br/>A focus of this research project is the development of computational methods and force fields to characterize intermediate morphologies and shape transformations underlying molecular self-assembly of amphiphilic molecules.   These new computational techniques would be both verified and experimentally validated, and would allow for the rational design of new diblock copolymer mixtures that can self-assemble into the polymersome morphology, that can be tested by experimental collaborators.  New computational methods that inform the design of diverse morphological self-assemblies from the molecular level up, that also incorporate their potential for dynamic shape transformation, can impact multiple soft materials fields.  Outcomes of the proposed research will allow for molecular design strategies that can be used to tailor amphiphiles to optimize their dynamic response to external stimuli such as solvent or salt concentration.  For example, the diblock copolymers discussed within this proposal can be tailored for applications such as drug delivery or as catalytically active nanomotors. <br/><br/>Complementing the above research activities, proposed educational and outreach activities include strengthening the local educational and research environment of College of Staten Island and City University of New York (CUNY), and more closely integrating the institutions with local NY teachers.  Working with a local high school teacher who is an alumna of College of Staten Island, the PI has developed several course modules that introduce students to concepts in chemistry such as surfactant micellization.

In recent years, new technologies and applications such as the rise of cloud computing are forcing us to fundamentally change our perspective. Data is not only vulnerable while in transit, but is increasingly being stored with third-party providers that have vast storage and computational resources and are expected to offer a rich array of tools and services over this data. Traditional cryptosystems could secure the data in the cloud but only at the cost of rendering it unusable and preventing the cloud from offering any functionality over it. The goal of this project is to design a new generation of cryptostosystems that go beyond the ""lock box"" paradigm and allow users to cryptographically protect their data in the cloud while still enabling the cloud to perform useful computations over it. More generally, the project studies the broad question of how to enable computation over cryptographically protected data with the best possible trade-offs between security and functionality.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project focuses on three goals. The first goal is to construct provably secure program obfuscation schemes that can be used to encrypt a program in a way that hides its code but still allows us to evaluate it on arbitrary inputs. Such obfuscation schemes are known to be immensely powerful and would have countless applications throughout cryptography. Although this is likely to be a difficult goal and is one of the grand challenges in cryptography today, the project identifies several intermediate problems which may be closer within reach and may serve as useful stepping stones. The second goal is to improve numerous aspects of cryptosystems, such as fully homomorphic encryption and signatures. These schemes allow anyone to compute over encrypted/authenticated data and derive an encrypted/authenticated output without learning anything about the data itself. Although basic constructions of these primitives are known, they have many deficiencies that this project plans to address. Lastly, the project studies the additional challenges involved in computing over cryptographic data in the random-access machine model of computation, which best captures the efficiency requirements of real-world programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Federal and state mandates increasingly encourage medical providers to initiate punitive state responses when they suspect perinatal substance use by pregnant women.  This challenges the professional role of medical personnel as providers of care to their patients.  This study uses a variety of qualitative methods to investigate the actions of the different actors in this process, state actors, medical professionals, and pregnant women.  Findings of this research have the potential to influence government policy-making concerning substance-using pregnant women as well as the responses of medical experts and maternal health advocates. <br/><br/>This study employs a multi-level analysis to assess macro, micro, and intermediate level factors that mutually shape interventions on pregnant women.  To assess macro-level processes, a systems-level analysis informed by interviews with stakeholders such as medical experts and child welfare advocates looks at how policy domains (including drug policy, child welfare policy, and maternal-fetal health policy) shape medical agendas and encourage medico-legal collaborations.  At an intermediate level, a year-long ethnographic study of a Labor and Delivery unit uncovers how day-to-day medical practices are carried out and to what extent the state is invited into or intervenes upon these processes. At the micro level, semi-structured interviews with medical professionals and women directly affected by medically-initiated state sanctions show how medical-state collaborations affect care outcomes and patient well-being.  A key consideration throughout is the role that social class and race play in shaping institutional responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It also examines the effects of the organization of these infrastructures by racial categories in the subsequent production of knowledge about genetics, blood, and race. For example, the organization of blood infrastructures has consequences for bone marrow transplantation and stem cell research and therapeutics. This project will provide knowledge that will assist life scientists and medical faculty with their research and with a potential reorganization of research and therapeutic infrastructures. The project will also provide knowledge to supplement ongoing research and training of Ph.D. students in the social sciences, bioethics, and life sciences, and to medical and pharmacy students. The research will contribute to a book designed to present social studies of infrastructures, standards, race, genetics, and blood to a broad readership, including undergraduate students in relevant humanities, social sciences, life and medical sciences.

It engages two major topics in science and technology studies.  First, it will contribute to social scientific scholarship on infrastructures and standards in science.  Infrastructure is a term that includes the databases, algorithms, models and practices used in scientific research.  This study of scientific infrastructures also includes an analysis of policy decisions about which infrastructures to build and how to organize them; the laboratory practices, instruments, and decisions that create and structure the data in infrastructures; and the analytic processes through which data in infrastructures are used. Second, the project examines whether and how social assumptions and ideas about race and ethnicity become part of research and therapeutic infrastructures, practices, and outcomes.  This focus on race categories is part of an ongoing set of studies that has raised questions about the use of race categories in genomic and biomedical research.  The project introduces the study of the rationale for and impact of a newly instituted category of ""multiracials"" into blood infrastructures. The research sites include cord blood banks and bone marrow registries in large, racially diverse city, which are currently organized by race and multiracial categories.  The findings from these sites will be compared with similar infrastructures in a similarly diverse city in another state.

Although access to digital technologies offers great potential benefits, it also puts people at risk of digital security and privacy attacks, and novice technology users in non-Western contexts may lack the technological knowledge and experience required to understand the risks and protect their personal data. Moreover, a growing amount of evidence suggests that (1) these populations face a range of new and interesting digital privacy challenges that result from their different social, cultural, and religious contexts, and (2) the current design of mobile devices, and the privacy mechanisms that come with them, are primarily driven by Western values and do not adequately address the needs of these diverse populations.

The second will analyze this empirical data to generate privacy threat models and assess the relevance, severity, and likelihood of different privacy attacks.

The grant looks to develop new surface modification techniques, relying on atomic layer deposition (ALD) which can deposit sub-monolayer thick layers which serve as seeds to subsequently grow new structures three-dimensional structures at the nanoscale. These designed nanostructures are remarkably versatile. They can serve to improve the strength of polymer composites allowing for light-weight materials as well as impede corrosion on metal surfaces. This addresses critical needs, for example, in the transportation sector to improve fuel efficiency and vehicle performance, while maintaining safety. Beyond the direct impact on lightweighting, the scientific knowledge generated will provide an alternative design paradigm to the bottom-up design and manufacturing at the nanoscale. The educational goal is to promote public awareness of the importance of nanomaterials for the future of domestic manufacturing.  The educational plan integrates concepts of design and manufacturing, nanotechnology, and surface science across multiple levels, including a new 6th grade materials curriculum, integrating materials education into undergraduate student team mentorship, and promoting a more diverse STEM workforce through research demonstrations to encourage underrepresented students to apply to graduate school and participate in research.<br/><br/>Current manufacturing processes for controlling surface and interfacial structure in bulk structural materials suffer from poor control of geometric parameters such as feature size, shape, geometric orientation, which is particularly challenging within hierarchical assemblies of nanomaterials on non-planar surfaces. This lack of deterministic control of structure limits our ability to fundamentally understand how the nanostructuring produces specific material properties and a route to rationally design optimized structures to achieve application-specific properties. This project's effort addresses this limitation by quantitatively identifying the process-structure relationships needed to achieve deterministic control of interfacial geometry and composition at the nanoscale. The approach uses the concept of spatial ALD to generate sub-monolayer seeding areas for the growth of nanostructures through solution-based processes. The process can be repeated to develop three dimensional nanostructures on surfaces to precisely tune the interfacial geometry, composition, and microstructure of lightweight structural materials, and quantify the impact on their mechanical properties and corrosion resistance. An improved understanding of these process-structure relationships will provide the fundamental knowledge needed to ?encode? the manufacturing instructions for the controlled hierarchical assembly of nanoscale building blocks into surface architectures. This approach will be used to address two critical challenges in lightweight structural materials: 1) rational design of nanostructured interphases in polymer matrix composites to tune their mechanical properties, and 2) improving corrosion-resistance of magnesium alloys.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These toxic pollutants often end up in the sediment of lakes, rivers, estuaries and the ocean, along with combustion-derived air pollutants like soot and char called pyrogenic carbonaceous matter (PCM). PCM can mix and react with a chemical known as sulfide that naturally exists in many sediments. This project aims to understand how the interaction between PCM and sulfide can degrade halogenated pollutants naturally. The ultimate goal is to use the new understanding of these reactions generated from this research to produce inexpensive engineering solutions that will detoxify pollutants in the sediment and improve human and ecological health. In conjunction with this research initiative will be an educational outreach program targeted at underserved high-school students that will use 3D virtual reality modules and hands-on lab experiences to help students understand how pollutants enter the environment and how natural processes can promote their clean up. A technology-rich and inquiry-based instruction manual will also be developed and distributed to teachers through training workshops and online venues to more efficiently reach the public.<br/><br/>There is a pressing need to develop ecologically sound and economically feasible solutions to degrade toxic halogenated pollutants in the environment. These pollutants are found in existing contaminated sites and new halogenated pollutants continue to enter the environment. A recently published study by the PI demonstrates that PCM and sulfide together promote the abiotic degradation of DDT, a halogenated pollutant, which released lower toxicity products. This dehalogenation reaction represents a vast untapped resource for detoxifying pollutants as both PCM and sulfide are naturally occurring in sediment. Yet, due to the complexity that arises from the heterogeneity of the PCM system in the environment, the required conditions for dehalogenation are not understood. This project aims to define these conditions. The specific goals of this project are to: 1) isolate surface functionality, conductivity, and porosity from the complex properties of PCM by synthesizing PCM-like polymers as a model system; 2) characterize the mechanism for the PCM-dependent formation of surface-bound sulfur species using X-ray absorption near-edge structure spectroscopy (XANES); 3) understand how surfaces are involved in dehalogenating contaminants; and 4) investigate the long-term effectiveness of PCM-facilitated dehalogenation in environmental matrices. The results from this project will transform our current understanding of how halogenated pollutants are degraded in the environment by recognizing the abiotic dehalogenation capacities of naturally abundant environmental reagents. An in depth investigation of the speciation and distribution of sulfur species formed on PCM surfaces using XANES will allow for the discovery of a novel reaction pathway that can be harnessed to detoxify pollutants. Moreover, by identifying important PCM properties that are responsible for its reactivity, a new generation of carbon-based materials can be tailored to achieve simultaneous sorption and destruction of pollutants. This will revolutionize current remediation practices by utilizing these carbon-based materials. Lastly, this project will identify the chemical structures that are susceptible to natural breakdown by PCM and inform industry on sustainable chemical designs that minimize environmental impacts. The educational component of this project aims to engage students with diverse learning styles by incorporating innovative instructional strategies, such as developing 3D virtual reality learning modules and employing inquiry-based teaching. The PI will offer a four-week long program each year, entitled ?Water and Pollutants,? to engage high school students from inner city Philadelphia on current environmental issues and engineering solutions. In addition, teacher-training workshops will be organized in the 5th year to promote broader participation and help implement the developed activities into high school classrooms. This project will directly impact approximately 300 undergraduate students, 800 high school students, and 38 high school teachers through the teacher-training workshop.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Segments are typically tens to hundreds of kilometers long and form crust along their length but with decreased thickness toward the segment ends. Often the segments are offset from each other along shear zones called transform faults. The scars produced by transform faults, referred to as fracture zones, trace out the motion of the plates and are among the longest and most prominent features of ocean basins. The segmented nature of volcanic crustal production on seafloor spreading centers creates the large-scale structure of the seafloor and controls the way in which material from the shallow mantle flows, melts and is emplaced to form the layered oceanic crust that forms two-thirds of the surface of the Earth. Yet segmentation is a dynamic aspect of seafloor spreading and can evolve abruptly or progressively. Segments can form, grow, shorten or be eliminated by merging together with other segments. What controls this evolution has long been a subject of debate and controversy. Some models propose that large-scale variations in flow and temperature of the underlying mantle are important. Other models propose a predominant control by the motion of the tectonic plates themselves. This project will conduct a marine geophysical survey to examine what controls the formation, evolution and elimination of segmentation on the Reykjanes Ridge, a 1000-km-long seafloor spreading center in the North Atlantic Ocean south of Iceland. In order to study what may be controlling this evolution this project will map how the segments first formed following the abrupt change in plate motion and how they progressively re-merged to eliminate segmentation along the gradient in mantle melting away from Iceland. The project will support the training and education of a graduate student in the research and bring undergraduates and interns out on the research vessel for at sea experience and training. A movie will be made of the ridge segmentation evolution to help explain the processes involved in plate tectonics.<br/><br/>The Reykjanes Ridge is probably the best example of the systematic formation and elimination of segmentation and transform faults on Earth today. The project will survey two conjugate flank areas of the Reykjanes Ridge where segmentation and transform faults formed and were subsequently eliminated.  The survey will span the area from near the Iceland shelf in the north to the Bight Fracture Zone in the south, encompassing the prominent gradient in mantle melting away from Iceland.  The survey will use multibeam swaths and sub-bottom sonar profiles to map the tectonic and volcanic structure of the seafloor, towed magnetometer measurements to accurately map the magnetic lineations that date the crustal formation process, and ship gravimeter measurements to estimate crustal thickness changes. These data will be used to examine how variations in mantle melting and plate motion changes affect the formation, evolution and elimination of segmentation on mid-ocean ridges that frame the large-scale tectonic and crustal structure of entire ocean basins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Smith from the University of Akron to investigate lipid regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases. The surface of living cells is composed of a lipid membrane embedded with thousands of protein receptors. Dynamic associations between membrane proteins and lipids are integral to function, but resolving these interactions has proven to be extremely challenging. This project applies advanced fluorescence methods, and single-molecule imaging to measure lipid-protein interactions in biological membranes. The long-term goal is to develop a quantitative chemical model for the interface between plasma membrane lipids and a class of membrane proteins called receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). RTKs are integral membrane proteins that regulate cell growth and differentiation. The focus of this project is on two RTKs, EphA2 and EGFR. Integral with these research objectives is an education and broader impacts program that enhances STEM education at the University of Akron and provides materials and curriculum for enhanced laboratory instruction across the country. This includes the development of a 3D-printable, smartphone spectrometer (the SpecPhone) for implementation in university laboratory courses. The low cost and simplicity of the SpecPhone also make it accessible to K-12 students and citizens so that they can engage in real-world science problems.  The broader impacts work creates new curriculum and teacher training workshops for K-12 STEM education, to participate in local Maker Fairs, and to develop protocols for a transformative citizen science project in the Lake Erie watershed.<br/><br/>Lipids solvate membrane proteins and, in many cases, regulate their activity through direct, specific contacts. Many lipid-protein interactions are inferred from static structures or computer simulations; however, there is little experimental data to verify these interactions in situ and determine their kinetic and thermodynamic stability. This project uses advanced fluorescence methods, including pulsed-interleaved excitation fluorescence cross-correlation spectroscopy (PIE-FCCS) and single-molecule imaging to measure molecular associations in biological membranes. The long-term goal is to develop a quantitative chemical model for the interface between plasma membrane lipids and receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs). Both the extracellular domain (ECD) and the intracellular domain (ICD) of RTKs associate directly with the plasma membrane, but the chemical details of the associations are not well-understood. This project focuses on two RTKs, EphA2 and EGFR. The central hypothesis is that anionic lipids bind these proteins and regulate their structure and activity. To test this hypothesis, we determine the affinity and specificity of anionic lipid binding to EGFR in model supported lipid bilayers. We also investigate the regulation of EphA2 structure and dynamics by anionic lipids in model membranes. Finally, we resolve the functional role of anionic lipid binding to EGFR. Achieving these objectives contributes to a systematic understanding of how the lipid-protein interface is affected by parameters like lipid charge, headgroup structure, solvent pH, and salt effects. The results significantly advance our understanding of the chemical interactions that guide cell communication.

Mathematically speaking, these hexagons and pentagons can be viewed as the so-called ""Voronoi cells"" of their centers. From the mathematical perspective, these cells look very nice, in particular, they are all at almost the same width. It is an important and a computationally hard problem to produce points on a given shape whose ""Voronoi cells"" look that uniform. If we now show to a stranger only the vertices of the mentioned hexagons and pentagons, this stranger will likely think about a ball. This means that these vertices represent a ball well enough. The objective of this project is to prove that certain concrete algorithms are able to produce many points on a given shape so that if we look only at these points, we can recover the shape well enough. Such problems are of great interest and have applications to physics and chemistry, statistics and numerical integration.<br/><br/>More specifically, assume many particles are placed on a given manifold (shape), and it is known that these particles repel each other according to some potential. From physics, it is known that these particles will move around the manifold trying to minimize their potential energy. As soon as they minimize the energy, they will stop moving.  One would like to observe their locations at that time. It is conjectured (and in some cases proved) that for so-called s-Riesz potentials, these particles will fill the manifold uniformly in many senses (e.g., with respect to the limiting measure, separation and covering properties). One goal of this project is to prove a conjecture on separation distance for weaker (i.e., superharmonic) s-Riesz potentials and a suitable class of manifolds. It is anticipated that this will require developing a new approach to superharmonic potentials, as the current approaches do not work in this case. The principal investigator will further consider the somewhat dual ""Chebyshev problem"", which can be viewed as follows: one wants to place radioactive seeds in a tumor so that every point of the tumor receives some required amount of radiation. How many seeds, and at which locations, should they be injected in order to destroy the whole tumor? The second goal is to prove the uniformness properties (in terms of the limiting measure) for the specified locations, when the tumor is a ""d-rectifiable"" set. Since there is a lack of smoothness, the principal investigator intends to use methods from the geometric measure theory to approximate d-rectifiable sets by smooth sets. Finally, the third goal of the project is to compare the distributions of the deterministic configurations mentioned above to the distributions of random configurations. For uniformly and independently distributed points this has already been done by the principal investigator. Here it is proposed to work with so-called ""determinantal point processes"", which are random point configurations that arise from random matrices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has long been proposed that hotspots are the surface expression of mantle plumes, conduits of hot rock rising from the deep mantle.  Such conduits - albeit broader than expected - have recently been imaged by seismic tomography, and traced down to the core-mantle boundary under major hotspots under Hawaii and Iceland, for example. However, these plume images are still blurry, making it difficult to fully understand their role in the dynamics of the mantle, while the depth at which others originate, such as under Yellowstone, are still debated. A new methodology called ""full waveform tomography"", which aims at utilizing all the information contained in seismic records, is increasingly gaining interest in the global seismology and exploration geophysics community, as it holds the promise of obtaining sharper images of structures in particular in the deep mantle. However, such an approach is computationally very expensive, especially at the global scale, as the seismic wave propagation needs to be computed over very large distances and has to be performed many times during successive incremental updates of the image. A promising solution is ""box tomography"" whereby a target region of study is defined within the Earth's deep mantle and the complete wavefield from earthquake sources near the Earth's surface to distant recording stations is computed only once at the beginning, while successive updates of the model within the target region require wavefield computations only within the limits of the target region. We will implement this methodology and apply it to two targets of geophysical significance: (1) the Yellowstone plume and (2) the root of the Iceland plume near the core-mantle boundary, which has been shown to contain a patch of extreme material properties, which may indicate the presence of partially molten rock.  Broader impacts of this project include training of two graduate students in addition to providing a better understanding of mantle flow in Earth's deep mantle.<br/><br/>The existence of mantle plumes has long been debated. Broad conduits of pronounced low shear velocity have recently been imaged tomographically, extending from the core-mantle boundary through most of the lower mantle, in the vicinity of major hotspots such as Iceland, Hawaii, or the south-Pacific superswell volcanoes. Better characterizing the details of these plumes will help improve our understanding of the organization of upwelling flow in the deep earth, and the contrasted rheology between the lower 2000 km of the mantle and the extended upper mantle transition zone. Also, there may be different types of plumes, as may be the case for Yellowstone, where a broad lower mantle plume is not imaged. To address this, full waveform tomography based on numerical computations of the seismic wavefield is a promising tool, as it has the potential of improving tomographic resolution by exploiting the information contained in entire seismograms. However, to attain the higher frequencies necessary for pushing the limits of image resolution, a formidable challenge is the increasingly heavy computations involved. Also, not all regions of the earth are adequately illuminated by the present distribution of earthquakes and receivers to warrant much higher resolution than is achieved today. A promising solution is ""box tomography"", in which a target volume of limited extent is embedded in a global 3D Earth model, and the imaging is restricted to that smaller volume, leaving the model fixed outside of it. In many situations, both sources and receivers are located outside of this volume, presenting challenges for connecting wavefields to reconstruct complete seismograms. We have developed a ""box tomography"" methodology that allows arbitrary relative locations of sources, receivers and target volume, and can be applied with any wave equation integrator. A first application to continental scale upper mantle tomography with stations inside the target volume has been developed in north America. Here we plan to finish implementing the computation of the Green's functions necessary to extrapolate the wavefield from the target region to the external stations and to apply it to two targets of geophysical significance: (1) confirming the presence of a mantle plume in the mid-lower mantle beneath the Yellowstone hotspot, and improving its resolution; (2) improving the resolution of the structure at the base of the earth's mantle, within the root of the Iceland Plume, where a large axisymmetric ultra-low-velocity zone was recently documented, and comparing it to the structure at the base of what might be the lower mantle expression of the Yellowstone plume.  This project will train 2 students on state-of-the art seismological techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They often appear as the set of symmetries of a geometric object, for example, of 3-dimensional space, a molecule or a crystal. Oftentimes, the set of symmetries themselves, i.e., the group, has a natural topological structure. That is, one can speak of one symmetry being close to another, as in the case of two rotations of 3-dimensional space being close if they differ by a small angle. These latter groups are called topological transformation groups and are trivially related to geometry via the geometric object of which they are the set of symmetries. However, other topological groups are not so easily viewed as coming from geometry. This is, for example, the case for the systems of solutions to many differential equations which form a group under addition called a Banach space. However, one of the principal ideas of the present project is that all topological groups have natural intrinsic geometric structure which is defined jointly by their topological and algebraic structure. Moreover, this geometric structure can in many cases provide significant insight into the structure of the group by blotting out finer details that obscure the global or large scale properties of the group.<br/><br/>The primary aim of this project is to investigate the coarse geometry of topological and, in particular, Polish groups. In earlier research, the PI has established and investigated a natural coarse structure that every topological group is equipped with and which coincides with that traditionally studied on finitely generated or locally compact groups, Banach spaces or even homeomorphism groups of compact manifolds. Particularly interesting subclasses to be studied are the Polish groups of bounded geometry for which the geometric structure theory is well-advanced. Several interesting questions on the extent of this class of groups remain open, for example, whether every Polish group of bounded geometry is coarsely equivalent to a locally compact group. The research program is by nature interdisciplinary. While its origins lie in descriptive set theory, the main examples of groups to be studied arise in various disciplines of mathematics, including functional analysis, logic, and geometric and differential topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A crowd-assisted system eliminates the need for a dedicated physical infrastructure, thereby reducing the cost of sensing. Moreover, the use of crowd-sourced resources as part of the system allows for the development of new smart services and applications that would not have been possible otherwise. If MCS participation is purely voluntary, task coverage may be unpredictable. However, with incentive, recruitment of human agents may be improved. This project seeks to coordinate the mobility of participating human agents, and to optimize incentives to achieve sensing goals. <br/><br/>In this project, techniques from optimization theory and approximation algorithms will be used to optimize task allocation in a Coordinated-MCS platform while developing efficient routing. These mechanisms are coupled with incentive-compatible payment models to maximize agent participation. Moreover, a backend service will be developed to integrate these mechanisms within Coordinated MCS applications, to evaluate their performance on real crowd.<br/><br/>Coordinated mobility depends on, and hence requires research in, two areas; the mechanisms via which tasks/routes are assigned to agents, and the mechanisms via which agents are compensated for conformance, creating a rich set of problems in the fields of optimization problems, graph and data mining, and crowd economics. This project contributes towards the advancement of mobile crowd sensing for solving larger problems, with a great impact on smart cities initiatives, and the advancement of Internet of Things solutions. Moreover, as Wellesley College is a women's college, this project contributes directly to increasing the participation of women in computer science, allowing multiple undergraduate female students to perform advanced research in the field. <br/><br/>All code developed in this project and collected data will be stored on a private directory dedicated for the project on the Computer Science department server for the duration of the project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project works with high school science teachers to develop educational materials through workshops held on the University of Washington campus. The goal is to introduce the climate system in an accessible form, simplifying it as much as possible while retaining the essential elements and their interactions. Simple models are developed which use one or two equations to represent the evolution of global temperature in response to radiative forcing, incorporating factors such as feedback effects and time delay due to ocean heat storage. Despite their simplicity the models are closely related to cutting-edge research, as such models are commonly used to understand behaviors found in full complexity climate models and the observational record. The models and accompanying materials also introduce students to simple differential equations, scientific computation, hypothesis testing and the scientific method. A parallel effort is organized for high school science teachers in eastern Washington with the help of scientists and education specialists at the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory in Richland.<br/><br/>The research component of the award is an effort to understand the sensitivity of global temperature to changes in greenhouse gas concentration. This sensitivity, commonly referred to as climate sensitivity, is quantified as the warming produced by a doubling of carbon dioxide (CO2) over its pre-industrial level. Climate sensitivity is an important indicator of the risk posed by greenhouse gas increases, and much effort has been devoted to estimating its value.<br/><br/>But the extent to which the impact of greenhouse gas increases on global temperature can be represented by a single, fixed sensitivity value is unclear. Several lines of research suggest that global temperature becomes more sensitive to the radiative effect of CO2 increases as climate warms. In that case that the warming ultimately produced by CO2 doubling is greater than what would be expected from sensitivity estimates calculated at any time prior to the full temperature increase.<br/><br/>The temperature increase achieved when the climate system has fully adjusted to the radiative effect of CO2 doubling is termed the equilibrium climate sensitivity, or ECS. The terminology distinguishes between ECS and instantaneous climate sensitivity (ICS), meaning the incremental temperature increase from an incremental radiative increase during the ramp-up to CO2 doubling. ECS is a fixed value whereas ICS evolves over time, approaching ECS as the ultimate doubling temperature is realized. While there is evidence that ICS is always less than ECS, the excess of ECS over ICS has not yet been satisfactorily explained.<br/><br/>Research under this CAREER award seeks to understand why ICS changes over time and why it is consistently lower than ECS. A key issue in the research is the dependence of climate sensitivity on feedback mechanisms that are specific to particular regions. A simple example is the sea ice albedo feedback, in which warming causes sea ice retreat, replacing bright reflective ice cover with the darker ocean surface, causing more solar energy to be retained in the climate system and causing further warming. Since the albedo feedback only occurs within ice covered regions, the feedback strength depends on the warming of the polar cap rather than the increase in globally averaged temperature. The PI hypothesizes that much of the ECS-ICS difference is due to regional differences in the rate of warming produced by greenhouse gas increases: if different regions are home to different feedback processes and some regions warm faster than others, different regional feedback mechanisms will be prominent during different stages of the transition to a warmer climate. Changes over time in the mix of feedback processes can then account for the evolution of ICS. The research thus focuses on the spatial pattern of temperature increase, which is explored primarily through analysis of climate model output and a set of focused climate model experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conversely, materials that generate electricity when exposed to light are used in applications including solar energy conversion. While there are a number of materials that have these properties, there is a challenge in developing ones in which the light that is absorbed or emitted can be tuned to specific colors. Dr. Caleb Martin, Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry, Baylor University, is supported by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistsry Division, to prepare materials containing boron and phosphorus or sulfur that function as organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). By varying the amounts of these elements the color of light that is emitted or absorbed can be selectively changed. These light emitting/absorbing units are incorporated into polymers to form flexible OLEDs and OPVs that can be used in a variety of applications. This project also contains outreach efforts through partnerships with non-profit organizations in Waco that serve low income and homeless students. Interactive activities are related to the project with the ultimate goal to help increase the post-secondary enrollment of low income underrepresented minorities pursuing studies in the STEM fields. <br/><br/>The project's goals are to synthesize boron containing analogues of benzene and other extended aromatic compounds that feature boron and a lone pair containing heteroatom as valence isoelectronic substitutes for a C=C unit in the ring. The synthetic route involves a ring expansion methodology that takes advantage of the lability of the endocyclic boron-carbon bond in anti-aromatic borole reagents. The electronic properties of the boron containing heteroarenes are investigated computationally and spectroscopically with a focus on fluorescence and band gaps for application in organic light emitting diodes (OLEDs) and organic photovoltaics (OPVs). Due to the accessibility of the borole reagents, the initial targets are monocyclic systems with per-aryl substitution. However, in order to decrease the HOMO-LUMO gap conjugation is being increased by forming polycyclic systems.

Of particular importance are two common risk factors of diabetes: a fatty diet (fatty acids) and lack of sufficient oxygen.  In this project, a novel miniaturized pump will precisely control the beta cells' local environment so that the mechanisms of diabetes can be studied quantitatively and precisely.  Results of the research will transform understanding of how diabetes develops and may explain why not all obese patients develop diabetes despite similar risk factors. These novel and transformative biomedical science and engineering investigations (or experiments) will be conducted by a team of interdisciplinary, peer-learning students, under the guidance of the principle investigator. Research is also interwoven with education, where students from graduate, undergraduate, local high school, and elementary school all participate in the experimental, interpretive, and peer-teaching aspects of the project.<br/><br/><br/>The proposal focuses on probing mechanisms of beta cell dysfunction, a hallmark of diabetes, through studies performed in a highly integrated platform termed ""quantitative droplet molecular transport (qDMT)"" based on the PI's ""smart microgel"" droplets and a novel microfluidic Tesla pump.  The two mechanisms for initial study are 1) enhanced immunogenicity as a result of neoantigen binding to free fatty acid (FFA) exposed beta cells and 2) beta cell impairment as a result of a potential synergy between FFA and hypoxia in modulating adipocyte cytokines.  The qDMT is a unique tool for quantifying protein transport in situ due to three novel features:: 1) Smart microgels allow antibody binding to be assayed while modifying the antigens in situ, i.e., within the porous droplets, bead biosensors can be placed right next to cells of interest so the diffusion length is dramatically shortened, accelerating sensitive protein detection in situ; 2) The miniaturizing bladeless Tesla pump optimizes use of boundary layers, enabling a completely sealed, continuous flow difficult to achieve with conventional pumps and 3) Microchannel dimensions can be varied to create predictable diffusion models to quantify molecular kinetics. The Research Plan is organized around three objectives: 1) Engineer qDMT with cell & biosensor laden smart microgels, a micro-Tesla pump and reconfigurable microfluidics. 2) Apply qDMT to study neoantigen (insulin, GAD, IA-2, ZnT8) binding in FFA exposed beta cells and 3) Apply qDMT to study FFA+hypoxia synergy in adipocyte cytokine (IL6, TNFá) modulation of beta dysfunction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When that happens, the rigid plate is heated and releases water and other volatiles into the overlying mantle.  This induces melting in the mantle and expresses itself in explosive surface volcanism, such as those around the Pacific Ocean basin (the so-called 'Ring of Fire'). Volcanism associated with subduction zones is closely linked to the formation of economic mineral deposits.  Unfortunately, the nature of fluid movement from the descending slab into the overlying mantle cannot be directly observed.  This project will test if large igneous bodies that intruded into the shallow continental crust and dehydrated underlying rocks can serve as proxies to processes operation at depth in subduction zone hydrothermal systems. The study will be centered on the intrusion of the 2.7 billion year old Stillwater Complex in Montana, and which has since been exposed by erosion. Specifically, it is planned to investigate mechanisms (fractures, veins, etc.) by which fluids liberated from the underlying rocks and moved into the overlying igneous rocks and the degree that these were modified during this process.  The study has broader applications to the study of the explosive volcanism that occurs at subduction zones as well as understanding the ultimate source of fluids involved in ore deposits in both the subduction zone environment and in unique magmatic intrusions that are the main sources of critical materials for our modern industry. Copper, chromium and the platinum-group elements are examples of critical resources with great importance for the national economy.  The funding also will help support advanced training for a graduate student and senior thesis projects for undergraduate students.<br/>	<br/>More specifically, the work entails mapping and characterization of hydrothermal features (high temperature veins and pegmatoidal bodies) of the lower part of the Stillwater Complex and its 2-3 km thick metamorphic aureole.  This will include comparing the stable (particularly carbon) and radiogenic (Nd, Sr, and Pb) isotopic composition of veins pegmatoidal bodies in the Stillwater Complex with the surrounding host rock to test the degree country fluids were involved in their formation.  The composition of these hydrothermal features will be compared with bulk rock major and trace element composition of the Stillwater Complex up to the Middle Banded series, for which there currently is no comprehensive coverage of the complex.  These field data can be used to constrain theoretic models of fluid channelization in both subduction zone and layered intrusion settings.  It can also lead to insights toward understanding the transition from magmatic to country fluid migration in three-phase crystal-liquid-gas mushes, and has consequences for ore deposit formation models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years there has been increasing interest in the relatively new field of descriptive dynamics in which tools from these areas combine to study problems of common interest to these subjects. A particular focus is to study the structure of certain natural mathematical objects which occur as definable equivalence relations on the reals. These objects greatly generalize the objects of traditional study in descriptive set theory, and also extend naturally the objects, dynamical systems, studied in dynamics. The focus of this project is to use recently developed, cross-disciplinary techniques to study some of the fundamental properties of these objects. There are several important open questions for which the new techniques seem promising, and with which we can benchmark progress. Further progress in this area will lead to a better understanding of these areas of mathematics and their connections.<br/><br/>A major focus of the proposal concerns the combinatorics of countable Borel equivalence relations. These are the relations generated by the Borel actions of countable groups. A natural plan of study is to proceed by increasing complexity of the group generating the relation. Even for relatively simple groups, the combinatorics of their group actions is interesting. As an example, recent methods allow for a computation of both the continuous and Borel chromatic numbers of free Bernoulli shifts by finitely generated abelian groups. There have also been recent developments to extend the proposers' result that all actions of countable abelian groups are hyperfinite to countable nilpotent groups (Schneider and Seward) and to some solvable, non-nilpotent groups (Conley, Jackson, Marks, Seward, and Tucker-Drob). The proofs show an interesting interplay between the properties of the equivalence relations and the combinatorial structure of complete sections in the relation.

The objective of this project is to train models to identify portions of speech utterances that are important to their being correctly identified by human listeners, and to use predictions from these models to make automatic speech recognition (ASR) systems more noise robust by focusing on those regions.  The ability to identify important regions of an utterance could significantly advance our understanding of healthy and impaired hearing.  Improvements in automatic speech recognition would have broader impacts on the 260 million Americans who use smart phones and the $100 billion ASR industry.  The educational portion of this project utilizes examples from speech, language, audio, and music processing to attract and retain students in Brooklyn College's introductory programming course serving a diverse student body along with similar efforts at affiliated high school programs.<br/><br/>The team's preliminary results have shown that that some regions of an utterance are more important or useful than others in identifying it by measuring the intelligibility of a given utterance in many different noisy mixtures.  This project expands upon these preliminary results in three ways.  First it measures ASR auditory importance using the team's existing slow but accurate technique involving random ""bubble noise"", comparing different ASR variants to each other and to human listeners.  Second, it trains a model to predict ASR auditory importance from clean speech using a novel architecture called the bubble cooperative network (BCN) that allows the recognizer to be trained jointly with the BCN to improve performance.  Third, it adapts the learned importance predictor to human listeners and uses this human-adapted importance predictor to further refine the ASR models.  These tasks should permit the use of utterance-level human responses to directly improve the noise robustness of automatic speech recognition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will answer some of the many questions remaining about tone by focusing on a language displaying a rich tonal inventory, and a typologically unexpected system of consonant patterns and vowel harmony. These features interact in complex and poorly understood ways in phrases and sentences. This project will describe and analyze these phenomena in detail with a specific emphasis on word building (morphology) and sound patterns (phonology).  The project will provide new insights into many questions remaining about tone and its scalar properties in this language, and on the behavior of complex tonal and vowel harmony systems in morphology and syntax. The results will be disseminated via journal articles on the descriptive and theoretical findings, a reference grammar and archived, annotated language data. In addition to its documentary goals, this project will support underrepresented students in international fieldwork and language documentation training.

Kru languages in general are underdocumented, though extant work shows that languages within the Kru family show typologically rare linguistic properties. These include: 1) complex tonal systems with four tone heights, where tone distinguishes both lexical and grammatical contrasts; 2) unexpected patterning of implosive consonants with liquid consonants like rather than stops; 3) large vowel inventories with multiple types of vowel harmony, often conditioned by morphosyntactic environment; and 4) phonologically determined noun class agreement within noun phrases. Investigating these four properties and others will increase the scientific knowledge that depends critically on these linguistic features that are not found in languages like English, Spanish or their Indo-European relatives. These patterns include such typologically rare phenomena as scalar tone alternations as the sole markers of case and aspect distinctions. Due to the atypical nature of the phonological inventory and morphological properties of Guébie, a complete understanding of the morphophonological system of the language has much to contribute to our collective understanding of the possible linguistic features of a natural language, and the theoretical tools most appropriate for modeling morphophonological phenomena. Prosodic and phonological features, like those exhibited by Guébie, are highly vulnerable as languages become more endangered, which is happening in the Guébie community.

The students can apply to the REU program by ranking their favorite projects and recruitment will consider the applicant's skills and likelihood of having a successful experience as well as attracting students from traditionally underrepresented population groups, including women, African American and Hispanic/Latino students. The participating students will spend a total of 10 summer weeks at Harvey Mudd College (a member of the 5 Claremont Colleges that also include Claremont McKenna, Pomona, Pitzer and Scripps) and will work on their research projects with an experienced faculty member. They will be supported by state-of-the-art infrastructure such as computing facilities, libraries and laboratories. Students will also engage with their peers in a series of data science and professional skill workshops. Social events and educational field trips round out the program. Domain-specific research using data science methods and tools provide the students with important skills that prepare them for graduate studies and are useful for analyzing and solving problems in many disciplines and environments. The professional skill modules, including research ethics, time management and scholarly publishing, will complement and enrich the technical training and further equip students with competencies needed to become well-rounded, successful researchers. As computational capacity continues to expand at a rapid pace, there is an increased need for data science literacy among all scientists and engineers. Exposing the students to relevant concepts and tools in data science through this REU program is aimed at encouraging them to pursue careers in STEM-related fields and helping fill the persistent skill and labor gap in the U.S. by producing graduates who can have an impact on science and technology in the public and private sectors. <br/><br/>The research projects that are part of the Harvey Mudd College REU program in Data Science in Life Sciences, Environmental Science and Engineering address new and open problems in different STEM disciplines using computational, mathematical and statistical methods and tools.

Example projects include the analysis of flow cytometry data, modeling of epidemiological and public health data such as surgical cataract coverage in developing countries, spatial data modeling and analysis for health risk assessments related to unconventional oil and gas development, testing hybrid mathematical models in atmospheric chemistry, and developing predictive models for sports coaching such as real-time coaching recommendations based on play-by-play basketball data. These projects involve high-dimensional data analytics and use different techniques to extract insights such as simulated data to validate mathematical models of effective health intervention coverage, multivariate spatial regression and Kriging, time series analysis of cloud-chamber data on air pollution models, and algebraic analysis of partially ranked data coupled with predictive techniques used in machine learning to predict player performance. In addition, students will also receive hands-on training in R, Python, MATLAB, become well versed in Linux command line processing, batch scripting, data movement, use of XSEDE supercomputers, and version control. They will be exposed to big data environments such as Hadoop and Spark, learn to use relational databases and write SQL and PostgreSQL queries, and work with ESRI's ArcGIS to model high-resolution spatial data. While the technical training and participation in real research processes is the main component of the REU program, necessary soft skills for successfully developing and running research programs are taught as well. This includes the group's participation in Harvey Mudd College's successful weekly Stauffer lecture and open lab series as well as a series of custom-tailored workshops involving additional personnel from the College's academic departments and the Writing Center.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Debris flows emanate from steep catchments where they entrain sediment and debris before entering adjacent lowlands, and thus, they pose an increasingly significant threat to human life and infrastructure. In September 2017, the Eagle Creek fire complex burned nearly 50,000 acres of steep, forested terrain along the southern margin of the Columbia River Gorge in Oregon. Data and field observations necessary to determine the relevance of post-fire geomorphic responses in the Eagle Creek fire region are lacking. This project responds to the severe urgency to collect data and field observations following the fire, and could impact management activities. <br/><br/>This project will inform process-based geomorphic models of debris flow potential and provide important constraints on the contribution of extreme events to regional erosion and sediment yield. The work plan includes raster and point-cloud based change-detection with lidar datasets. Lidar analysis documenting changes in the forest and sub-canopy structure between 2014 and 2018 will enable the team to quantify how the disturbance of different components of the vegetation mosaic contribute to sediment transport. Analysis of post-fire land surface change will enable the team to test how grain size and slope angle regulate transport distances owing to disturbance. Fieldwork in summer 2018 will occur before mitigation activities overprint post-fire geomorphic change. The team will identify hillslope sites with thick sediment accumulation that are likely to produce debris flows and identify damage to infrastructure.  Various state and federal agencies are involved and a graduate student will receive training from experts in lidar techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emerging AM technologies, such as 3-D metal printing, are promising for performance-based optimization of seismic steel systems, as they can accommodate highly irregular component designs through highly controlled weld-free geometry formation. In order for AM steel parts to transition to functioning components in seismic structural systems, the ability to predict damage limit states, such as ductile fracture and low-cycle fatigue, is needed. Existing ductile fracture models lack the ability to accurately capture fracture processes in AM steel alloys due to the complex micro features formed during fabrication. This research will develop an innovative framework for upscaling micro-scale material measurements in AM steel alloys to predict macro-scale behavior in seismic structural fuse components. These micro-scale measurements and up-scaling framework can lead to the creation of a hybrid analysis-AM framework, allowing iteration and optimization of seismic structural fuse performance through probabilistic fracture predictions prior to fabrication. The capability to optimize the seismic performance of steel buildings through AM structural fuse design will promote national welfare and prosperity through safer and more resilient and sustainable building construction to better protect life and property during earthquakes and to maintain essential services and business continuities during response and recovery.  Integral with this research are an innovative middle school outreach program and a graduate-level international research collaboration with the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology.  The middle school outreach, in the form of engineering songwriting workshops, will couple music education with science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) curricula. Termed STEMusic, the outreach plan aims to promote creativity, understanding, and retention of engineering principles through the engagement of alternative cognitive processes.  The international research collaboration will include the exchange of graduate students.  <br/><br/>The objective of this CAREER award is to test the hypothesis that measured micromechanical material behavior can be scaled to accurately predict macroscale ductile fracture in steel alloys created through common AM processes such as selective laser melting. In the research, modern technologies such as scanning electron microscopy (SEM), transmission electron microscopy (TEM), and modified nano-indentation will be used to measure the fundamental localization processes driving ductile fracture in AM steels and create a new simulation framework to allow the future creation of more generalizable fracture models. Steel specimens approximately 0.002 millimeters in diameter will be fabricated using focused ion beam milling and mechanically tested using a modified in-SEM nano-indentation device.  The measured micromechanical behavior, coupled with TEM spatial characterizations of the fracture surface microstructure, will be used to inform statistical volume element simulations for upscaling to larger material volumes.  This micro-mechanics based framework will be used to investigate the ductile fracture performance of free-form structural fuse geometries (geometries created using AM processes). Potential impacts of this award outside the described application to seismic design include advances in materials engineering and AM fabrication. The micromechanical experiments have the potential to provide fundamental insights into the effects of underlying material morphology and chemistry on macro-mechanical AM steel alloy response, allowing material response (e.g., fracture, yielding, and deformation) to be designed into the AM geometry creation process. Coupling this within the field of nonlinear topology optimization, the framework to be developed will be essential for deriving optimum design solutions that satisfy complex performance criteria involving high plastic strains that lead to fracture or fatigue under various complex loadings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dissolved or suspended materials can meet at interfaces between phases, react, accumulate, and undergo phase transfer.  Bijels are a relatively new class of materials in which the two distinct phases are both continuously connected through interpenetrating networks (rather than having islands of one phase within another phase).  In bijels, the two phases are stabilized by forming a densely packed layer of particles at the interface between phases.   The principle investigator has recently discovered a new process for making bijels.  This process expands dramatically the range of liquid pairs that can be used and allows the bijel structure to be tailored.  The present work is a detailed study of how to control and tune bijel structure and properties.  In addition, fluid flow and mass transfer within these materials will be measured to assess their potential use in applications.  A third study will involve a demonstration of bijel use in a two-phase chemical reaction with continuous flow.  This project will uncover the principles that determine the structure of bijels and will lead to new and well-designed multiphase materials for industrial applications. Potential applications range from enhanced product purification in chemical plants to industrial synthesis of high-value added chemicals in bijels. A broad range of educational and outreach activities aimed at middle school, high school, undergraduate and graduate students are also integrated into the research plans.<br/><br/>The objective of this work is to determine whether bicontinuous interfacially jammed emulsion gels (bijels) formed by Solvent Transfer Induced Phase Separation (STRIPS) can be employed for continuously operated and efficient phase transfer processes.  Initial work will focus on control over bijel structure and properties.  Bijels will be formed with a selection of functional inorganic colloidal particles with surface modifications that will be developed and characterized.  The hydrophilic/hydrophobic nature and the repulsive/attractive character of surface functional groups are expected to govern bijel architecture and stability; this will be tested through surface modification of nanoparticles, characterization of surfaces, bijel formation, and characterization of bijel structure and mechanical properties.  A second thrust of the work will determine how the mechanical properties of bijels can be tailored to withstand the pressures needed to drive flow.  A scheme for reinforcing the interfacially jammed layer of nanoparticles has been developed and a tool has been constructed to characterize pressure-driven flow in bijels and assess their structural integrity under flow conditions.  The third aspect of the study involves phase transfer processes under continuous flow in bijels.  Continuous extraction in bijels will be demonstrated, followed by study of phase transfer catalysis of a model reaction in a bijel.  Educational and outreach activities include the development of a ""droplet engineering"" course for high school students, a course on colloidal and interfacial engineering for undergraduates, a course on soft matter nanotechnology for graduate students, and expansion of instructional videos on the principle investigator's YouTube channel.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objectives of this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award are to: 1) investigate relationships that exist between congestion dynamics at the local (e.g., individual intersections or roadways) and regional (e.g., city-wide) spatial scales; and, 2) use this knowledge to identify strategies that can effectively combat urban traffic congestion at individual intersections, along corridors and across entire regions simultaneously. The relationships between local and regional congestion dynamics will be integrated into a novel multi-scale congestion modeling framework for optimizing and refining contemporary traffic control policies as well as supporting the development of advanced congestion management strategies that will become available as connected and automated vehicles are integrated into urban environments. The proposed research will be integrated with a set of educational activities to advance our knowledge in traffic management and promote national prosperity and welfare. Specific education activities include collaboration with local transportation agencies who will provide data to verify the identified relationships and support real-world project-based learning activities and demonstrate a holistic, multi-scale view of traffic congestion. These activities will be shared through the creation of an electronic repository of undergraduate course materials on traffic operations. The PI will also develop interactive, online simulations to demonstrate the relationships between local and regional congestion dynamics and integrate these into ""Expanding Youth Horizons"" STEM outreach workshops targeted to local female middle school students. <br/><br/>This research will integrate novel models of regional congestion dynamics that relate network productivity and accumulation--the network Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram (MFD)--with existing link-based modeling paradigms. These two disparate approaches will be combined by identifying and quantifying interdependencies between local and regional network properties and congestion dynamics along each of these spatial scales. Theories and methodologies will be developed to unveil network characteristics and local congestion patterns that are conducive to the existence of reproducible and predictable regional congestion models for realistic urban traffic networks. This includes the identification of the building blocks necessary to characterize regional traffic network performance for networks made up of hierarchical streets and that serve heterogeneous traffic streams. Insights obtained for these heterogeneous network structures will also serve as the basis to study and design more sophisticated systems, particularly multimodal traffic networks with multiple unique and interacting vehicle classes. Integration of this regional MFD approach with existing link-based modeling paradigms will provide a framework that facilitates automated traffic control policies to coordinate regional and local traffic performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Another notable feature of the North Atlantic seen in observations and models is the pronounced, spatially coherent, variability in the North Atlantic sea surface temperatures on decadal to multi-decadal timescales referred to as Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV). With a typical periodicity of about 50 years, the AMV sea surface temperature variability impacts key climate characteristics, ranging from precipitation to tropical cyclone activity. The extent to which AMOC variability and the AMV are independent, and to which the latter reflects the former, remains hotly debated. One difficulty in resolving this debate is the short duration of available observations; another is that across the models, AMOC variability, including its periodicity, amplitude, and effect on SST, varies broadly. Accordingly, the main objective of this project is to establish the robust mechanisms of AMOC variability and its connection with the AMV, and at the same time to systematically explore the causes of these inter-model differences. This is of strong practical value as the AMOC is shown to be the most predictable component of the climate system on decadal timescales - progress in decadal prediction requires a better understanding of AMOC variability and its impacts. Funding from this grant will support the career growth of a female early career scientist, a graduate and undergraduate student and two postdoctoral associates. The project will enhance the climate modeling capacity by graduate and undergraduate students at both George Mason and Yale, and will facilitate the exchange of expertise between the two universities. This project will support several educational broader impacts including participation in GMU's Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program, benefiting high-school students and undergrads, public lectures and Teacher Development workshops at the Peabody Museum of Natural History.<br/><br/><br/>This is a modeling proposal to study decadal to multi-decadal variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and its effect on climate in the North Atlantic, specifically on AMV, also referred to as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The core approach lies in exciting or isolating AMOC internal modes and assessing their contribution to the AMV. The project will include several interrelated components: (i) Multi-decadal numerical experiments using several global climate models selected to represent inter-model differences in AMOC characteristics, in which we will excite AMOC variations by prescribing specifically chosen initial conditions - oceanic optimal initial perturbations in temperature or salinity.

Scientific evidence has documented how neighborhoods and other ""activity spaces""--such as schools, workplaces, and social institutions--influence development. The aim of this workshop is to use this evidence to help build a comprehensive, place-based science. Broadly speaking, a place-based science of lifespan development will recognize that different residential neighborhoods and activity spaces might expose children, youth, and families to different resources and risks. These differences have important implications for development. In addition, there is a critical need to incorporate transdisciplinary perspectives on race, ethnicity, and culture to advance a place-based science that is relevant and meaningful for an increasingly diverse U.S. society. This workshop will enhance the theoretical and conceptual frameworks that will support future place-based research on development across the lifespan. Such research can address important societal issues related to segregation, inequality, and positive development.<br/><br/>This workshop will allow a group of scholars to work together to (1) integrate existing theoretical foundations of neighborhood and activity space research and (2) critically analyze how these theoretical foundations can incorporate scientific evidence that has documented racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity in developmental processes across the lifespan. Additionally, workshop participants will advance a set of recommendations on innovative, dynamic, multi-level approaches that reflect theoretical and conceptual advances made in the workshop. Finally, the participants will address long-term methodological challenges in neighborhood and activity space research. The activities during the workshop will culminate with a set of research questions and suggested approaches that will establish the next decade's research agenda.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program consists of two integral components --- a two-week preparatory module for students from the Maricopa County Community College District, followed by an eight-week research experience for all participants. The preparatory module will expose students to mathematical topics that are not covered in a typical community college curriculum, including a mix of interesting ""real world"" problems and an introduction to numerical computations, which the students will then use during the research period. Following the two-week course module, students will work in small groups of 3-4 on problems suggested by mentors, in areas of interesting overlap across research groups. Participating students will learn applied mathematical concepts and numerical tools that model space- and time-dependent dynamical processes. They will also be exposed to enrichment activities including relevant research seminars and workshops on STEM opportunities and career services. <br/><br/>The overall goal of the REU program is to expand research opportunities for place-bound community college and liberal arts college students; engage community college students to matriculate into Baccalaureate programs; guide students in scholarship and graduate school applications; and establish a supporting network to assist students throughout their undergraduate programs. To realize these goals, the curriculum is designed to provide opportunities to undergraduate mathematics and science majors to work as part of a team on an interdisciplinary problem; read journal articles to gain some background on a new subject quickly; analyze open-ended problems using computer simulation as a discovery tool; and present a talk on their work at the end of the program and (optionally) at an appropriate research conference. Students are also encouraged to continue collaboration with mentors remotely, leading to publications in archival journals. The summer research will address problems related to weather prediction, atmospheric dynamics, aviation hazard analyses and forecasting; image processing and Fourier analysis; network dynamics and topology; and mathematical models of cancer (especially brain and prostate cancer). Students will be supervised by experienced faculty in their respective fields. By reaching out to community colleges, the program will tap into diverse talents from underrepresented minority groups and increase their research participation in mathematics and STEM fields. Special efforts will be made to recruit students who are first-generation college students as well as students who are female and/or members of underrepresented groups in the mathematical sciences.

The fabricated surfaces have random micro- and nanoscale surface structures that promote superhydrophobic (repels water), and highly anti-reflective characteristics that are favorable for drag reduction, anti-icing, self-cleaning, and light absorption applications. The processing method can both be applied to many critical engineering materials including steel, aluminum, titanium and magnesium alloys, and offer a high-throughput process chain capable of treating large surface areas. By this method, the laser processing time will be significantly reduced from hundreds of minutes per 6.5 cm^2 (square inch), as currently required, to a few seconds. Realization of these potential manufacturing gains will advance the national prosperity and welfare by increasing U.S. advanced manufacturing competitiveness, and will find application across many manufacturing sectors including aerospace, energy, and defense. The award will also facilitate training of the future workforce as students across all levels will gain experience in advanced manufacturing and surface science fundamentals.

This project compares the trajectories of two mega-cities that in began in the 1980s and early 1990s from roughly equivalent situations, including a relatively high level of local governance and commitment to delivery of urban public goods such as housing, sanitation, and public transportation.  Yet despite similar goals and strategies, while state interventions have reduced urban inequalities in one of these cities, they have reproduced these inequalities in the other one.  This project promises to generate new insights into the relationship between states, democracy, and urban inequalities.  Findings will be useful for urban policymaking in the midst of social change.  They will inform understanding of how cities can coordinate politics and institutional change to deliver public goods.<br/><br/>This project will use multiple methods to compare public goods provision in São Paulo, Brazil and Johannesburg, South Africa.  The methods are: a) field-based participant observation and interviews with key public and private actors; b) archival research of legislation, newspapers, trade publications, and internal government and NGO documents; and c) spatial analysis of 25 years of quantitative data on housing, sanitation and transportation.  The research design and comparative-historical methods of analysis make it possible to disaggregate changes in interactions between social coalitions and state institutions over time, and to specify the mechanisms of these changes.

Microsocopic algae, known as phytoplankton, bloom when deep, nutrient-rich waters are upwelled into sunlit surface layers of the ocean, providing nourishment that supports productive food webs and draws down carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere to the deep ocean. Photosynthetic microbes in these regions must constantly adapt to changes in their chemical and physical environments. For example, subsurface populations respond to changes in light as they approach the surface. When upwelled waters move offshore, cells sink out of the illuminated zone, establishing seed populations that remain inactive until the next upwelling event. This process is called the upwelling conveyor belt cycle (UCBC). How phytoplankton respond to these changes in environmental conditions and how they may influence their nutrient requirements remains unknown.  With future ocean changes predicted to alter seawater chemistry, including ocean acidification and decreased iron availability, some phytoplankton groups may be more vulnerable than others. Accompanying educational activities provide learning experiences to enhance understanding and awareness of marine microbes. The development of a research hub at UNC aims to provide infrastructure and support for scientists and students conducting research on environmental genomics. A laboratory component for an upper-level undergraduate course focused on marine phytoplankton is being developed. Educational outreach activities to broader communities include creation of a lesson plan on phytoplankton in upwelling zones and a virtual research cruise experience for middle-school students, as well as a hands-on lab activity for a local museum focused on marine phytoplankton and the important roles they play in shaping our planet.  <br/><br/>The project examines how phytoplankton respond at the molecular and physiological level to the different UCBC stages, which seed populations (i.e., surface versus subsurface) contribute most to phytoplankton blooms during upwelling events of varying intensity, how phytoplankton elemental compositions are altered throughout UCBC stages, and how future predicted ocean conditions will affect the phytoplankton responses to UCBC conditions. This project contains both laboratory and fieldwork. In the laboratory, phytoplankton isolates recently obtained from upwelling regions are exposed to simulated UCBC conditions to examine changes in gene expression, growth and photosynthetic characteristics and elemental composition.  Cultures are subjected to both current and future ocean conditions, including reduced iron availability and higher CO2. In the field, research cruises within upwelling regions study the dynamics of natural phytoplankton communities (both surface and subsurface) experiencing upwelling and relaxation and within simulated upwelling incubation experiments. Knowledge of how phytoplankton are affected by UCBC conditions at an integrated molecular, physiological and elemental level under both current and future scenarios is imperative for the proper conservation and management of these critically important ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Goals of the conference include raising awareness about the importance of prediction, showcasing research of current and emerging leaders in the field, motivating the development of more accurate prediction methods, and encouraging interactions and collaborations among a diverse collection of scientists with complementary skills and abilities.  In addition to attracting PhD statisticians and graduate students majoring in statistics, the conference has the potential to draw participation from the broader data science community that includes researchers from bioinformatics, business analytics, computer science, electrical and computer engineering, economics, and social sciences among other areas.  The Conference on Predictive Inference and Its Applications will provide a valuable venue for developing new methodologies that enable accurate prediction and assessment of uncertainty in our data-rich world.  Such methodologies provide valuable insights and lead to better decision making in science and industry.<br/><br/>Problems involving the prediction of unobserved but eventually observable quantities are ubiquitous in the modern world.  Historically, the discipline of statistics has placed greater emphasis on hypothesis testing and parameter estimation than it has on prediction.  Other research communities connected to but not equivalent to statistics, including computer science, machine learning, analytics, big data, data mining, and data science have more fully embraced prediction problems and developed a variety of useful prediction tools.  Nonetheless, statistical thinking and innovation have an important role to play in addressing prediction problems now and in the future.  In some cases, statistical thinking can be used to generate appropriate measures of uncertainty to accompany point predictions provided by existing tools.  In other cases, statistical thinking can lead to methods for predictive inference that strike a better balance between bias and variance or make more efficient use of the data than existing approaches.  The formal presentations and ideas that arise from discussions at the conference are intended to motivate scientific progress and result in publications that will appear in refereed journal articles.  This research will enhance the state of the art in prediction methodology, which in turn will lead to advances in many fields where accurate predictions and accurate assessments of prediction error are essential.

In many cities, these stormwater systems are too small or too old, resulting in dangerous flooding and pollution of downstream rivers and lakes. Upgrading infrastructure is a costly alternative.  Instead of relying on new construction, the PI will demonstrate how existing stormwater systems can be used more efficiently and made ""smarter"" through the use of wireless sensors, valves, and pumps to address this national issue. This approach will enable automatic control of stormwater systems to reduce flooding and improve water quality. To this end, the PI will investigate computational methods to embed stormwater systems with ""intelligence,"" helping to reduce the cost of improving US infrastructure while protecting public health and the environment. The PI will also develop training programs for a new generation of technicians, who will deploy and maintain smart stormwater systems.  <br/><br/>The PI will improve the fundamental understanding of the water flow and water quality benefits that can be achieved through the real-time control of urban watersheds. Results of this research will lead to a theoretical and conceptual framework to begin studying the impacts of autonomous technologies on the scale of entire watersheds. The research hypothesis of this proposal is that ""smart"" stormwater systems will vastly shrink the size of infrastructure required to manage runoff pollution. The hypothesis will be tested across three objectives: (1) investigate new algorithms, based on dynamical systems theory and reinforcement learning to control flows across city-scale stormwater systems, (2) study the distributed real-time control of water quality across the scale of entire watersheds with a focus on removing of sediment-bound and dissolved pollutants, and (3) explore how competing water flow and water quality goals can be unified to resiliently manage urban watersheds in real-time. Results of this research will allow entire watersheds to be controlled, akin to large distributed treatment plants, while vastly improving the fundamental understanding of the benefits, tradeoffs, and performance limits of ""smart"" water systems.

There is a significant societal impact in helping scientists better communicate and teach their expertise. There are thousands of scientists in geoscience-related fields who are teaching, researching, publishing, and communicating with colleagues in the STEM community and the public at large. These scientists, and their work, will become increasingly important in future scientific and public discussions on complex STEM concepts.<br/><br/>The project team will build on the success of previously-funded Workshops; expand the number of participants who benefit from the Workshops; further refine the Workshop materials and methodology; and implement and evaluate new materials to reach more participants in other STEM disciplines.  Each Workshop includes a diverse group of approximately twenty-four science participants, an equal number of law students (law students are not supported with NSF funds), and an experienced cadre of practicing lawyers, judges, and legal educators.<br/><br/>The Workshops will include simulations where participants communicate and teach complex STEM concepts to non-scientists in a range of challenging settings. During the workshops, participants learn and practice the role of both scientists and non-scientists to: 1) develop and build upon skills necessary to effectively communicate their expertise; 2) understand the culture and perspectives of non-scientists; and 3) develop a deeper understanding and appreciation of the different challenges in communicating and teaching complex STEM concepts to non-scientists. Workshop faculty provide individualized feedback and coaching along the way.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts involve creating a diverse cadre of scientists who are better prepared to teach complex Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) concepts effectively and ethically.

The field of meta-science, which performs the scientific study of science itself, is thriving and has examined the existence and prevalence of threats to reproducible and robust research.  Most existing replication efforts in social sciences, however, have focused on studies using data from statistically rigorous designed surveys or experiments. Largely missing are replication efforts devoted to examining those studies with organic data, including data organically generated by ubiquitous sensors or mobile applications, twitter feeds, click streams, etc.  This project examines the inconsistent handling practices of organic data among scholarly publications in social sciences, in order to establish the confidence (or the lack thereof) in the conclusions drawn from such data analysis.  Since findings of social and behavioral sciences inform policy makers on a wide variety of issues, from homeland security to national economy, establishing the confidence of these findings is critical for the proper usage of them, and therefore has broader impacts on all these application areas of national priority.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project starts with determining the extent of, causes of, and remedies for empirical research using organic data that are neither reproducible nor generalizable.  The findings from this step raise awareness about the standards and tools for collecting, cleaning, and processing organic data sets across many fields of social sciences. In addition, this project develops new analytical frameworks and methodologies useful for evaluating replicability and robustness of empirical studies with organic data. The vision is for such frameworks to be broadly used in many application domains, thereby fostering cultural change across different fields in social sciences, and bringing the value of reproducibility and robustness to the forefront of data intensive research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given that almost 90% of flowering plants rely on animal pollination, there is concern that many plants will decline towards extinction alongside their pollinators. Pollination is important because it ensures that plants can make seeds, grow into new plants and keep the species going. Yet, there are many reasons to think that the link between declining numbers of plants and declining numbers of pollinators is not so simple. For example, although it makes sense that a plant would make fewer seeds when there are fewer pollinators around, fewer seeds do not necessarily mean fewer new plants if, for example, the new plants compete for places to live. Fewer seeds could actually result in less competition among new plants, allowing more of them to survive. Furthermore, plants may use other resources not devoted to making seeds to grow larger and survive longer, thus having more chances to reproduce within their lifetime. These examples illustrate how, despite making fewer seeds, enough new plants could be made to keep the species going. A bigger lesson is that ecology is complex; all sorts of hidden strategies are not apparent until you take a closer look. This project will follow the fates of thousands of plants that are exposed to different numbers of pollinators, thereby helping scientists to identify plant species most at risk from pollinator declines and to understand why others are or are not at risk. In addition to data collection, the scientists on this project will help train the next generation of ecologists and will engage the public through an educational film, a blog, and a permanent interactive exhibit.<br/> 	<br/>Individual-based population models (integral projection models) will be parameterized with data from a field experiment in which five species of perennial plants receive different pollination treatments: (i) increased pollination, (ii) reduced pollination, (iii) interannually variable pollination, and (iv) an unmanipulated control. All plants will be tagged with a unique identification number and their demographic status assessed annually. Additional germination experiments will be used to parameterize the effect of pollination on recruitment through density-dependent germination and seedling survival. Projections of the population models will show the consequences of pollination for plant population dynamics. Finally, life table response experiments will elucidate specific life history mechanisms by which pollination does or does not affect plant population growth rates (e.g., via trade-offs between growth and reproduction).

Hardware is at the most fundamental abstraction level on which software runs. Trusted hardware platforms comprise the backbone for successful deployment and operation of these infrastructures. Research in recent years shows that as tampering and reverse engineering mature in their sophistication, the challenges in guaranteeing the trust and security of these components also grow. The International Symposium on Hardware-Oriented Security and Trust (HOST) aims to continue its role as a premiere forum that invites novel solutions to address these challenges. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this proposed activity includes professional development for undergraduate and graduate students as well as continued growth of the symposium.

From observations, the presence of tilted accretion disks around a BH is detected in some systems.  However, the physics of accretion disks is poorly understood.  This project will run very large scale simulations on the Blue Waters supercomputer to improve our fundamental understanding of BH accretion disks.  Results of the proposed simulations will address long-standing questions in the way supermassive black holes consume and expel gas, and thereby exert feedback on their environment.  These results will allow the physics community to gain first-principles understanding of disk physics in typical tilted BH accretion systems.<br/><br/>Gas falling into a BH from large distances is unaware of BH spin direction, and misalignment between the accretion disk and BH spin is expected to be common. However, the physics of tilted disks is poorly understood, even for the ""standard"", geometrically thin, radiatively efficient accretion disks that power active galactic nuclei known as quasars and thought to provide the best observational tests of general relativity and disk physics. In particular, it is still not understood how the curved space-time of a spinning black hole imprints itself on the structure of the tilted disks. This project will make use of the fact that, at their core, BH accretion disks are well-described by the general relativistic magnetohydrodynamics (GRMHD) equations of motion. By carrying out direct GRMHD simulations of tilted thin and thick disks, the project will obtain the first-principles understanding of disk physics in typical, tilted BH accretion systems. To surmount the prohibitively expensive nature of these simulations, the project has constructed the first GPU-accelerated GRMHD code, H-AMR, which is capable of adaptive mesh refinement and is ideally suited for the Blue Waters supercomputer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A liquid tightly confined between two solid surfaces at a gap spacing comparable to its molecular dimension can behave very different from its bulk state. Increased friction is commonly observed with confined liquids, often due to the solidification of the liquid when confined. Prior research of confined liquids has mostly focused on hard and well-structured confining walls. Yet many biological and engineering processes involve highly soft and deformable surfaces, such as lubrication between synovial and cartilaginous joints, motions of red blood cells in capillaries, and even the aquaplaning of rubbery tires. The impact of surface stiffness on fluid lubrication remains poorly understood. This grant supports fundamental research to understand the effect of surface stiffness on the structure and friction of strongly confined liquids, whose confining wall stiffness can be varied to be relevant of many real world systems. The knowledge gained from this investigation can be transformed to control fluid transport by optimizing surface mechanical elasticity and design low-friction interfaces for energy saving in various industrial applications. Broader impacts of this project will also include the recruitment and training of underrepresented students, including women students, as the next generation of American engineers. <br/><br/>This project addresses the long-debated questions of surface-induced glass transition and friction augment of spatially confined liquids. A quantitative understanding of the effect of surface stiffness on the dynamics of confined liquids between deformable surfaces will be developed by in-situ microscopic characterization at a single-particle level. The surface-to-liquid stiffness ratios will be tuned in a single microgel system by using microgel particles of varied crosslinking degrees as both surface coatings and confined liquids. A micron-gap tribometer integrated with confocal laser scanning microscopy enables the measurement of the heterogeneous dynamics and friction of confined microgel liquids between two deformable surfaces against varied gap spacings and shear conditions. The relationship among surface stiffness, confinement length scales, dynamic heterogeneity, and shear-induced fluidity of confined liquids will be quantified. The results obtained from this research will give molecular insight to confinement-induced glassy dynamics and biolubrication involving highly deformable surfaces. The success of this project can lead to a new avenue by judicious design and control of the mechanical compliance of surfaces and coatings to modify friction, facilitate interfacial mass transport, and manipulate surface sensing and actuation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Another notable feature of the North Atlantic seen in observations and models is the pronounced, spatially coherent, variability in the North Atlantic sea surface temperatures on decadal to multi-decadal timescales referred to as Atlantic Multidecadal Variability (AMV). With a typical periodicity of about 50 years, the AMV sea surface temperature (SST) variability impacts key climate characteristics, ranging from precipitation to tropical cyclone activity. The extent to which AMOC variability and the AMV are independent, and to which the latter reflects the former, remains hotly debated. One difficulty in resolving this debate is the short duration of available observations; another is that across the models, AMOC variability, including its periodicity, amplitude, and effect on SST, varies broadly. Accordingly, the main objective of this project is to establish the robust mechanisms of AMOC variability and its connection with the AMV, and at the same time to systematically explore the causes of these inter-model differences. This is of strong practical value as the AMOC is shown to be the most predictable component of the climate system on decadal timescales - progress in decadal prediction requires a better understanding of AMOC variability and its impacts. Funding from this grant will support the career growth of a female early career scientist, a graduate and undergraduate student and two postdoctoral associates. The project will enhance the climate modeling capacity by graduate and undergraduate students at both George Mason and Yale, and will facilitate the exchange of expertise between the two universities. This project will support several educational broader impacts including participation in GMU's Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship Program, benefiting high-school students and undergrads, public lectures and Teacher Development workshops at the Peabody Museum of Natural History.<br/><br/><br/>This is a modeling proposal to study decadal to multi-decadal variability of the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC) and its effect on climate in the North Atlantic, specifically on AMV, also referred to as the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO). The core approach lies in exciting or isolating AMOC internal modes and assessing their contribution to the AMV. The project will include several interrelated components: (i) Multi-decadal numerical experiments using several global climate models selected to represent inter-model differences in AMOC characteristics, in which we will excite AMOC variations by prescribing specifically chosen initial conditions - oceanic optimal initial perturbations in temperature or salinity. (ii) An analysis of the CMIP5 dataset focusing on AMOC internal modes and their effect on the AMV. (iii) A complementary analysis of an ocean eddy-resolving climate simulation. (iv) Observational analysis identifying periods of possible AMOC mode activity that we will then simulate with decadal reforecast experiments initialized by different ocean reanalysis products, thereby testing the impact of ocean state on the decadal evolution of the North Atlantic SST anomalies and the AMV. Throughout these analyses the properties of AMOC internal modes and the links between the AMOC and AMV will be assessed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Vascular plants include lycopods, ferns and their allies, as well as conifers and flowering plants. They form the foundation of nearly all terrestrial ecosystems and our food supply, yet scientists disagree about when and how they evolved. Current methods for estimating evolutionary timelines for these species have led to conflicting answers, as they rely on the ability of researchers to assign extinct fossil species correctly to particular branch points in the tree of life. This assignment is challenging to do because extinct species may have morphology that can be interpreted differently. Researchers will refine a new data analysis method to address this limitation. They will compare the DNA sequences of living vascular plants and incorporate morphological data from both living and extinct species to reconstruct their evolutionary relationships. During this process, researchers will apply new computer algorithms to estimate the evolutionary timeline for the species. Researchers will train undergraduate and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups, and support the professional development of an early-career researcher. They will educate the public about plant evolution by creating an interpretive exhibit at the University of California Berkeley and by producing a series of online video lessons for high school students and educators.<br/><br/>This project will develop a new total-evidence dating method to reconstruct the next-generation of time-calibrated phylogenetic hypotheses that incorporate both extinct and extant species. Researchers will leverage DNA sequence data collected by an existing NSF award to reconstruct a backbone phylogeny of ca. 300 extant vascular plants using nuclear genomic data. They will also collect morphological data for ca. 300 traits from these species as well as ca. 200 extinct fossil species. These data will be simultaneously integrated by the software program RevBayes to infer a time-calibrated phylogeny. This program combines sophisticated tree-shape priors, powerful models of morphological evolution, and recently developed methods for relaxing the molecular clock. Project outcomes will include a robust estimate of vascular plant divergence times and patterns of morphological evolution with an explicit measure of the full associated uncertainty of that estimate. The project will support research by sharing new and legacy morphological datasets in the online, open-access PROTEUS database and by hosting a training workshop focused on refining the theory and practice of divergence-time dating.

The hippocampus is a major component of the brain that plays an important role in memory and other major human functions.  This detailed computational model of the hippocampus will allow researchers to understand the origins of specific behavioral level features of the brain, as well as treatment effectiveness for conditions such as epilepsy.  In addition, the project aims to investigate brain changes under different radiation exposure regimes.  Furthermore, the software infrastructure developed in the project, as well as simulation results, will be publicly released to the wider neuroscience community.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the research projects is the construction of realistic and biophysically detailed computational models of the three major neuronal circuit layers in the hippocampus: the dentate gyrus (DG), CA3, and CA1. These three regions of the hippocampus are interconnected, and therefore the computational aspects of this research require building a detailed data-driven, full-scale computational model of the entire hippocampal formation and its inputs from the septum and the entorhinal cortex.  Information processing in the brain is organized and facilitated by the complex interactions of intrinsic biophysical properties of distinct neuronal types, neuronal morphology, and network connection topology. These properties give rise to specific types of network oscillations and other dynamic processes that govern neural information encoding and exchange. The hypotheses in this proposal are designed to create a detailed picture at unprecedented scale of how the intrinsic properties of hippocampal principal neurons and interneurons define the network activity under normal conditions, and how pathological changes in those properties under epileptic conditions disrupt hippocampal function.

For example, a VQA system could enable blind people to address daily visual challenges such as learning whether a pair of socks match or learning what type of food is in a can.  VQA services could also facilitate the creation of smarter environments, say to monitor how many defective products are on a factory assembly line at any given time.  A limitation of existing VQA systems is that they do not account for the fact that a visual question may elicit different answers from different people.  VQA systems could save time and reduce user frustration if they empowered users to anticipate and resolve any answer disagreements that may arise.  Blind and sighted people could more rapidly and accurately learn about the diversity of human perspectives on the visual world.  VQA services also could teach people how to ask visual questions that elicit the desired answer diversity.<br/><br/>This project will create artificial intelligence (AI) models that can account for the possible diversity of answers inherent in crowd intelligence.  Specifically, AI models will be designed to predict when, why, and how human answer disagreement occurs, which in turn will enable new designs for human-computer partnerships.  This is challenging because it necessitates designing frameworks that simultaneously model and synthesize different and potentially conflicting perceptions of images and language for the many possible causes of disagreement.  To ensure that the AI models generalize across a broad range of applications, an existing corpus of over one million visual questions asked by blind and sighted people will be used to create annotated datasets that indicate when, why, and how much answer disagreement arises.  Methods will then be developed for automatically predicting directly from a visual question how much answer diversity will arise from a crowd, and why disagreement arises when it does.  Finally, a system will be designed for guiding visually-impaired users to more quickly formulate visual questions so they can receive a single, unambiguous crowd response (e.g., guide the person to better frame the visual content of interest with a mobile phone camera).  User studies with blind users will be conducted to empirically test the efficacy of the new system, with a focus on uncovering human-based issues in real-world, real-time situations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Coeur d'Alene Tribe (CdAT), University of Idaho, and University of New Hampshire research alliance will recruit and work with middle school, high school, and undergraduate students from the CdAT Reservation in Idaho and other Tribal youth who attend University of Idaho, to develop high-quality audio documentaries focused on environmental decision-making processes.

While podcasts resonate strongly with the oral storytelling traditions of native American youth, they also provide a mechanism for conducting scientific inquiry. The project focuses on students learning about how to merge different knowledge systems (Western- mainstream/dominant science perspective, and Indigenous traditional knowledge) in order to become effective environmental decision-makers in the future. By investigating how community members resolve local environmental problems, students will be mentored by traditional and professional experts, and learn to utilize both STEM and cultural perspectives to solve environmental issues.  The project will develop and implement a unique, vertically integrated mentoring model where Native undergraduate students will be trained to mentor high school and middle school students, thereby helping middle school and high school students learn about pathways to college and other careers. <br/><br/>The V2H project will examine how people from Native American communities negotiate their Indigenous knowledge sources with Western science to make decisions in their everyday lives.

Project research will employ a mixed-methods design. The project will address several research questions: (1) What complex systems thinking attributes do students demonstrate? (2) How do students merge or negotiate different knowledge systems (Indigenous and Western)? (3) How do the students ethnic identity change through both audio documentary making and mentoring? (4) What aspects of complex thinking and integrating knowledge systems improve students attitudes toward traditional and non-traditional STEM topics? Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected and parallel data analysis will be implemented through the life of the project.  In order to understand what complex thinking attributes students demonstrate, the project will employ a pre- and post- modeling activity, using Mental Modeler, software that allows individuals to define components of a system and show the interconnectedness between the components of that system.

The goal of this CAREER project is to provide a way to control the amount of heat the surface of a space object radiates by changing the surface shape. Radiation of thermal energy affects surface temperature. Sun motion (e.g. orbit or daily solar cycles) results in a wide range of radiation conditions. This work will provide a way for a surface or component to respond to changes in the sun location and achieve a desired heating or cooling rate. An educational companion to the scientific objectives of this project is the creation of the Broadening Undergraduate Education in Science and Technology (BURST) Program to be implemented for the development of undergraduate researchers. Educational development activities for undergraduate classmen participating in the Spacecraft Group at BYU will culminate in the participation of BURST projects (undergraduate research) to assist students in the pursuit of a graduate education and provide a mechanism to explore the research project. Activities performed with students in the Spacecraft Group include outreach to underrepresented minority high school students by assisting with college preparation, K-12 STEM activities with low-income schools, and the creation of a website for access to data and instructional tools.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to provide dynamic control of radiative surface properties using origami-inspired surfaces. Actuation of origami can enable control of surface topography and corresponding cavity geometries to regulate net radiative heat transfer in response to changes in the radiative environment. Intrinsic radiative surface properties are static and therefore unable to adapt to changing thermal environments. Dynamically controlling the net radiative heat flux by controlling radiative properties would enable thermal management of surfaces where radiation is a dominant mode of heat exchange with the environment. Origami-inspired surfaces, comprised of tessellations (a tiled plane comprised of one or more geometric shapes), are able to provide an adaptable surface topography to modify the apparent radiative surface behavior. As the tessellations that comprise the unfolded surface collapse on each other during folding, deep grooves are formed which trap radiative energy due to the high-aspect ratio of the cavity. Controlling the cavity angle through mechanical actuation results in control of the degree of black-like behavior. To achieve the goal of providing thermal management through controllable radiative properties, the following objectives in the study of origami-inspired surfaces (e.g. Modified V-groove, Miura-ori, and Baretto Mars) will be pursued: 1) quantify and model emission of thermal radiation; 2) quantify and model absorption of thermal radiation; 3) predict and validate the net heat transfer rate at these surfaces; and 4) establish undergraduate research preparation through training activities that culminate in a research experience.

Examples of technology improving the specificity of animal data are acoustic recordings, camera-traps, radiotelemetry, and geolocators. These data have broadened our knowledge of where individual animals live and their movement patterns. In addition, relatively new technologies such as remote sensing from satellites and aircraft, and observation networks are providing large quantities of environmental data, such as rainfall, vegetation productivity, structure, connectivity and more at landscape and macrosystem scales that were not previously possible. These advances in technology, along with increased connectivity of internet users, have allowed a broader involvement of the public in collecting animal or environmental data. The challenge in many cases has been to link the animal-observations information, being collected by citizens, local groups, as well as national and international agencies, to relevant large-scale environmental datasets. This project addresses these issues in a workshop with experts that have helped advance the new technologies associated with animal detections and environmental data at landscape and macrosystem scales.<br/><br/>The explicitly inter-disciplinary nature of the workshop will foster linkages and collaborations that aim to alleviate technical barriers for scaling the information from animal observations to environmental datasets at macrosystem scales. Such barriers currently limit researchers from broadening the scale and scope of their research. There will be a two-day workshop that focuses on how new technologies and capabilities that investigate the distribution and movement of animals can be linked to environmental states and environmental changes at the landscape and macrosystem scales. The workshop will bring together experts in the fields of remote sensing and animal detection with the goal of integrating the various technologies and lay the foundation for a review paper on the potential of combined techniques to answer important questions in ecology and conservation biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Moura-Letts is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at Rowan University.  He is developing new classes of chemical reagents for the synthesis of nitrogen-containing molecules. These nitrogen-containing molecules are important for the construction of medicinally relevant natural products and can be found in several approved drugs. In spite of their importance, there remains a significant need for the development of short and selective methods to make these nitrogen-containing drug molecules. The goal of this research is to exploit the unique chemical properties of specific metal complexes that allow for the construction of a wide variety of nitrogen-containing molecules in a fashion previously unexplored. This project is also developing mechanisms to engage undergraduates, high school students, and returning veterans in chemical research. The goal is to stimulate their interest in scientific careers. <br/><br/>Metallooxaziridines are stable nitrogen-containing organometallic complexes that have the potential to efficiently promote the formation of three-membered ring heterocycles through the delivery of a nitrogen atom across pi-systems. To capitalize on this reactivity, three objectives are being pursued. 1) The reaction efficiency and scope of metallooxaziridine reactions with alkenes, aldehydes and imines for the synthesis of aziridines, oxaziridines and diaziridines respectively is being explored. 2) The reaction between pi-systems and metallooxaziridines are being studied in order to determine if the reactions can be run with using catalytic amount of the metal. 3) The potential for the reactions to be conducted in an asymmetric fashion are being investigated. In combination with these efforts, the work in connection with the educational plan is establishing a laboratory training system in which undergraduates and graduate students can receive a broad preparation in chemical synthesis along with research-training rotations in correlated areas of research. A plan to develop a science certificate program for returning Veterans is also being pursued in an effort to provide those individuals with a path to a productive career in the sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since the site's inception in 2006, students' commitment to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields has been demonstrated, as well as producing research publications. Students are provided with classroom training and gain hands-on experience using cutting-edge instruments, equipment, computers and cyberinfrastructure. Classes in computer programming and graphics, interface design, human-computer interaction, research skills, team skills, and ethics occupy approximately one third of the students' time. In an unusual structure that is focused on building a community of practice, students conduct interdisciplinary research projects in groups of two or three, with all students co-located in Iowa State's Virtual Reality Applications Center (VRAC). Each group interacts with VRAC graduate students under the supervision of VRAC faculty. The research projects are presented at an end-of-the summer campus-wide research symposium in the form of posters, demos, and a five-page research paper. Frequently the students present their research at research conferences later during the school year. <br/><br/>Two major trends are driving research in Emerging Interface Technologies (EIT): a dramatic increase of interface technologies themselves, and the ubiquitous permeation of technology into our everyday lives. Correspondingly, this research focuses on new interfaces that enhance people's perception, understanding of complexity, and work performance. The SPIRE exposes students to three broad areas of EIT: information visualization, virtual/augmented reality, human-agent interaction. In particular, previous projects have focused on improving cockpit sensor displays for pilots, the optimal use of emotional cues by intelligent agents during crisis situations in the International Space Station, use of virtual reality for improved drone navigation, use of augmented reality for reducing errors in factory assembly lines, reducing cyber sickness, improved user interfaces for faster traffic incident management, design tradeoffs of wearable biosensors and use of wireless electroencephalography (EEG) caps with people who have Parkinson's disease.

Hydrogels are a class of soft materials, composed of crosslinked polymeric networks that remarkably swell in water, which closely simulate many natural biological tissues, like mucous gel layers. Biological lubrication taking place in respiratory and gastrointestinal tracts, in the oral cavity and in the eyes, relies on the low friction coefficients provided by these mucous gel layers. Despite significant research effort, there is still disagreement about the origin of such low friction, which hinders the design of biomaterials capable of achieving efficient biolubrication to date. This project will thus deliver the needed knowledge of the relation between hydrogel's properties and frictional response. Thereby, it will enable to establish design principles of hydrogels for targeted biomedical applications capable of achieving low friction coefficients, and augmented wear resistance, and therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. society. This research involves several disciplines including materials chemistry and science, and tribology. The multi-disciplinary approach will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>In order to fill the outlined knowledge gap, two major lines of research will be followed: one comparing physically and chemically crosslinked hydrogels with a wide range of crosslinking degrees, and a second one that will study the influence of polymer chain semi-flexibility. To evaluate lubrication mechanisms, friction force measurements will be carried out on well-characterized hydrogels (with a wide range of compositions) by colloidal probe Atomic Force Microscopy and with a Surface Forces Apparatus as a function of load and sliding velocity (spanning over five orders of magnitude) to probe microscopic phenomena with different relaxation times. The experimental effort will provide insight into the effects of mesh size, type of crosslinking, polymer stiffness, as well as aging of the interface, on the frictional characteristics. The research team will also conduct dynamic shear-force measurements to scrutinize the relation between friction force and interfacial rheology of hydrogels. The knowledge generated by this research will afford to modulate the frictional response of hydrogels through the precise control of their microstructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The second part of the project investigates the computational power of the absence of entanglement in the context of quantum Merlin-Arthur protocols with two provers (QMA(2)). It is a well-motivated problem due to its connection to the separability problem within quantum information as well as the Unique Games Conjecture in the field of approximation algorithm. Specific objectives include the study of (1) the k-extendible states and de Finetti theorems for the separability problem and (2) non-trivial error reduction schemes of QMA(2).

The objective of this project is to bring innovations to mobile video delivery for new content types and over emerging networks. Specifically, the project investigates three aspects: (1) 360-degree immersive video delivery, (2) video streaming over multiple network paths (multipath), and (3) video streaming over millimeter-wave (mmWave) links. These are expected to be the key building blocks of next-generation video streaming services.  First, 360-degree videos provide users with unique panoramic viewing experience; however, 360-degree video content delivery is much more challenging compared to regular videos. Second, multiple network interfaces have become a norm on off-the-shelf mobile devices but their potential is far from being fully exploited. Third, mmWave is a key technology that will be integrated into 5G wireless networks; but adapting video streaming to mmWave largely remains an uncharted territory. The proposed solutions will benefit the society by enhancing the user experience and reducing the resource consumption for next-generation immersive video services. The research will also be integrated with an education plan that seeks to prepare computer science students with the knowledge of new technological trends in networking and systems, and stimulate the general public interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.<br/><br/>This project includes three inter-connected research thrusts. (1) For 360 video streaming, based on the concept of field-of-view (FoV) guided streaming, the project uses big data analytics to facilitate accurate head movement prediction, a key prerequisite for FoV-guided streaming. It also uses a rate adaptation scheme with a ""delta encoding"" design allowing the quality of a fetched chunk to be incrementally upgraded. This substantially improves adaptability when facing randomness in head movements. (2) For multipath streaming, the project uses multiple network interfaces to be used simultaneously for streaming videos. The network framework supports video rate adaptation and allows users to flexibly configure each path's cost. The framework also supports delay-sensitive live streaming over multipath through strategic packet scheduling. (3) mmWave links bear unique characteristics of massive capacity and intermittent availability. The project first designs a transport layer for mmWave links. It then proposes several video streaming strategies tailored to mmWave, such as strategically combining mmWave and legacy omni-directional radios.  For the above research thrusts, the project will develop algorithms, models, and systems, backed up by real implementation and evaluation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent development of inexpensive oxygen sensors have allowed the widespread collection of multi-year continuous records of oxygen concentration, which can be used to precisely measure the timing of respiration.  Organic matter may be produced in the stream by algae and other aquatic plants, or may be produced by terrestrial plants, and later be delivered to streams and rivers as falling leaves, as eroded particles of soil, or dissolved in water that flows from hillslopes to channels.  These organic matter sources support the growth of animals higher in the food chain, such as insects and fish, and also provide energy for microorganisms that remove pollutants. The balance of photosynthesis and respiration in streams also influences the production of greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide.  Because organic matter can enter streams in many different ways, and because different kinds of organic matter break down at different rates, the timing of energy supply to streams also is likely to differ among streams, and to respond to many different aspects of environmental change.  This award will support strengthen and broaden the scientific workforce by supporting participation of US scientists from different career stages, regions, and backgrounds in an international conference that addresses topics at the leading edge of environmental data science; will strengthen existing connections between US and international scientists and establish new ones; and will increase the use of a newly-developed online portal (StreamPULSE; data.streampulse.org) for storage, sharing, and analysis of stream photosynthesis and respiration data  to an international workshop to develop and test ideas about the connections between the timing of organic matter supply and the timing of its decomposition, and how environmental change may alter these patterns.<br/><br/>The aim of this conference is to simultaneously advance the conceptual and technical understanding of respiration and heterotrophy in streams and rivers.

Second, this conference will evaluate statistical methods to improve the estimation and interpretation of respiration dynamics from continuous time series of oxygen and other variables including carbon dioxide.

The meeting also embraces comparative approaches, using both non-model and model organisms, and laboratory as well as field studies. SRBR 2018, which has grown to attract over 700 attendees, focuses on the breadth of topics that represent key research areas in chronobiology, including molecular biology, genetics, cell biology, neurobiology, physiology, metabolism, behavior, sleep, and mathematical modeling. In particular, this award allows the meeting organizers to enhance meeting aspects directed towards trainee professional development as well as increasing attendance of underrepresented minorities and attendees from low-income countries. This is achieved by providing trainees and junior faculty with multiple professional development and mentoring opportunities (including our acclaimed full-day Professional Development Day). The organizers also stimulate attendance by underrepresented groups and researchers from low income countries via multiple initiative, including incentive funding and active inclusion of minorities in committees and scientific sessions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Paula Turkon, Sturt Manning, and Carol Griggs, along with colleagues from Mexico, will conduct research to provide a high-resolution absolute tree-ring chronology for Northern Mesoamerican archaeological sites using a combination of tree-ring and AMS radiocarbon data.  This project extends their preliminary research both geographically and chronologically, with the goal of linking the existing Epiclassic chronology from Northwestern Mesoamerica that ends in the 8th century A.D., to the regionally extensive, calendar-dated chronologies from living and relic trees in the same region. The dendrochronological results will offer dating precision to archaeologists working in these regions for time periods that do not have written sources of chronological data. It will also establish the foundation for climate reconstruction studies that, in the future, will help clarify the long-term relationships between the magnitude of climatic change and human response. In fostering close collaboration between archaeologists, dendrochronologists, graduate, and undergraduate students from multiple institutions throughout Mexico and the United States, this project's mission is to encourage the application of dendroarchaeology [=archaeological dendrochronology], currently not part of archaeological fieldwork or analysis in Mexico. <br/><br/>Mesoamerican archaeologists have long acknowledged the need for precise dating methods in order to understand cultural change, particularly in the region north of the core of Mesoamerican culture. Yet despite tremendous success in the development of tree-ring dating of archaeological sites just north in the American Southwest, and the more recent development of long tree-ring chronologies in Mexico that cover the past 1300 years, dendroarchaeology has been virtually absent in Mesoamerica. The first stage of this NSF funded project demonstrated the availability, measurability, and similarities in growth patterns (""crossdatability"") of archaeological tree-ring samples in Northwestern Mesoamerica from the 5th to 8th centuries A.D.  In this second stage, the researchers will incorporate archaeological samples from Postclassic and historic sites located in a broader geographic region in northern Mesoamerica. Because the new archaeological collections of wood will likewise be from a time period for which there are no well-established master chronologies, the tree-ring sequences produced from the prehispanic sites will be initially anchored in time by ""radiocarbon wiggle-matching.""   This method fits a known relative sequence of radiocarbon dates from specific tree-rings against the radiocarbon calibration curve to achieve a precise fit and thus calendar placement with minimal error.  Ultimately, we intend to create a continuous tree-ring record from the present back to the Classic period, using both the archaeological and historic collections, as well as existing calendar-dated chronologies.  The resulting data will not only fill a significant gap in our knowledge of the chronology of Northern Mesoamerica, but help address broader questions such as the rate, timing, and directionality of cultural influences with the Mesoamerican cultural core. Since dendroarchaeological methods are cumulative and iterative, the chronologies will gain in length, sample depth, and robustness, and will become increasingly useful to archaeologists working in broader geographic regions and time periods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nine years later, Ferdinand von Lindemann use Hermite's method to resolve the old problem that the number pi is transcendental. Hermite's tool was something we now call the Hermite-Padé approximant. His doctoral student Henri Padé studied a special case, a type of rational function that is now called the Padé approximant. These have turned out be a useful tool in problems as varied as scattering physics, numerical solution of differential equations, and rational approximation. Indeed, calculators still use rational approximations related to Padé approximants for calculating special functions. There are a great many unsolved problems about convergence of sequences of Padé approximants. One of the project goals  is to resolve some of these problems. Orthogonal polynomials turn out to be the denominator polynomials in certain Padé approximants, but are an even more important topic in their own right. They have applications in areas ranging from statistics to mathematical physics. <br/><br/>The specific goals of the project include investigating the notion of 'exact interpolation' for sequences of multipoint Padé approximants. The PI recently proved that when there is exact interpolation, namely no extra interpolation points, then subsequences or full sequences of Padé approximants converge uniformly in compact sets. The PI intends to establish explicit conditions for exact interpolation. On orthogonal polynomials, the PI recently discovered that universality limits for random matrices  can be turned into pointwise asymptotics for orthogonal polynomials at the endpoints of the interval of orthogonality. The PI intends to explore this in the bulk. On the flip side, the PI intends to use recent asymptotics of Eli Levin and the PI to establish universality limits for eigenvalues, as well as distribution of spacings of successive eigenvalues. Additional goals include establishing explicit formulae for Dirichlet orthogonal polynomials. The results will be disseminated in papers and at conferences. The PI recently co-organized a Computational Methods and Function Theory conference in Lublin, and will help co-organize the next one, most probably in Chile.

First, the fossils to be described are deposited in publicly accessible natural history collections, thereby ensuring that they are available in perpetuity to the scientific community. Second, student training programs developed around the preparation and analysis of the fossils provides valuable research and training for budding scientists. Third, results from this study will be published in scientific articles and presented at professional meetings and seminars for public audiences. And finally, by using the resources available at the Field Museum of Natural History in Chicago, the project will increase public understanding of science.

To realize these goals, the curriculum is designed to provide opportunities to undergraduate mathematics and science majors to work as part of a team on an interdisciplinary problem; read journal articles to gain some background on a new subject quickly; analyze open-ended problems using computer simulation as a discovery tool; and present a talk on their work at the end of the program and (optionally) at an appropriate research conference. Students are also encouraged to continue collaboration with mentors remotely, leading to publications in archival journals. The summer research will address problems related to weather prediction, atmospheric dynamics, aviation hazard analyses and forecasting; image processing and Fourier analysis; network dynamics and topology; and mathematical models of cancer (especially brain and prostate cancer). Students will be supervised by experienced faculty in their respective fields. By reaching out to community colleges, the program will tap into diverse talents from underrepresented minority groups and increase their research participation in mathematics and STEM fields.

These simulations will be of a very large scale, involving over 200 million atoms, and are expected to provide unprecedented insights into the mechanisms of influenza virulence and drug resistance.

However, influenza glycoproteins are components of a much larger virion surface that collectively participates in host recognition and infection processes.   The surface glycoprotein distributions and their decoration with glycans poses many interesting unanswered questions related to the roles of HA, NA, glycans, and substrate (and substrate mimicks) play in the viral infection and assembly process.  Additionally, the functional balance of HA, which binds to host-cell receptors, and NA, which abrogates receptor binding via cleavage of terminal sialic-acid residues, has not yet been fully characterized  The project request time to run two whole virion simulations: (1) H1N1 with glycans attached to key glycolysation sites on HA and NA and (2) with sialic acid bound in the sialic acid binding sites (mimicking a substrate bound complex). With the addition of the glycans and substrates, both systems will consist of over 200 million atoms.  The simulations will for the first time combine large-scale, subcellular / cellular level modeling at atomic detail with Markov state model theory; effectively aggregating the many copies of the individual glycoproteins into one statistics based network of states type model that enables it to extract long timescale dynamics from the short time scale simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Vascular plants include lycopods, ferns and their allies, as well as conifers and flowering plants. They form the foundation of nearly all terrestrial ecosystems and our food supply, yet scientists disagree about when and how they evolved. Current methods for estimating evolutionary timelines for these species have led to conflicting answers, as they rely on the ability of researchers to assign extinct fossil species correctly to particular branch points in the tree of life. This assignment is challenging to do because extinct species may have morphology that can be interpreted differently. Researchers will refine a new data analysis method to address this limitation. They will compare the DNA sequences of living vascular plants and incorporate morphological data from both living and extinct species to reconstruct their evolutionary relationships. During this process, researchers will apply new computer algorithms to estimate the evolutionary timeline for the species. Researchers will train undergraduate and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups, and support the professional development of an early-career researcher. They will educate the public about plant evolution by creating an interpretive exhibit at the University of California Berkeley and by producing a series of online video lessons for high school students and educators.<br/><br/>This project will develop a new total-evidence dating method to reconstruct the next-generation of time-calibrated phylogenetic hypotheses that incorporate both extinct and extant species. Researchers will leverage DNA sequence data collected by an existing NSF award to reconstruct a backbone phylogeny of ca. 300 extant vascular plants using nuclear genomic data. They will also collect morphological data for ca. 300 traits from these species as well as ca. 200 extinct fossil species. These data will be simultaneously integrated by the software program RevBayes to infer a time-calibrated phylogeny. This program combines sophisticated tree-shape priors, powerful models of morphological evolution, and recently developed methods for relaxing the molecular clock. Project outcomes will include a robust estimate of vascular plant divergence times and patterns of morphological evolution with an explicit measure of the full associated uncertainty of that estimate. The project will support research by sharing new and legacy morphological datasets in the online, open-access PROTEUS database and by hosting a training workshop focused on refining the theory and practice of divergence-time dating.

Currently, standard numerical simulation cannot match several key observational features of the IGM.  The mismatch between the simulations and observation data is much too large to be caused by observational errors, and is seen in multiple comparisons using different statistics, and by different groups. This project proposes to resolve this open question in astrophysics by running very high resolution simulations on the Blue Waters supercomputer to make more accurate and robust estimates of the IGM.  Furthermore, the simulations and codes will be publicly available to allow others to make their own estimates from existing or new observations.<br/><br/>The project will simulate the hydrogen Lyman alpha forest (LYAF) using the newly developed extreme scale branch of the Enzo called Enzo-P. Enzo-P implements the rich suite of physics models from the widely used Enzo community code on top of a new, highly scalable AMR infrastructure called Cello. Both Enzo-P and Cello have been developed by the PIs group at UCSD. The combination of Enzo-P and Cello will permit for the first time the use of AMR throughout a large cosmological volume, removing the existing tradeoff between large volume statistics and high local resolution that characterized previous Enzo simulations. The project will apply this new capability to carry out simulations of the LAF with sufficiently high resolution to capture the gaseous halos of galaxies which contribute significantly to intergalactic absorption, while at the same time surveying a statistically significant volume of the universe.  Moreover, the project will construct synthetic LYAF spectra and analyze their statistical properties to see whether the inclusion of high column density absorbers in the model improves agreement observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to Joule heating the overall electrical energy losses between power plants and consumers is in the range between 8 and 15%. A reduction of such enormous losses would be highly beneficial for society. Recently the principal investigator team has discovered that quantum properties of matter substantially affect Joule heating, that leads to a strong reduction of the energy losses. One of the main goals of this project is to reveal the mechanisms of the electrical energy dissipation in quantum electrical conductors. The proposed study of the temporal evolution of Joule heating may help realize this goal. The research results are of paramount importance for the design of novel energy-lossless electrical conductors utilizing the quantum properties of matter. The research is accomplished via direct participation of students of the City College of New York, which is a federally recognized minority serving institution.  The activity has great impact on these students, providing training and education in advanced areas of quantum physics and material science.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT:<br/>Joule heating is a remarkable physical phenomenon, which transforms electric energy into heat. Recently it was shown that the quantum properties of matter significantly affect this heating, giving rise to a thermal stratification (quantization) of the electron distribution in the energy space. This effect, called quantal heating, does not exist in classical electron systems. In contrast to classical Joule heating, quantal heating leads to outstanding nonlinear transport properties of highly mobile 2D electrons, driving them into exotic nonlinear states in which voltage does not depend on current and vice versa. This project is the original study of the dynamics of quantal heating and the exotic nonlinear states in highly mobile 2D electron systems placed in quantizing magnetic fields. The research includes investigations of fundamental mechanisms of the nonlinear response: spectral diffusion, spatial electron redistribution and inelastic electron relaxation in different regimes including the dc-driven exotic nonlinear states of 2D electrons and Quantum Hall Effect. Investigations of nonlinear electron transport at half-integer filling factors are focused on the search for quantal heating and nonlinear states of composite fermions in response to dc bias. The project reveals the important role of quantum effects in the transfer of electric energy into heat. The research is accomplished via direct participation of students of the City College of New York, which is a federally recognized minority serving institution.

The research goal of this project is to build and optimize an innovative electrode array device that will improve the resolution of brain interface devices by more than 1000-fold.  This goal is now considered possible due to the PI?s breakthrough success in developing electronics that can support more than 650 electrodes with a single wire.  The array, which can both record brain activity and stimulate the brain, will enable research into the subtle brain signals that generate seizures in people with epilepsy and unlock new treatment options.  The technology will also dramatically improve the performance of motor prosthetic devices for the paralyzed, visual prosthetic devices for the blind, and facilitate new treatments for other neurological disorders.  The educational goal is to engage students and teachers in understanding brain-machine interfaces and increase interest among students in pursuing STEM undergraduate degrees and careers. In collaboration with several local high schools, a high-school written science module on neuroengineering, meeting state and national science standards, will be created. The PI will develop materials for high school biology and physics teachers to introduce the field of neuroengineering with a hands-on laboratory exercise. The PI will host an annual workshop for 20 science teachers from around the state to introduce the field of neuroengineering and to give the teachers a chance to try out the lab materials.<br/><br/>The project's research objective, driven by the PI's recent breakthrough development of active, flexible electronics that will enable implanted neural interfaces in which greater than 65,000 electrodes can be sampled using fewer than 100 wires, is to advance and optimize these brain interfaces by measuring fundamental neural interface design parameters. These design parameters critically influence the signal to noise ratio, total information content, and long-term reliability of electrode implants. Leveraging both computational models and experimental results related to audio responses in rats and comparisons to nonhuman primate data made available by a collaborator, three aspects critical to the performance of neural interface devices will be investigated: 1) electrode material and contact size, 2) electrode spacing, and 3) array geometry. The implant design uses the same electronics that permit a digital camera to have millions of pixels without millions of wires and will improve the resolution of brain interface devices by more than 1000-fold. The Research Plan is organized under 3 objectives: 1) Measure the effect of cortical surface contact size, material, and impedance on the properties of the recorded neural signals, including the recording of action potentials (APs); 2) Determine the surface electrode spacing required to satisfy Nyquist-Shannon spatial sampling by measuring the information content of neural signals from varying length scales and 3) Understand the biological and non-biological factors that influence the long-term reliability of surface electrode arrays by chronically implanting surface electrode arrays in freely behaving rats and evaluating long-term function and biocompatibility. The project's educational objective, to create a high-school science module, involves development and dissemination of curricular resources and a lab exercise using Arduino microcontrollers that will allow students to record and display their own electromyographic(EMG) signals and use them to control a video game.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

JMU faculty members provide research opportunities in all major sub-disciplines of chemistry, with expertise centered in synthesis, biophysical chemistry and materials. In addition, students participate in a series of professional development activities aimed at enhancing effective science communication with other chemists, scientists in other disciplines, the public, and those with communication disorders (e.g. deaf and hard-of-hearing). Participants include students and faculty from JMU and outside institutions that serve deaf students or institutions that do not have extensive research infrastructure. By involving students in all aspects of the research process, from experimental design to dissemination of results, this program aims to lower the barriers, particularly for D/HH students, that hinder the pursuit of graduate studies in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The JMU Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry provides research opportunities for D/HH students and faculty. The students participate in a variety of research projects. Some examples include: the hydrogenation of carbon monoxide to formaldehyde, the development of hybrid materials for photovoltaic applications, and the use of molecular dynamics to elucidate the mechanisms of the binding of ubiquitin to its substrate protein. D/HH participants are supported with professional American Sign Language (ASL) interpreters and student interpreters in both professional and social settings. This immersive experience provides interpreting students the opportunity to learn and work in a science environment with the goal of developing professional interpreters with experience in the laboratory. In addition to the full-time student interpreters, additional ASL-interpreting students are invited to campus to observe the REU program for one week. The incorporation of these students expands the impact of the program by exposing a larger number of interpreting students to the challenges and opportunities involved in deaf communication in chemistry laboratories. All REU hearing participants, including faculty and students from outside colleges and universities, benefit from interactions with D/HH students and faculty, as hearing participants gain an appreciation for the challenges and opportunities associated with the inclusion of persons with disabilities.

Recent progress in nanotechnology has reduced the size of silicon transistors down to the order of 10 nanometers. For such small transistors, other physical effects set in, limiting the functionality of the transistors. Novel materials and device concepts are required. Recently, a group of materials called Heusler alloys has been theoretically predicted to be promising for applications. These materials are ferromagnetic and expected to host a new type of massless fundamental particles discovered recently in solid materials, called Weyl fermions. This effort will provide experimental evidence for such exotic states in Heusler alloys. If successful, it would not only advance the knowledge of topological Weyl semimetals, but also likely lead to applications in spintronics.

However, ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals have not been experimentally realized yet, though they were predicted to have more exciting properties, e.g. quantum anomalous Hall effect in monolayer ferromagnetic Weyl semimetal. There have been considerable theoretical efforts in predicting ferromagnetic Weyl semimetals and many candidate materials have been proposed. The major objective of this proposed research is to experimentally verify one recently-predicted candidate material system, i.e. Heusler alloy Co2XZ(X=V, Zr, Nb, Ti, Mn, Hf; Z =Si, Ge, Sn, Ga and Al). The principal investigators of this project grow single crystals of various members of the Co2XZ family using the floating-zone, metal flux and chemical vapor transport methods and seek transport and spectroscopic evidences of Weyl fermions in these materials through magneto-transport, Hall effect, quantum oscillation and photoemission spectroscopy experiments. In addition, the principal investigators also study the Weyl states driven by a magnetic field in several half Heusler alloy systems ReMX (Re= rare earth, MX=PdBi and PtSb). The goal of this part of research is to find more field-driven Weyl semimetal states, which could be used as a platform to verify the proposed mechanisms for the field-driven Weyl state and study the dependence of Weyl state on spin-orbital coupling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ionomers in an energy conversion device (such as hydrogen fuel cell) allow conduction of ions and generation of electricity. Utilizing hydrogen fuel cells can greatly benefit the environment since it does not emit any harmful gas (such as carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide) while generating electricity. However, such an eco-friendly technology is not economically viable due to the expensive ionomers and catalysts used. Also there is much data available on ionomer behavior in thick (several tens of micron thick) materials, but it is still not very well understood how ionomers behave in very thin (less than a micron thick) materials. Thin ionomer layers suffer from poor ion conductivity which negatively impacts the performance of energy conversion and storage devices. Without a sound understanding of nanoscale properties of ionomers at catalyst interfaces, more efficient, next-generation ion conducting materials cannot be designed. To address these needs, this project will systematically study how proton conducting ionomers interact with low-cost catalysts (with lower content of precious metals) and how those interactions impact the ion conduction environment in nanothin films. This understanding will lead a chemical synthesis effort to design new ionomers that can improve ion conductivity in thinner materials.  This project will address technical challenges in understanding polymers at nanoscale and advance the existing knowledge. It will contribute to potentially making eco-friendly hydrogen fuel cells more efficient and cheaper; aid improvement of other energy conversion and storage devices (e.g. batteries, supercapacitors); and improve the quality of life.   This work will also contribute to educating and training students (including women and underrepresented minorities) at all levels in STEM areas and inspire them toward technologically and societally important careers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>As the future demand for thinner energy conversion and storage device continually increases, ionomer confinement and interfacial phenomena studies continue to become more important. Ionomers behave very differently under thin film confinement (e.g. at ionomer-catalyst thin interfaces) as compared to bulk membranes. Nanoscale ion conduction behavior determines the energy efficiency of fuel cell based devices. The project aims to systematically probe the impact of gradual changes in ionomer confinement and distinguish the ion conduction behavior of nanoconfined and bulk materials as a function of ionomeric material thickness, ionomer structure, nature of catalyst, and hydration. Ionomer-catalyst-water interactions and characteristics of local hydration environment will be qualitatively explored in sub-micron thick films of an array of proton exchanging ionomers over low-Platinum group metal (low-PGM) catalyst layers. By combining the qualitative picture of nanoscale ion conduction environment with quantitative values of proton conductivity, a true insight into interfacial proton conduction will be obtained.  Depth profile imaging of ionomeric materials (upon incorporation of ratiometric fluorescent probes) will offer information about distribution of properties (such as proton concentration profile) across the thickness of materials. Since the issues associated with thin ionomer films (confinement, interfacial interactions, ill-connected ionic domains, poor proton conductivity) are different from bulk membranes, a new range of ionomers will be chemically synthesized aiming to improve proton conduction in confined systems. The presence of macrocyclic moieties within ionomer structure will allow the formation of pores and ion conducting channels with controlled diameter, which will offer additional proton conduction pathways and facilitate proton conduction in nanothin ionomer films. The project's educational objectives are to: 1) prepare a diverse, future energy workforce by educating and inspiring middle school, high school, undergraduate and graduate students and post-doctoral researchers, and 2) contribute to public awareness and societal behavior regarding sustainable energy through outreach for families and adults.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Paula Turkon, Sturt Manning, and Carol Griggs, along with colleagues from Mexico, will conduct research to provide a high-resolution absolute tree-ring chronology for Northern Mesoamerican archaeological sites using a combination of tree-ring and AMS radiocarbon data.  This project extends their preliminary research both geographically and chronologically, with the goal of linking the existing Epiclassic chronology from Northwestern Mesoamerica that ends in the 8th century A.D., to the regionally extensive, calendar-dated chronologies from living and relic trees in the same region. The dendrochronological results will offer dating precision to archaeologists working in these regions for time periods that do not have written sources of chronological data. It will also establish the foundation for climate reconstruction studies that, in the future, will help clarify the long-term relationships between the magnitude of climatic change and human response. In fostering close collaboration between archaeologists, dendrochronologists, graduate, and undergraduate students from multiple institutions throughout Mexico and the United States, this project's mission is to encourage the application of dendroarchaeology [=archaeological dendrochronology], currently not part of archaeological fieldwork or analysis in Mexico. <br/><br/>Mesoamerican archaeologists have long acknowledged the need for precise dating methods in order to understand cultural change, particularly in the region north of the core of Mesoamerican culture. Yet despite tremendous success in the development of tree-ring dating of archaeological sites just north in the American Southwest, and the more recent development of long tree-ring chronologies in Mexico that cover the past 1300 years, dendroarchaeology has been virtually absent in Mesoamerica. The first stage of this NSF funded project demonstrated the availability, measurability, and similarities in growth patterns (""crossdatability"") of archaeological tree-ring samples in Northwestern Mesoamerica from the 5th to 8th centuries A.D.  In this second stage, the researchers will incorporate archaeological samples from Postclassic and historic sites located in a broader geographic region in northern Mesoamerica. Because the new archaeological collections of wood will likewise be from a time period for which there are no well-established master chronologies, the tree-ring sequences produced from the prehispanic sites will be initially anchored in time by ""radiocarbon wiggle-matching.""   This method fits a known relative sequence of radiocarbon dates from specific tree-rings against the radiocarbon calibration curve to achieve a precise fit and thus calendar placement with minimal error.  Ultimately, we intend to create a continuous tree-ring record from the present back to the Classic period, using both the archaeological and historic collections, as well as existing calendar-dated chronologies.  The resulting data will not only fill a significant gap in our knowledge of the chronology of Northern Mesoamerica, but help address broader questions such as the rate, timing, and directionality of cultural influences with the Mesoamerican cultural core. Since dendroarchaeological methods are cumulative and iterative, the chronologies will gain in length, sample depth, and robustness, and will become increasingly useful to archaeologists working in broader geographic regions and time periods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using a variety of methods, the doctoral student will reconstruct and compare fire-climate-vegetation dynamics of the past century to those that have occurred over the past millennium.  The results of this project will reveal whether once-forested but now peat-accumulating sites are novel ecosystems, or whether such transitions have occurred in the past in these regions, possible due to drought conditions and fire frequencies that are similar to those observed today.  These results are of interest to land managers, who require tools to determine how best to manage altered ecosystems. By identifying whether (and which) ecological thresholds have been crossed, this project will provide crucial input for decision-making regarding best practices for land management.  The doctoral student will work closely with regional land managers and other stakeholders, including land owners and educators, to ensure that project results are available to inform collaborative land use decisions.  The PIs will also engage K-12 and college students in hands-on fieldwork, thus preparing future scientists to employ multiple lines of evidence in investigating the causes and consequences of environmental change.  In addition, as a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will provide support to enable a promising graduate student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>The overarching objective of this doctoral dissertation improvement project is to contribute to the scientific literature on alternative stable states that result from changes in the fire regimes of forested ecosystems.  Using methods from paleoecology, dendroecology, and community ecology, this research will examine fire-mediated effects on ecosystem structure at varying spatiotemporal scales at the peatland-forest ecotone, a transition zone that, like tree line, is particularly sensitive to changes in fire and climate.  The project addresses the following questions: (1) How has fire activity during post-European settlement periods with distinct climate conditions differed quantitatively from that of pre-settlement conditions?  (2) How has fire impacted the vegetation community of the forest-peatland ecotone during the most recent extreme warm/dry and cool/wet periods?  (3) What are the mechanisms that favor a transition from forested to peat-accumulating lands in a site?  Specifically, the doctoral student will use tree-ring fire scar dates, forest stand structure reconstructions, and sedimentary records to answer these questions.  In addition, surveys of present-day vegetation composition/structure at control and burned sites will be paired with those of abiotic and biotic factors to uncover the mechanisms underlying the persistence of the peat-accumulating state.  Although this project will focus on the forest-peatland ecotone of southwestern Patagonia, the research will provide new insights and approaches for dealing with the interactive effects of environmental change in many other regions, including some in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Catalytic reactions and processes with inexpensive and widely-available metals metals, simple substrates and reagents, and generation of benign by-products will serve this need. In this project, Dr. Dave Martin is developing new light-driven reactions with a novel cobalt-based catalyst that converts simple chemicals into a host of useful products. This approach is leveraging cheap, abundant feedstocks such as biomass. New insights into the mechanism of these reactions are also being learned. Sharing these new developments with undergraduate students at UC Riverside promotes green chemistry values as a part of a larger effort to increase research participation and scientific engagement.

The use of abundant cobalt-based catalysts inspired by the biochemistry of vitamin B12 provides an alternative mechanism for in situ activation and generates versatile radical intermediates that can participate in a wide variety of chemical transformations including catalytic deoxygenation, radical cyclizations and intermolecular cross-coupling. Direct alcohol coupling processes leverage readily available feedstock chemicals from conventional sources and also provide a powerful means for the valorization of renewable sources such as sugars and lignin biomass. The mechanisms of stoichiometric and catalytic pathways are being studied to provide a deeper understanding of the interaction of Co(II) complexes with radical intermediates under photochemical conditions.

How and why do complex organs, like eyes, evolve?  These phenomena happen on time scales much longer than our lives, making it difficult for us to understand how they happened.  Species are defined by being distinct from and not breeding with each other.  Not interbreeding could be a simple matter of when, where or who you choose to mate with.  It could also be caused by a failure to produce offspring that can survive and reproduce.  Species today are often kept separate from one another by multiple mechanisms, so we do not know how they evolved in the first place.  Likewise, complex organs are like machines with many parts that must all be present and well integrated if the machine is to work, but how did this complexity arise?  In each case, nature most often presents us with end products without any clues about how they came about; however, sometimes nature provides groups of species that retain enough clues to these processes for one to be able to study how they occur, as in the case of this research program.   One impact of this work pertains to the complex organ that is studied.  These investigators are studying the evolution of placentas and are doing so in a context in which they can compare species with placentas with close relatives who lack placentas or have less complex placentas.  This diversity enables them to address the consequences of having a placenta, including how it affects fertility. The research will enhance the training of students at multiple levels (high school, college, and post-graduate) as well as provide outreach to the public.<br/><br/>The proposed research combines work done at two levels of resolution. First, the investigators will work on all species in the fish family Poeciliidae, enabling them to define the timing and order of evolutionary changes.   Second, they will perform experiments on individual species within the family to characterize the mechanisms that cause evolution. They will sequence whole genomes then use the DNA sequences to reconstruct the family tree.  They will characterize the biology of every species on the tree, including how females provision their young and how males and females choose who to mate with.  These fish all bear live young, but some fully provision eggs before they are fertilized while others continue to provision eggs after fertilization.  The latter group has the functional equivalent of a mammalian placenta, but species vary in how well the placenta is developed and how much they provision young during development.  Species also differ in how they choose mates, with some having males with elaborate ornamentation and courtship displays and others with no sex differences in coloration and no courtship.  The integration of biology with the family tree is what will enable the investigators to infer when and in what order female provisioning and aspects of mate choice evolved.  It is also possible to test whether the evolution of certain traits is associated with an acceleration or deceleration of how fast new species are formed.  It will then be possible to test predictions derived from evolutionary theory for how the evolution of these traits are inter-related with one another.  The family tree also enables the investigators to identify closely related species that differ in the presence or absence of placentas.  These species pairs become the subjects of experiments in which they will perform more detailed studies of the biology of reproductive isolation, including assessments of multiple mating and the rate of evolution of reproductive isolation.  The integration of work done at both levels will enable the investigators to detail how mating systems and mode of reproduction affect the evolution of reproductive isolation, how these different facets of speciation have interacted to shape the evolution of species in the family and how they affect the rate of speciation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The aim of this workshop is to use this evidence to help build a comprehensive, place-based science. Broadly speaking, a place-based science of lifespan development will recognize that different residential neighborhoods and activity spaces might expose children, youth, and families to different resources and risks. These differences have important implications for development. In addition, there is a critical need to incorporate transdisciplinary perspectives on race, ethnicity, and culture to advance a place-based science that is relevant and meaningful for an increasingly diverse U.S. society. This workshop will enhance the theoretical and conceptual frameworks that will support future place-based research on development across the lifespan. Such research can address important societal issues related to segregation, inequality, and positive development.<br/><br/>This workshop will allow a group of scholars to work together to (1) integrate existing theoretical foundations of neighborhood and activity space research and (2) critically analyze how these theoretical foundations can incorporate scientific evidence that has documented racial, ethnic, and cultural diversity in developmental processes across the lifespan. Additionally, workshop participants will advance a set of recommendations on innovative, dynamic, multi-level approaches that reflect theoretical and conceptual advances made in the workshop.

NMR is a powerful technique for determining the structure of molecules, including bond angles and distances not available through any other technique.  Dr. Casabianca's work is important for understanding how nanoparticles behave when they enter the body, which is increasingly relevant as the use of nanoparticles in medicine and consumer products increases.

The integrated educational aims of this work seek to increase the number of female and minority students in South Carolina who are excited about using computer science to solve problems in chemistry. This is being addressed by developing an undergraduate computational chemistry course, introducing computer programming into the junior-level quantum mechanics course, and creating fun and exciting lessons incorporating MRI and computer science for summer camps for middle-school girls.<br/><br/>NMR is not ideally suited for surface studies due to its low sensitivity.

It strengthens by drawing thermal energy from the underlying warm ocean but weakens due to the drag of rough ocean surface. These processes change dramatically as the wind speed increases above 30 m/s. The air-sea momentum flux at hurricane winds is still poorly understood, which severely affects the capability of forecasting the path and intensity of tropical cyclones. Ocean surface waves undoubtedly play a central role, but sea spray plays an increasingly important role. This project addresses this challenging problem by analyzing field measurements (surface wave spectra, underwater ambient sound, wind, etc.) in three tropical cyclones and stress calculated using an ocean momentum budget. The analyses are guided by the state-of-the-art UWIN-CM (the University of Miami Unified Wave INterface Coupled Atmosphere-Wave-Ocean Model) simulations. Variations in wave stress and breaking rate as a function of wind speed and directional wave properties will be investigated by comparisons with the UWIN-CM simulations and by analyses of the modeled wave dissipation function. Knowledge acquired in this project will improve the understanding and forecasting of hurricanes and will directly benefit the public. In addition, poor understanding of hurricanes is partly due to the lack of reliable measuring techniques in the harsh hurricane condition. This project will develop the underwater Lagrangian and acoustic techniques, which are able to monitor the air-sea interface from the beneath. A user-interface designed movie will be created to display how scientists observe hurricanes using different techniques, such as satellites, aircrafts, and underwater instruments. The movie will be played to visiting children, in science talks, in local schools and on the Internet.<br/><br/>By combining the unique field measurements and state-of-the-art UWIN-CM simulations, we will answer the following scientific questions: (1) How important are equilibrium-range waves in controlling the air-sea momentum flux in tropical cyclones? We hypothesize that for wind speeds higher than 30 m/s the stress on the ocean surface is larger than the equilibrium-range wave breaking stress. (2) How does the wave breaking rate vary with wind speed and the complex surface wave field? At moderate wind speeds the wave breaking rate increases with increasing speed. Does this continue at extreme high winds? (3) Can we detect acoustic signatures of sea spray at high winds? Measurements of sea spray in tropical cyclones are very rare. We will seek for the acoustic signatures of spray droplets impacting the ocean surface. (4) What are the processes controlling the air-sea momentum flux?

Recent experimental advances in laser physics have enabled the control of electrons in materials at ultrafast time scales, before they can equilibrate. Likewise, the production of ultracold gases of atoms that are well isolated from their surroundings has enabled the real-time observation of their quantum dynamics. These developments have opened up a new regime of inquiry within quantum mechanics. This research seeks to elucidate complex quantum dynamics in specific settings.<br/><br/>The most unexpected discovery in this context is that even extremely energetic quantum particles can remain spatially localized under a broad range of experimental conditions. This is in striking contrast with usual intuition from classical mechanics: if one rapidly shakes a box full of marbles, they do not stay still. When quantum particles localize, not only do they stay still, but they also become potentially usable for controlled quantum computation. The project aims to clarify the precise conditions under which this localization arises, determine near-term experimental observables, and build towards a complete theory of this poorly understood phenomenon. <br/><br/>On driving the support of a simple pendulum quickly, the effects of gravity can be undone: the pendulum bob can settle in the inverted position above the point of support. Recent experiments in electronic systems suggest that strong laser radiation can similarly stabilize exotic quantum effects, such as superconductivity at short times, in materials which do not normally superconduct. Another aim of the project is to develop a theory of such dynamically stabilized states so as to control and engineer them for computation and other applications.<br/><br/>In addition to mentoring and training graduate and undergraduate students participating in the research program, the PI aims to inspire local middle- and high-school students to explore careers in STEM through ""Physics days"" involving lab tours, demonstrations, and faculty interactions.

Through a multipronged approach that includes studies in model systems, developing general theorems about quantum steady states, perturbation theory and numerical computation, this project proposes to address the following fundamental issues:<br/><br/>1) Strong quenched disorder can indefinitely prevent local equilibration in a well-isolated system, a remarkable phenomenon known as many-body localization. The PI will investigate foundational aspects of many-body localization in higher dimensions, in quasiperiodic settings, and the interplay of localization and topology.<br/><br/>2) Exotic nonequilibrium orders with no equilibrium counterpart can arise in driven quantum systems, offering a unique window into robust quantum coherent many-body phenomena. The PI will discover and classify the complex orders accessible with multitone driving and investigate their stability.<br/><br/>3) Environmental properties are crucial in state preparation and stabilizing fragile topological states. The PI will investigate the properties of unconventional environments, including anyon baths and baths with memory in experimentally relevant systems and extract their universal features.<br/><br/>Remarkable experimental advances in the past decade in the ultrafast spectroscopy of correlated materials and in the construction of well-isolated ultracold atomic and molecular gases have brought real-time dynamics of many-body quantum systems into sharp focus. Concurrently, the quest to build a quantum computer in experimental platforms like superconducting qubits and trapped ions has raised many interesting questions about coherence in driven dissipative systems and has led to a rich exchange of ideas between quantum information theory and condensed matter. Theoretically, the understanding of far-from-equilibrium systems remains challenging because the assumptions underlying statistical mechanics typically fail to apply. The proposed research seeks to broadly advance our understanding of quantum many-body dynamics in closed, driven, and open settings, and to specifically apply it to the observation of novel quantum orders in dynamical settings. The development of new computational methods and the understanding of microscopic time scales in realistic experimental systems will also be a priority.<br/><br/>In addition to mentoring and training graduate and undergraduate students participating in the research program, the PI aims to inspire local middle- and high-school students to explore careers in STEM through ""Physics days"" involving lab tours, demonstrations, and faculty interactions.

Vascular plants include lycopods, ferns and their allies, as well as conifers and flowering plants. They form the foundation of nearly all terrestrial ecosystems and our food supply, yet scientists disagree about when and how they evolved. Current methods for estimating evolutionary timelines for these species have led to conflicting answers, as they rely on the ability of researchers to assign extinct fossil species correctly to particular branch points in the tree of life. This assignment is challenging to do because extinct species may have morphology that can be interpreted differently. Researchers will refine a new data analysis method to address this limitation. They will compare the DNA sequences of living vascular plants and incorporate morphological data from both living and extinct species to reconstruct their evolutionary relationships. During this process, researchers will apply new computer algorithms to estimate the evolutionary timeline for the species. Researchers will train undergraduate and graduate students, including members of under-represented groups, and support the professional development of an early-career researcher. They will educate the public about plant evolution by creating an interpretive exhibit at the University of California Berkeley and by producing a series of online video lessons for high school students and educators.<br/><br/>This project will develop a new total-evidence dating method to reconstruct the next generation of time-calibrated phylogenetic hypotheses that incorporate both extinct and extant species. Researchers will leverage DNA sequence data collected by an existing NSF award to reconstruct a backbone phylogeny of ca. 300 extant vascular plants using nuclear genomic data. They will also collect morphological data for ca. 300 traits from these species as well as ca. 200 extinct fossil species. These data will be simultaneously integrated by the software program RevBayes to infer a time-calibrated phylogeny. This program combines sophisticated tree-shape priors, powerful models of morphological evolution, and recently developed methods for relaxing the molecular clock. Project outcomes will include a robust estimate of vascular plant divergence times and patterns of morphological evolution with an explicit measure of the full associated uncertainty of that estimate. The project will support research by sharing new and legacy morphological datasets in the online, open-access PROTEUS database and by hosting a training workshop focused on refining the theory and practice of divergence-time dating. Research will strengthen collaborations among US and international scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims to prepare and support 29 engineering and mathematics majors in the university's accredited Engineering Education and Mathematics Education programs. Pre-service teachers in these programs will complete secondary teacher licensure requirements for grades 7 - 12 and leave the program prepared to teach engineering and/or mathematics in secondary high-need schools in Ohio. Additionally, these Noyce scholars will participate in professional training and immersive experiences related to diversity and cultural awareness. Successful implementation of this Noyce project has the potential to positively affect engineering and mathematics educators statewide and to strengthen partnerships with area K-12 schools. The project will result in the creation of a new Engineering Education Certificate. <br/><br/>This five-year project aims to increase the number of engineering and mathematics graduates at Ohio Northern University who are certified to teach mathematics and/or engineering. The project will offer multidisciplinary coursework, engineering and mathematics education cross-instructional preparation, cultural responsiveness training, peer mentoring, and immersive field experiences in urban and rural settings. Scholar recruitment activities will leverage high-impact experiential learning opportunities. These opportunities will include outreach events held at area K-12 schools, STEM-focused summer camps, university-supported internships, faculty-advised research, and a five-day intensive urban teaching experience. Noyce scholars will be prepared to use a constructionist approach to inductive learning, guided inquiry, and project-based learning. The project aims to produce educators with increased competencies in teaching and learning strategies aligned with the national science and mathematics education standards.

The project will use the high performance computing capabilities of Blue Waters to produce high-resolution, high-quality, time-dependent, and openly distributed digital elevation models (DEMs) for the Earth's poles. This data set is needed for measuring and understanding rapid, ongoing changes to the polar landscapes, as well as for impact mitigation and adaptation planning by polar communities.

These satellites images allow for precise stereo photogrammetric DEM construction from overlapping image pairs over a wide range of terrain types and light conditions, including the ""flat white"" interior of ice sheets and shadowed mountain faces. The time-dependent collection of DEMs will be invaluable to scientists studying change in the polar region.   Resources for obtaining and maintaining the imagery, tools for post-processing the results, software development time, and methods for distributing the DEMs have been secured by the project.

Hydrogel materials are already used for soft contact lenses and biomedical coatings (for example for prosthetics) because they are water-permeable, biocompatible, and compliant. However, their surface slip behavior does not yet have clear design rules because of their hydrated nature and broad ability to tune the composition. This award will allow for highly-qualified students to examine the mechanisms of slip, and to combine their findings into more concrete design rules for these hydrogel surfaces. This requires them to draw from several disciplines including materials science, mechanical engineering, surface science, and even biomechanics. This work will allow for the recruitment and encouragement of underrepresented groups in engineering. The PI will participate in two ongoing summer camps for underrepresented K-12 students and will enlarge the curricula of these camps by bringing in women engineers from industry to lead educational events based on the science of lubrication. Specific interactions will be focused on highlighting the personal experiences of the industry leaders to encourage the camp participants to pursue STEM careers. The PI will also leverage large undergraduate course activities, in particular design experiences, to expose students to successful undergraduate and graduate research. The fundamental results are anticipated to promote scientific progress and advance the national health. <br/><br/>In humans, cartilage layers provide both robust lubrication and mechanical damping, among chemical and biological functions. The mechanics of energy dissipation in hydrated soft surfaces, especially under contact and slip, have not been sorted out, and thus there is no way to currently engineer the lubrication behavior required for prosthetic devices which support load and control slip. This work examines reigning theories as to their ability to account for energy dissipation under slip, including fluid load support, viscoelastic relaxation, and fluid shear. Experiments on mechanical deformation and contact will prove or disprove the hallmarks of different mechanisms, such as the pressure-dependence on friction coefficient. The material composition will also be varied, and the results will be assembled into guiding design principles for soft hydrated surfaces. Complementary to the research goal of this work is the educational goal of increasing the diversity of STEM professionals in Illinois and the U.S by collaborating with industry on high school outreach activities and leveraging large undergraduate course activities for exposure to research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Voices to Hear (V2H) will use the oral tradition of storytelling to empower Native American students (middle school, high school and college) to engage in environmental decision-making and scientific communication, while building a stronger sense of their ethnic identity. The Coeur d'Alene Tribe (CdAT), University of Idaho, and University of New Hampshire research alliance will recruit and work with middle school, high school, and undergraduate students from the CdAT Reservation in Idaho and other Tribal youth who attend University of Idaho, to develop high-quality audio documentaries focused on environmental decision-making processes. The production of a three- or five-minute high- quality audio documentary/podcast is a multilayered, labor-intensive process that emphasizes scientific inquiry, patience, and perseverance, ultimately requiring observation, data collection, analysis, and building a summary or conclusion.  While podcasts resonate strongly with the oral storytelling traditions of native American youth, they also provide a mechanism for conducting scientific inquiry. The project focuses on students learning about how to merge different knowledge systems (Western- mainstream/dominant science perspective, and Indigenous traditional knowledge) in order to become effective environmental decision-makers in the future. By investigating how community members resolve local environmental problems, students will be mentored by traditional and professional experts, and learn to utilize both STEM and cultural perspectives to solve environmental issues.  The project will develop and implement a unique, vertically integrated mentoring model where Native undergraduate students will be trained to mentor high school and middle school students, thereby helping middle school and high school students learn about pathways to college and other careers. <br/><br/>The V2H project will examine how people from Native American communities negotiate their Indigenous knowledge sources with Western science to make decisions in their everyday lives. The project grounds itself in research on how student's ethnic identity impacts their science learning and also decision-making capacity in their everyday life. Project research will employ a mixed-methods design. The project will address several research questions: (1) What complex systems thinking attributes do students demonstrate? (2) How do students merge or negotiate different knowledge systems (Indigenous and Western)? (3) How do the students ethnic identity change through both audio documentary making and mentoring? (4) What aspects of complex thinking and integrating knowledge systems improve students attitudes toward traditional and non-traditional STEM topics? Both quantitative and qualitative data will be collected and parallel data analysis will be implemented through the life of the project.  In order to understand what complex thinking attributes students demonstrate, the project will employ a pre- and post- modeling activity, using Mental Modeler, software that allows individuals to define components of a system and show the interconnectedness between the components of that system.

Catalyst selection involves a complicated juggling act to identify materials that selectively promote desired chemical reactions while avoiding undesired side reactions.  Typically, catalysts are selected through tedious trial-and-error screening of many combinations of materials. In contrast, this project seeks to accelerate the catalyst discovery process through mathematical and computer models that relate the properties of prospective catalytic materials to their ability to carry out the desired reactions under a wide range of conditions.  The improved catalyst designs resulting from the project will promote broader utilization of biomass as a carbon-neutral source of energy, directly addressing the nation's energy security while minimizing environmental impact. Training of graduate and undergraduate students in computational research will provide a future workforce for the emerging areas of computational and data-enabled science and engineering.<br/><br/>The project will focus on an integrated research and education program that provides molecular insights into the selective catalytic deoxygenation activity of transition metal catalysts (TMCs), particularly those based on bimetallic phosphide and carbide materials as the active components. From a technical standpoint, the primary objectives will be to understand the effects of solvent, temperature, and pressure on the binding modes of aromatic oxygenates while revealing mechanistic insights into C-O bond cleavage and competitive pathways for undesired products in the presence of solvents and high surface coverages of adsorbed species. The objectives will be accomplished by developing advanced first-principles Monte Carlo (FPMC) and molecular dynamics (FPMD) algorithms. These novel sampling algorithms will be used to investigate catalytic activity for the cleavage of carbon oxygen bonds including the beta-O-4 linkage by considering model compounds containing a phenolic hydroxyl group. In all these calculations, solvent molecules will be explicitly represented to determine their effect on reactants, transition states, products, and catalytic sites. Composition of model phosphide and carbide catalysts will be systematically varied to understand the structure-composition-property relationship for catalytic activity. More broadly, the FPMC and FPMD simulations will significantly advance the state-of-the-art in computational modeling, and provide advanced simulation tools to model catalytic processes under relevant thermodynamic constraints. The fundamental knowledge thus generated will provide a rational framework for designing efficient and effective catalysts for converting lignocellulosic biomass into fuels and chemicals. The algorithmic developments will be implemented in a widely distributed software suite, CP2K, enabling modeling of a wide range of heterogeneous catalytic processes, including zeolite-based catalysis and electrocatalysis. Beyond the graduate and undergraduate educational components, the project will provide K-12 educational outreach to economically disadvantaged communities.  In addition, professional development of middle school teachers, through workshops targeted at inquiry-based learning, will lead to higher retention of underrepresented groups in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers studying the transmission or spread of cultural practices in the ancient past rely largely on material and physical remains. Archaeology is especially well-suited to address these questions because it combines a critical engagement with material culture with a concern with change and interaction over time and space. In this context, writing presents an ideal case for exploring cultural transmission because of the material traces that it leaves and because its physical aspects are often ignored at the expense of its more abstract message. Mallory Matsumoto (Brown University) will undertake dissertation research to understand the production and transmission of writing. In addition to fostering interdisciplinary collaboration between archaeology, epigraphy, and anthropology, this work will demonstrate how interaction in one cultural context may affect another, an issue relevant to understanding both the past and the present. In addition to contributing to current understanding of pre-Columbian Maya civilization, the results will be especially relevant to contemporary Maya communities given their current efforts revive the hieroglyphic script as a symbol of identity and cultural heritage.<br/><br/>This dissertation research will examine if and how the networks through which writing is transmitted overlap with other contexts of cultural exchange. Its case study will be the ancient Maya hieroglyphic writing system, which was used for over 1500 years in areas of what are now Mexico, Guatemala, Belize, and Honduras. Critically, the writing system was shared among pre-Columbian Maya communities who were not only separated by space and time, but also were never politically unified. Although the decipherment of Maya hieroglyphs has advanced significantly in recent decades, scholars still do not understand how the writing system developed and spread. The investigator will analyze the form of Maya inscriptions and the hieroglyphs they contain to reconstruct which settlements were sharing which writing techniques, how these patterns changed over time, and how they related to interactions in other contexts like politics, warfare, or trade.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complex systems are made up of a large number of smaller components that interact in ways that can lead to interesting collective behaviors where the components act in concert.  Examples of such systems include materials, biological pathways, and neural networks as well as many engineered systems and social networks.  Complex systems are difficult to model.  Usually, mathematical models are most useful when they are sufficiently simple to capture the relevant parts of the phenomenon of interest while ignoring irrelevant details.  For complex systems, it is difficult to know from the start which components are relevant and which are irrelevant.  Consequently, models of real-world systems tend to be overly complicated, difficult to work with, and have limited predictive power compared to more parsimonious representations.<br/>This project leverages recent advances that combine the mathematical areas of information theory with differential geometry and topology.  The basic idea utilizes a systematic method for pruning irrelevant complications from a model of a complex system until a sufficiently simple model is obtained.  By enumerating all of the resulting approximations, the scientist has a roadmap from the complicated, detailed representation of the physical system, through various types of approximations and the system behaviors they describe.  Put another way, the process acts as a mathematical bridge across scales: connecting microscopic mechanisms to systems-level phenomena.  In this project, the PI will apply these new mathematical and associated computational tools to three target application areas: crystal structures of alloys, biochemical kinetics of developmental pathways, and networks of neurons.  By better understanding how mathematical models reflect relevant physical details, models will be better at predicting the behavior of complex systems and enable more sophisticated design and control of complicated materials and processes. <br/>This work also includes an educational component that will develop a pedagogy of interdisciplinary science.  This pedagogy will focus on university faculty in the form of a seminar series; university students in the form of a multi-department, special topics course; and high school teachers in the form of teaching workshops and web resources for high school science teachers.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY <br/>This CAREER award supports theoretical and computational research aimed at developing simple models of complex systems. Simple mathematical models have always played an important role in scientific inquiry.  For systems with separated scales or symmetries, there are standard techniques for constructing parsimonious representations from complicated, mechanistic descriptions.  Recent advances combining information theory and differential geometry and topology suggest new methods for reasoning about the relationship between mechanisms and phenomena in models of complex physical systems.  <br/>For this research, the PI takes the approach that the predictions of a multi-parameter model form a manifold embedded in an abstract data space.  It has been observed that typical model manifolds are bounded and that simple, approximate models reside on the boundary of the model manifold.  The Manifold Boundary Approximation Method constructs a sequence of limiting approximations, that is, ""small parameters"" that corresponds to a sequence of simple, approximate models.  This research will extend these results to three target application areas: alloy crystal structure, biochemical kinetics of developmental pathways, and networks of neurons.  Within these target application areas, the PI will develop a new approach to modeling based on the concept of a ""supremum model"", that is, the minimal model that simultaneously explains several behaviors.  When combined with the Manifold Boundary Approximation Method, the supremum model concept enables one to bootstrap from several models of overlapping system components to models of much larger systems, the direct exploration of which would be computationally challenging or infeasible.<br/>This work also includes an educational component that will develop a pedagogy of interdisciplinary science.  This pedagogy will target university faculty in the form of a seminar series; university students in the form of a multi-department, special topics course; and high school teachers in the form of teaching workshops and web resources for high school science teachers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Increases in algal blooms typically include cyanobacteria, which are capable of producing toxins called cyanotoxins. These cyanotoxins are harmful to human health and to other animals that live in or drink water from the lakes. There is little, historical data on algal blooms and cyanotoxins, which makes it difficult to understand how long they have been occurring and what makes them happen. This project will advance our understanding of algal blooms and cyanotoxin occurrence by focusing on the historical record of cyanotoxins that are preserved in the sediments of lakes. There are significant challenges in relating the cyanotoxin in lake sediments to their historic production in the water column of lakes. This EAGER project will develop innovative methods to extract and measure cyanotoxins in lake sediment, and conduct experiments to quantify how the toxins degrade under various environmental conditions. Researchers will then make critical determinations of historic production of these toxins for Lake Harris in Florida. Results from this project will be broadly useful in developing standard methods for the study of cyanotoxins in all lakes and reservoirs, and will provide lake and municipal water managers a new tool to acquire cyanotoxin data on a longer time scale. This project will also provide research training for graduate, undergraduate and high school students, including members of underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>While these paleolimnological investigations are providing much needed records of historic cyanotoxin production, it is unknown if changes in paleo-cyanotoxin stratigraphies result from alterations in toxin production, degradation or deposition. As a result, sediment studies incorporating cyanotoxins as a proxy are at risk to incorrectly infer historic toxin production. This research will establish cyanotoxin water-sediment connections, develop innovative analytical protocols, and cutting-edge degradation indices for determining cyanotoxin sediment studies on cylindrospermopsin and microcystin. In addition, results from these experiments will used to verify cyanotoxin deposition with known periods of historic eutrophication and limnological change throughout the Holocene. The objectives of the study are: 1) develop sediment-water column connections for cyanotoxins by matching surface sediment cyanotoxin concentrations with known water column cyanotoxin values and improving extraction methods, 2) determine degradation coefficients for CYN and MC in a variety of sediment types under a range of environmental variables (temperature, oxygen, organic matter content) experienced in lake sediment environments, and 3) identify stratigraphic changes of cyanotoxins and cyanobacteria pigments from sediment cores.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this project studies how Pay for Success (PFS), a public-private model for social programs, shapes state spending on specific populations in the United States. Under a PFS contract, private investors provide initial funding for a public program, which the government repays only if the program proves successful. The PFS model promises to meet citizen needs while minimizing costs, but it is not yet clear who benefits from these programs, who is left out, and how these decisions are made. This project aims to determine (1) whether the goals of PFS projects influence which populations ultimately benefit from these projects and (2) the consequences of the PFS model for the scope of social provision more broadly. Findings from this study will be useful to policymakers and public advocates as the implementation or modification of PFS programs is considered, and so will contribute to the general public well-being.<br/><br/>The analysis employs a comparative case study design to assess the effect of PFS structure on beneficiary populations across three social service domains. Data collection will be via interviews with public and private actors involved in the design and implementation of PFS programs. Two sets of comparisons will be made: (1) comparisons between PFS proposals that matriculate into social programs and PFS proposals that fail to launch; and (2) comparisons between PFS-structured social programs and traditional social programs within specific issue areas. The case comparisons will illustrate the relationship between the PFS models' cost-savings structure and the populations the model ultimately serves. They will also elucidate the ways in which the PFS model differs from traditional models of service provision in terms of cost and scope. In evaluating these outcomes, this project will contribute to research on public policy and public-private models of social service provision.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pristine lakes within those landscapes, especially lakes whose iconic beauty has led to their designation as World Heritage sites, have strong tourist appeal. Yet that beauty is threatened by changes to the clarity of the lake waters. Conservation efforts for these potentially fragile ecosystems would benefit from a predictive understanding of lake responses to global climate change. This research explores the consequences of these landscape-level changes for lake ecosystems.  Rather than study a single system over a long time, these researchers will substitute a comparison of lake ecosystems that currently differ in the extent of glacial and vegetation coverage in the catchment.  The primary aim of the research is to compare lake responses to rain and snowmelt-driven inputs of materials such as glacial flour, the finely ground rock from glaciers, and dissolved products of organic matter decomposition.  Both of these materials have strong effects on the clarity of the water or water transparency, which in turn influences many aspects of lake ecosystem function.  Lake responses will be examined using two complementary measurements of ecological resilience: resistance, the magnitude of change in the system following rain or snowmelt events; and recovery, the rate of return to previous conditions.  Project findings will deepen the basic scientific understanding of the effects of changing landscapes on lake ecosystems in the Rocky Mountains.  Undergraduate students will be engaged in all stages of the research, including planning, data collection, analysis, and publication.  Targeted efforts will be made to attract students from diverse backgrounds and experiences.  Because water transparency of mountain lakes is a powerful case study through which to communicate ecosystem-level effects of environmental change to a broader audience, a short film describing the research will be produced and  distributed.<br/><br/>The proposed research will test the overarching hypothesis that changes in the resilience of water transparency occur systematically as lake catchments shift from glaciated to rocky to vegetated states.  Specifically, resistance of water transparency is predicted to increase with glacial loss and decrease with vegetation advance.  Additionally, recovery rates of water transparency are predicted to increase as the regulator of transparency shifts from suspended rock flour in glacial catchment lakes to dissolved organic matter (DOM) in vegetated catchment lakes.  To test these hypotheses, high frequency monitoring buoys equipped with sensors that measure turbidity and the fluorescent component of DOM will be deployed in five lakes that vary across a gradient of glacial and vegetation coverage.  Concurrent hydrological data will be used to better understand dynamics of material inputs and their relationships to meteorological data recorded at nearby weather stations.  More generally, the research probes the relationship between the two components of resilience by testing whether resistance and recovery change independently as glaciers retreat and vegetation advances.  The potential for uncoupled changes in the two components of resilience is a unique and transformative aspect of the research program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Numerical models used in predicting environmental conditions in estuaries often have difficulties in reproducing stratification affecting our ability to accurately predict various biogeochemical processes, including bottom water hypoxia. This may be related to the lack of proper parameterizations for wave-induced mixing in the pycnocline. Nonlinear internal waves are ubiquitous in the stratified coastal ocean and play an important role in generating turbulent mixing and transporting biochemically important materials. However, nonlinear internal waves have been rarely studied in stratified estuaries, except for flows over sills at the entrance to deep fjords. Turbulence and mixing in estuaries has been mainly attributed to bottom boundary layer turbulence whereas little attention has been paid to breaking internal waves. This project will re-analyze experimental data and use numerical models to examine the role of internal waves in estuarine mixing. It will provide educational opportunities for one Ph.D. graduate student who will be trained in numerical ocean modeling, and advanced data analysis techniques. In addition, undergraduate students will be involved in this project during the summer months.<br/><br/>Tidal currents in coastal plain estuaries primarily move in the along isobath direction and are thought to be no-conducive to internal wave generation. On the other hand, most coastal plain estuaries feature a deep channel flanked by shallow shoals, with steep bathymetric changes in the cross-channel direction. Moreover, lateral circulation has been observed in many estuaries. It is hypothesized that when the internal Froude number exceeds 1, the interaction between the lateral circulation and channel-shoal bathymetry leads to the generation of an internal lee wave. The latter evolves into a train of nonlinear internal waves through nonlinear steepening and dispersion. It is also hypothesized that under strong tidal or wind forcing conditions the lateral circulation generates frontogenesis and a bottom gravity current which excites upstream propagating nonlinear internal waves. These hypotheses are based on the recent observations of internal lee waves and internal solitary waves in Chesapeake Bay and will be tested using process-oriented and realistic modeling. The previously collected mooring data will be re-analyzed to better quantify the relationship between nonlinear internal waves and estuarine turbulent mixing.  A realistic 3-D hydrostatic model of Chesapeake Bay will be run to conduct hindcast simulations and interpret the observational data. The generation, propagation and transformation of internal waves in estuaries will be investigated using hydrostatic and non-hydrostatic models configured over an idealized estuarine channel. The wave generation mechanisms will be explored under a wide range of river flow, tidal and wind forcing conditions. These model runs will be complemented by data analysis to identify the connection between nonlinear internal waves and mixing in the estuary.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Part of the impetus for such discovery research is that iron deficiency<br/>is one of the most significant micronutrient malnutrition problems facing the world<br/>today. The World Health Organization estimates that ~1.62 billion people--~25% of the<br/>world's population-- are affected by iron deficiency. The production of staple crops that<br/>have elevated iron in edible parts (e.g., in the grains of cereals) is widely regarded as the<br/>primary means by which this problem could be stably addressed. However, this goal is<br/>thwarted because our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms controlling iron<br/>accumulation in plants is far from complete. The scientists conducting this project have<br/>discovered that three distinct iron transporter proteins are required in the leaves of<br/>plants in order for those leaves to send correct signals of iron deficiency to the roots.<br/>Since the roots take up iron in response to signals from the leaves, investigation of the<br/>leaf transporters will reveal new mechanisms that plants use to control iron uptake. In<br/>addition to these scientific goals, the researchers will work to enhance educational<br/>opportunities for undergraduates and K-12 students through the development of multimedia<br/>web modules for K-12 outreach, and the development of course based<br/>undergraduate research experiences (CURES).<br/><br/>Prior work on the regulation and localization of Arabidopsis iron transporters, OPT3,<br/>YSL1 and YSL3 has indicated that they have opposite but indispensable roles in<br/>controlling shoot-to-root signaling of iron status. A working hypothesis that explains<br/>current observations is that OPT3 and YSL1/YSL3 together modulate phloem companion<br/>cell Fe status, and that low concentrations of Fe in the companion cells results in the<br/>production of a phloem mobile signal that initiates iron deficiency regulated gene<br/>expression in roots. In this project, a combination of transporter activity studies, protein<br/>localization, and highly accurate determination of the metal distribution in veins will test<br/>this hypothesis. The project scientists have established the presence of a phloem-mobile<br/>inductive RNA signal that is capable of inducing iron deficiency associated gene<br/>expression in excised roots. Because a simple assay system for the phloem mobile<br/>signal has been developed, profiling experiments coupled with downstream genetic<br/>analyses will be used to identify the phloem mobile signal produced in iron deficient<br/>leaves that regulates root gene expression.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will build upon ideas that have proven successful in statistical physics and the relatively new field of information theory.  The expected output is a quantitative, predictive and thus testable, theory of ecosystem structure that will be applicable to both undisturbed ecosystems and to those that are changing rapidly in response to disturbance.

These state variables will then provide the constraints used in maximizing information entropy to yield predicted probability distributions for the detailed patterns displayed by individuals and species. The expected outcome is a general theory of both static and dynamic ecology.  Ecological census data from the tropics to the tundra, from plants to animals, across a wide range of spatial scales, and under a variety of disturbances, will be used to test the predictions of the new theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It appears that many long-lived groups are becoming threatened, even ones that have survived for millions of years. This is in contrast to the findings of previous studies of the fossil record, which have shown that older groups were generally less likely to go extinct. The only exception to this pattern is during periods of mass extinction. This project will compare modern and ancient extinctions to better understand extinction risk and threats to current biodiversity. The project also will provide research experience for undergraduate students and contribute to an outreach program for underserved middle school students.<br/><br/>Previous studies have compared the magnitude or rate of modern biodiversity loss with those of ancient mass extinctions. To improve our understanding of modern extinctions, this project will compare extinction selectivity with respect to genus age in modern and fossil classes. Extinction risk will be assessed at the generic level using the IUCN Red List for modern classes, and using the Paleobiology Database for fossil classes. Ages of both modern and fossil genera will be determined from the Paleobiology Database. The relationship between extinction risk and genus age will be quantified and provide a basis for comparing modern extinctions with those in the fossil record.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These fungi garner nutrients from the soil and exchange them for carbohydrates obtained by plants during photosynthesis. The vast majority of these plants also rely on animals for pollination. Plant interactions with these mutualists may be intertwined in important ways, but have most often been studied separately. This research will examine how mycorrhizal fungi affect plant traits important to pollination, and how the environmental context affects these interactions. These questions will be examined in an agricultural species of great economic importance in the United States - the highbush blueberry (Vaccinium corymbosum).  Additionally, through existing farm-to-plate programs, relationships with K-12 teachers, and new collaborations with an agricultural outreach program, school children will be engaged in activities to learn about the importance of healthy below- and above-ground organisms, and high school and college students will be engaged in scientific research.<br/><br/>The project will examine if mycorrhizae affect floral traits important to pollinators in host genotype-specific ways.  Additionally, the identity and relative abundance of mycorrhizae will be examined for effects on floral trait expression in the host.  Mycorrhizal-driven differences in floral traits will be explored for their effects on pollinator visitation and resulting pollen limitation.  The links among mycorrhizae, floral traits, and pollination are hypothesized to depend on pollinator abundance, diversity, and identity. The work will capitalize on state-of-the-art molecular tools to understand if plant response to mycorrhizal fungi is dependent on the identity of fungal communities, and entail extensive field experiments to understand the importance of the native pollinator communities as well. To examine these hypotheses, highbush blueberry of two different cultivars (genotypes) will be inoculated with a commercially available inoculum or with soils containing native fungal spores and grown in pots in a common garden.  Once they flower, plants will be placed at six farms in Vermont alongside existing blueberry bushes.  Floral traits will be measured on each plant.  In addition, a pollen limitation experiment will be conducted to examine if mycorrhizal inoculation affects pollen limitation. Experimental plants, as well as others growing at each site, will be observed and the number and identity of bee pollinators will be recorded to assess site-specific differences in pollinator communities.  The data will be gathered over three years, analyzed and widely distributed to scientists and to farmers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Archaeological investigation allows scholars to generate relevant insights about processes of social inequality and political centralization over extended periods of time in human history, which include the emergence of sedentary communities, the development of larger polities, and their disintegrations. Previous scholarship has found that migration can be important during the process of political centralization, where on some occasions non-local individuals are drawn to big centers as the power and influence of those cities increased. Scholars are interested in examining the role that these migrations had during the development of social inequalities and political growth. Diet can play an important role for studying political centralization and social inequality because it not only provides us information about health, but also social class, ethnic groups, and lifestyle affiliations. By studying ancient populations, places of origin and cultural landscapes, the researchers can begin identifying and differentiating ethnic groups, social class, lifestyles, dietary practices, and other social complexities of human culture. The results of the proposed research will contribute to the study of migration, diet, social inequalities, political centralization, as well as to that of the emergence and decline of centralized polities not only in Mesoamerica but also in other parts of the world. <br/><br/>Mr. Palomo will examine social inequality and political centralization processes at critical moments of the human history, which include the emergence of sedentary communities, the development of larger polities, and their disintegrations. To address these issues, the scholars are examining two more specific questions: 1) How were social inequality and political centralization reflected in dietary practices? 2) How were changes in social inequality and political centralization associated with those in-migrations and external relations? To examine these questions, the research team will conduct a multi-isotopic analysis on the skeletal remains of 86 sampled individuals from the Mayan archaeological site of Ceibal that date from the Middle Preclassic to the Terminal Classic periods. During the analysis, the researchers will create and promote education and training opportunities for students. Carbon and nitrogen isotopic data will allow the scholars to examine whether changes in social inequality and political centralization were accompanied by those in the diet. Oxygen, strontium, and lead isotopic analysis will be used to examine whether Ceibal attracted more migrants and whether there were more hostile external relations during the periods of growing political centralization or during the establishment of political regimes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gaining an understanding how small molecule affect this protein can help scientists understand and control cell death. Undergraduate students will gain research experience in organic synthesis and biochemistry. <br/><br/>The cell has many adaptive mechanisms used for the cellular repair during endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress. If proteostasis is not re-established, unfolded proteins are tagged for clearance through the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). Aberrant cells have been shown to exploit these prosurvival mechanisms as a way to circumvent cell death. However proteasome disruption leads to cell death. Valosin-containing protein (VCP) is a key component of the UPS which may be targeted to investigate its role in proteostasis. Small molecule heterocycles such as imidazoles have the potential to allosterically bind to VCP to disrupt the UPS in rogue cells. The utilization of a two-step synthesis of a library of novel imidazole compounds through microwave-assisted multicomponent reactions will allow a variety of imidazole compounds to be rapidly synthesized.

This proposed research will study how different mass media programs to improve health interact with each other to affect other outcomes that were not targeted.  It will develop a theory and test it with an experiment in which individuals are randomly reminded or incentivized to engage in one healthy behavior, two healthy behaviors, or nothing at all. By comparing outcomes across these groups, the study will discover whether these mechanisms cause interference between programs, and if so, which mechanisms are most important. This is the first study that uses theory and experiments to study the general mechanisms that may produce interactions among interventions. The results of this study promise to directly help the beneficiaries of programs that promote healthy (or otherwise beneficial) behaviors in underserved communities by enabling policy makers to coordinate programs more effectively.  The results of this research will improve the performance of many government and business programs, thus improving the lives of many US citizens.<br/><br/>This research will study whether there are mechanisms that cause behavior change campaigns to have spillovers or interactions, identify those mechanisms, and understand their implications in dynamic settings in different domains.  Evidence of spillovers or interactions implies that campaigns can be made more effective through coordination.   The research will take inventory of theories in economics and psychology that predict spillovers or interactions, organize them into a simple framework, and test the predictions of the framework with a field experiment.  SMS reminder programs about one ``target'' behavior or two such programs will be sent to participants and compare responses to the effects on non-target behaviors to establish if interactions exist, and distinguish between several possible mechanisms. Two additional studies will: (i) explore how these mechanisms operate in a dynamic setting, and (ii) investigate when to expect spillovers or interactions.

Urban populations now account for over half of the world's population, with the proportion projected to grow to two-thirds by the mid-21st century.  Of this increase, 90% is expected to take place in developing countries, including those with authoritarian governments.  This research project investigates how urban labor migration, a key driver of this projected urbanization, can be catalyzed by development projects that may seem to have little to do with migration, such as those that subsidize rural house construction.  It analyzes how these development projects shape ideas about modernity and how these in turn encourage migration.  It also investigates how urban migration shapes senses of self and identity, and how these work with or against states' attempts to govern their populations. The project's findings will be widely disseminated via academic and non-academic outlets.  Results are relevant to policy-makers, NGOs, and development organizations concerned with the social impacts of rapid urbanization throughout the developing world.  <br/><br/>Using qualitative (participant observation, semi-structured interviews, surveys, and textual and discourse analysis) field-gathered data, this project examines the relationship between development as a rationale of rule and its actual accomplishment, and how state power (re)shapes desires vis-a-vis housing as a form of development.  The project contributes to the field of development geography through its investigation of governmentality and modernity in an authoritarian, non-Western context.  It also contributes to the geography of migration by analyzing how cultural politics and political-economic factors come together in producing labor migration, and how the experience of labor migration shapes migrant and urban subjectivities. This study investigates these broad questions by asking how and why villagers make the decisions they do with respect to accepting and spending on housing projects; how and why they make decisions about labor migration; and how urban living experiences change their aspirations and identities.  Although this project uses a case study of Tibetans in Qinghai province, China, its approach and findings has applicability in many other places experiencing rapid urbanization.

However, social networks must change across time; for example, all social networks eventually lose individuals through death or dispersal, and new individuals join social networks through birth and immigration. Thus, the simple and universal processes of birth, death and movement fundamentally shape the structure of social networks at any given time. A major goal of this project is to understand how demography and social behavior interact to affect the development and stability of social networks across time. The project will integrate theoretical models with long-term field research focusing on the social network of flock associations in a wintering migrant bird species, the golden-crowned sparrow. Seasonal social networks in migratory birds allows for the repeated study of the process of network formation with a mix of old and new individuals present in the population each year. As a whole, this project will pose new questions that can shed light on the processes that govern how societies take shape, and the resilience of social structure in the face of constant change, in animal populations and even in human societies. The project will integrate research goals with two different types of educational activities: development of teaching curricula on reproducible research and the recruitment of students of immigrant/refugee background to higher education and science. <br/><br/>This project proposes a general framework for understanding the temporal dynamics of social networks under population turnover. The model breaks the process into three steps: node loss, node attachment and social integration. Node loss and node attachment dynamics describe the effects of demography, while social integration captures the processes underlying the formation of new flock associations. This model will enable the study of the joint effects of demography, social processes, and fitness consequences of social position on social network structure. The field-based empirical work will explore natural long-term dynamics in social networks spanning multiple generations of a single avian species. Field experiments will be conducted to test the effects of social position on behaviors such as finding novel food sources, as well as, the effects of social relations on dominance interactions.  The educational objectives of this project will make significant contributions towards improving education and enhancing diversity in STEM. This project will enhance the capacity for reproducible research among hundreds of undergraduate and graduate students through development of new curricula. The project will also work to increase recruitment of a significantly overlooked, under-served community, i.e., refugee and immigrant populations in the Midwest.

The project will provide new insights regarding ways to integrate information about spectral-temporal variability from remotely sensed images with field inventories of tree species and stress symptom levels.  By furthering the potential to reduce labor-intensive fieldwork and instead use new, high-resolution remote sensing imagery to assess tree species and stress symptom levels, this project can help advance research on the interplay of different factors on the health of urban forests.  The project will help advance the practice of urban forest management, which has significant societal value because healthy urban forests improve urban air quality, enhance ground water maintenance, and moderate urban air temperatures.  Although this project will focus on a case study in Washington, D.C., the development of an accurate, robust, and repeatable methodology for using widely available, state-of-the-art remote sensing data to update forest inventories of tree species and tree stress will have utility in a much broader set of urban and rural settings.

The doctoral student conducting this project will develop a robust and accurate method to identify tree species and stress symptom level to improve urban sustainability using optimized suite of remote sensing data and machine-learning algorithms.  She will seek answers to two questions related to phenological variations in the foliage of different kinds of trees at different times of the year:  (1) With the leaf pigment-induced changes in the visible-light spectral bands, will spring leaf emergence and fall senescence phenology periods be most informative to predict tree species?  (2) Will the magnitude of decline in near infrared reflectance spectral bands during late summer be the most predictive component to predict changes in stress symptom level within a certain tree species?

This award will support just the 8 students from U.S.-based educational institutions in addition to the panelists.  The event will take place on April 21-22 in conjunction with the ACM 2018 Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI 2018) sponsored by the Association for Computing Machinery's Special Interest Group on Human-Computer Interaction (SIGCHI), which will be held April 21-26 in Montreal, Canada.  The annual CHI conferences are the leading international forum for the presentation and discussion of human-computer interaction (HCI) research and practice, and they are attended by approximately 3,000 HCI professionals from around the world.  Research reports published in the CHI Conference Proceedings and the CHI Extended Abstracts are heavily-refereed and widely cited; they are among the most scientifically respected and impactful research publications in the field of HCI.  More information about this year's conference, whose theme is ""Engage with CHI"", is available online at https://chi2018.acm.org/.  The annual CHI doctoral consortia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of HCI researchers, allowing them to create a social network both among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Applications are encouraged from all doctoral students whose research is HCI-related, regardless of the fields in which they are earning their degrees.  To increase the broad impact of the event, the organizers are committed to diversity.  Due to timing issues, the student participants for 2018 have already been selected; there are a total of 20 students (9 females and 11 males) from 10 different countries around the world, who represent a wide range of topic areas and backgrounds; in addition, no more than one student was accepted from any given institution.<br/><br/>The Doctoral Consortium is a research-focused meeting that has taken place annually at the CHI conference since 1986, and has helped to launch the careers of many outstanding HCI researchers.  The 2018 Consortium will be a 2-day long event on April 21-22.  Goals of the workshop include building a cohort group of new researchers who will have a network of colleagues spread out across the world, guiding the work of new researchers by having experts in the field give them advice, and making it possible for promising new entrants to the field to attend their research conference.  This year's DC will adopt the successful schedule implemented in 2017, where the group breaks into clusters of 3-4 students paired with one faculty panelist.  Each student participant will have a time slot of approximately 20 minutes in which to make a formal presentation about his or her doctoral research and to receive feedback both from the faculty panelist and the other student participants.  The feedback will be constructive and geared to help the students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other HCI research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  Follow up activities, including two poster sessions, are planned during the technical program of the conference on April 23-26.  Extended abstracts of the students' work will be published in the CHI 2018 Extended Abstracts.  SIGCHI's conference management committee will evaluate the doctoral research consortium, and the results will be made available to the organizers of future consortia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a community-led program aiming at providing mentoring to junior women in physical oceanography to improve their retention in the field. The activities carried out as part of the program contribute to the creation of a scientific workforce whose diversity more closely matches that of the student and of the U.S. population. This is achieved by aiding the retention of women in the field of physical oceanography and other geoscience disciplines. The program was initiated in 2004, it was first fully funded by federal agencies in the spring of 2007, and then renewed in 2009. The objectives of the program, as determined by the community in a planning workshop in the fall of 2005, are to: (1) provide continuity of mentoring from a young woman?s graduate career, through her postdoctoral years to the first years of her permanent job, (2) establish a collective responsibility within the physical oceanography community for the mentoring of junior women in the field, (3) provide a variety of mentoring resources and mentors, (4) cast a wide net to avoid exclusiveness, and (5) open this mentoring program to all those who self-identify as a physical oceanographer. Specifically, the following MPOWIR activities will be carried out:<br/>1.Pattullo conference: A biannual conference that brings together about 25 junior women physical oceanographers, and 12 senior physical oceanographers, both male and female, for a 2.5-day meeting focused on discipline-based mentoring.<br/>2.Mentoring groups: Groups of approximately 6 junior women and 2 senior women physical oceanographers meet monthly through a teleconference, for confidential, personalized mentoring.<br/>3.MPOWIR website: The website serves as a repository of resources for mentoring and physical oceanography careers.<br/>4.Databases and surveys: Regular surveys are conducted to assess the effectiveness of MPOWIR activities, determine community mentoring needs, and evaluate progress in retention.<br/>5.Town hall meetings and networking: Events at the Ocean Sciences meeting facilitate networking between physical oceanographers and provide career development information to junior scientists.<br/><br/>The website and town hall meetings are open to all, and great emphasis is placed on making material available via the website, to ensure a gender-neutral benefit. Efforts to export the MPOWIR model to other disciplines and institutions will be undertaken via links with the Earth Science Women's Network, and through a quarterly newsletter. Social media will be used to publicize MPOWIR activities, announcement and events. This work, through its focus on the retention of women in the field of physical oceanography, will allow further capitalization on the investment the funding agencies and universities have made on the education of women students. Essentially, the planned activities seek to stem the loss of intellectual capital for the physical oceanographic field, as well as other geoscience disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the large range of characteristic time and length scales observed in biological processes makes the use of any single computational technique difficult.  While atomic-resolution simulations can furnish a scientist with exquisite levels of detail, the sheer computational expense of these simulations sometimes presents a significant barrier for their application to large-scale biological problems.  This project proposes to us coarse-grained (CG) molecular models to expand the reach of computer simulations to cellular scales. The project propose to integrate atomic-resolution and CG simulations to study a range of biologically relevant systems, in close collaboration with an international cohort of scientists from various experimental fields. This work will involve not only elucidating and explaining biomolecular processes, but also the development and dissemination of cutting-edge simulation software to the wider scientific community.<br/><br/>The project aims to combine experimental data with cutting-edge computer simulations to investigate a number of important biomolecular systems.   The systems of interest can be grouped into two main categories: critical stages of the viral lifecycles of HIV-1 and influenza, and studies of the actin filaments and microtubules of the cellular cytoskeleton.   The project will develop an integrated pipeline which allows scientists to convert experimental data into computer models capable of investigating biomolecular processes at scales that are inaccessible to other approaches. While the results of atomic-scale simulations will clearly be important in and of themselves, they will also, in combination with experimental data, form the basis for generating and parameterizing rigorous UCG models. Results and predictions made by these models will be validated by close collaboration with experimental scientists, and used to suggest new directions in both the theoretical and experimental field.  In addition to the development and deployment of advanced biomolecular simulation techniques, this proposal will also assist in the dissemination of the advances to the wider research community by the integration of the UCG model generation and simulation algorithms with the popular LAMMPS software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

No other group of animals has such diverse forelimbs, and the flexibility of mammal forelimbs seems to be a key reason for the group's success. The first mammal relatives found in the fossil record are over 300 million years old, and are a striking contrast to living mammals: their forelimbs show a very limited range of shapes and functions. How did the evolutionarily-flexible forelimbs of mammals evolve from such seemingly constrained ancestors, and did changes to the forelimb increase the ability of mammals to explore new ways of life? This research project will use state-of-the-art techniques, and extensive data from fossils and modern animals, to reconstruct forelimb structure and function in ancient mammal relatives, and to test whether changes to the forelimb correlate with increases in their ecological diversity. The results will deepen our understanding of the evolution of a quintessential characteristic of mammals, and its role in the evolution of animals as distinct as bats, moles, whales, horses, and humans. Dissemination of the research will occur through a series of educational online videos produced by the award-winning YouTube Channel ""The Brain Scoop"". The series will include three episodes describing different stages of the research, and two episodes that describe the results and their significance. Audience responses to the videos will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of online videos as a tool for science education.<br/><br/>Modern mammals display remarkable ecomorphological diversity, which is underpinned by exaptation of the forelimb to serve novel functions (e.g. flying, running, swimming, and digging). In contrast, the ancestors of mammals - the non-mammalian synapsids - are generalized terrestrial tetrapods with seemingly limited ecological scope. The mammalian-style forelimb, including a fully mobile scapula, ventrally oriented ball-and-socket shoulder joint, and ""upright"" limb posture and movement, is the result of a profound reorganization of the ancestral synapsid musculoskeletal system. Drawing from the extensive synapsid fossil record, this project integrates a diverse set of methodological techniques to pinpoint how morphofunctional transformation of the forelimb influenced the tempo and mode of phenotypic evolution of the synapsid clade. Rigorous morphometric analyses will quantify shape disparity in forelimb skeletal elements and identify major shifts in morphology. Cutting-edge biomechanical analyses will correlate morphological shifts with functional transformation. And, advanced phylogenetic modeling techniques will determine whether shifts in morphology and function resulted in increases in diversification rates. Key products include a new comprehensive metatree of Synapsida, an extensive geometric morphometric dataset, and 3D musculoskeletal models of ten taxa at phylogenetically informative stages of synapsid evolution. Combined, this project will build a robust comparative framework to quantify musculoskeletal transformations in extinct animals and provide a unique evolutionary perspective on an integrated anatomical module of significant adaptive value.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Distinguishing cutting edge research and development activities can inform strategy development and reveal new opportunities. Being able to measure emergent topics additionally enables sharper research program assessment. Indicators of which countries, organizations, or individuals are contributing most to advances in a given domain provide vital competitive technical intelligence. The project's new technological emergence indicators focus on frontier contributions to complement general science, technology, and innovation indicators. We formulate a suite of indicators, develop software routines to calculate them, and devise reports and visualizations to communicate to different audiences, including researchers, managers, and policy makers.<br/><br/>The project implements a four-attribute model of what constitutes technological emergence. Emergent topics should evidence term novelty, persistence, and accelerating growth, plus show formation of a research community. The approach extracts records on given science and technology topics from global research publication and patent databases. The research experiments with different ways to clean and consolidate those records' topical content. Then the project devises software scripts to score topics' degree of emergence. The computational algorithm then scores actors in given research areas, such as research organizations or countries, based on the extent to which the actors work on the  highly emerging topics. The makeup of the scores and how they behave is then studied through nine diversified science and technology case studies. Testing includes a series of sensitivity analyses across fields and time periods. The testing seeks to validate the emergence indicators by analyzing their performance in predicting research and development activity in a subsequent one-to-three-year period. These new technological emergence indicators will be examined in conjunction with established science and technology metrics to help assess research and development capabilities and opportunities. The project will explore ways to apply the emergence indicators, such as gauging how government funding programs advance cutting edge research topic activity, or tracking diffusion of topical content from research to patents to commercialization arenas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because microalgae are the basis of marine food webs, scientists strive to improve our understanding of Fe availability in the oceans and the importance of different iron sources. Iron enters the ocean via rivers, groundwater, and wind-blown dust; however, release from the seafloor can be an additional source but this contribution is not well known. In this project, scientists from the State University of New York, Stony Brook (SUNY-SB) will investigate how chemical reactions in ocean sediments and bottom-dwelling organisms, such as burrowing clams and worms, affect the transport of Fe from the seafloor into the overlying water. Animals pump water through their burrows to obtain oxygen and in the process, transport dissolved Fe out of the sediment and into the overlying water. We will analyze the Fe concentration in both muddy and sandy sediment and in the water that enters and exits animal burrows, as well as determine the isotope composition of the Fe. Different sources of Fe can have different isotope compositions which may help trace the origin of this element found in different parts of the ocean. An improved understanding of Fe cycling at the ocean seafloor will help us to better predict how changing environmental conditions, for example due to human influence, will affect important processes in the ocean, such as primary production by microalgae. <br/><br/>The project will allow two PhD students and several undergraduate students to take part in laboratory experimental work, sediment sampling during research cruises and train in chemical analysis of sediment and water.

It combines field sampling, laboratory experimentation, data analyses, and scientific communication. Students will set-up their own ""seafloor ant farms"" and record the activities of animals living in the sediment using photographic equipment. Students will be trained in using image analysis software to produce time-lapse movies which they will present on the final day of the program. Public outreach will be fostered through annual hands-on demonstrations of ""seafloor slices"" at the New York Marine Science Festival ""Submerge"" and at SUNY-SB earth celebration day ""Earthstock"" with real-time visualizations of pressure dynamics in the sediment induced by living organisms or by injecting water with syringes. The project supports the advancement and development of two Early Career Scientists with no prior NSF research support.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Dissolved Fe is an important nutrient for photosynthetic microalgae in the surface ocean and can limit their productivity. Iron is supplied to the ocean from multiple sources, including rivers, groundwater, hydrothermal vents, and by release from the seabed.  This project will fill key gaps in our knowledge of seabed sources, and emphasizes the interconnected effects of bioturbation by infaunal organisms, bottom water oxygen (O2) concentrations, sedimentary organic matter content, and sediment permeability on iron cycling and isotopic redistribution in continental margin sediments. Specifically, we will gain a mechanistic understanding of the impact of variable O2 concentrations within infaunal burrows (as a function of irrigation activity and sedimentary setting) and in the overlying water (in response to large scale environmental change) on dissolved Fe fluxes and re-precipitation, the isotopic fractionation related to these processes, and the consequences for isotopic signatures of dissolved Fe in the water column and particulate Fe preserved in sediments. This project will significantly advance understanding of sedimentary Fe cycling and the use of Fe isotopes to constrain the magnitude and dynamics of the benthic Fe source to the ocean.  Improved understanding of sedimentary Fe cycle will enhance prediction of future responses of biogeochemical processes such as primary production to rapidly changing environmental conditions and to optimally infer past conditions from authigenic Fe minerals preserved in the sedimentary record. This knowledge is particularly valuable with regard to continental shelf environments where anthropogenic effects are altering deposition patterns of organic carbon and expanding oxygen minimum zones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are often thousands of meters below the surface of the ocean along the large volcanic mountain ranges called the mid-ocean ridges. Relatively little is known about these hydrothermal vents because they exist so far from the ocean surface. Instead of lava, these vents emit warm to hot fluids (from several ºC up to 350 ºC) into the ocean, and contain high concentrations of a wide range of dissolved chemicals. One of these chemicals, iron, has been studied extensively by ocean scientists because of its importance as an essential nutrient for the microscopic photosynthetic algae called phytoplankton that grow in surface ocean waters. Scientists once thought that most of the dissolved iron coming out of hydrothermal vent fluids would quickly precipitate (form a solid and sink) near the vents, as a result of chemical reactions between the hot vent fluid and cold seawater, and therefore only small amounts of dissolved iron could be transported from the deep sea mid-ocean ridges to surface waters where phytoplankton grow. However, on a recent scientific expedition over one of the most active mid-ocean ridges called the southern East Pacific Rise (SEPR), scientists discovered that much of the dissolved iron discharged from the SEPR hydrothermal vents was in fact transported thousands of kilometers across the deep ocean. In addition, computer simulations suggest that a substantial amount of this hydrothermal iron is transported as far as the surface waters of the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, where it could support the growth of phytoplankton.<br/><br/>Scientists from the University of Washington, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Old Dominion University will return to the SEPR aboard a research ship and make additional measurements to better understand how hydrothermal vents add dissolved iron to the deep ocean. They will use specialized sampling equipment, including unmanned miniature submarines called autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), to map the distribution of hydrothermal vents in this region, and collect water samples from both high temperature (250-350 ºC) and low temperature (< 150 ºC) vents.  These samples will be analyzed for chemicals that are enriched in the hydrothermal vent fluids, such as iron, manganese and helium-3, which will provide information on the chemical changes that occur as the hydrothermal vent fluids mix with surrounding seawater and are carried away from the SEPR.  The scientists will use their observations and chemical analyses to address the following major questions: 1) are there more hydrothermal vents along mid ocean ridges than previously thought? and (2) are low temperature hydrothermal vents especially favorable for stabilizing dissolved iron, and ultimately transporting it to the surface ocean where it supports phytoplankton growth? <br/><br/>The project will contribute to the education and training of a graduate student and two senior undergraduate students, and outcomes will be incorporated into high school STEM curricula.  The research activities will be communicated via public lectures and media releases, and project results will be disseminated to the scientific community by conference presentations, publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and freely available on-line archived data.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Along thousands of kilometers of the seafloor volcanic chains known as the mid-ocean ridges, hydrothermal vents discharge hot, acidic, metal-rich fluids into the deep ocean. These submarine hot springs are a major gateway for the exchange of heat and chemicals between the solid earth and the deep ocean, and have received intensive scientific study during the last 40 years.  This research has overwhelmingly focused on high temperature (~200-350°C) hydrothermal vents.  Lower temperature (<150°C) hydrothermal venting has received relatively little attention, although results from recent observational and modeling studies point to the greater abundance of low temperature discharge along the mid-ocean ridges, and its potential importance for the input of elements and chemical compounds into the deep ocean.  Among the elements that are enriched in hydrothermal vent fluids, iron has received attention because of its role as an essential nutrient for primary production in the surface ocean.  It has long been thought that most of the dissolved iron discharged by hydrothermal vents is lost from solution close to mid-ocean ridge sources, and thus of limited importance for ocean chemistry.  But this view has been challenged by recent studies which suggest that chemical stabilization of hydrothermal dissolved iron may facilitate its long-range transport in the deep ocean. In particular, results from the US GEOTRACES program have revealed the lateral transport of a plume of hydrothermal dissolved iron over several thousand kilometers westward from its source region on the southern East Pacific Rise (SEPR).<br/><br/>In this project, investigators from the University of Washington, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Old Dominion University will carry out a field research program on the SEPR to test the overarching hypothesis that diffuse low-temperature hydrothermal venting is a major a source of chemically-stabilized dissolved iron to the deep ocean, and hence plays an important but previously overlooked role in the ocean iron cycle.  The ship-based field program will use an autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with in-situ optical and chemical sensors to identify plumes of both diffuse (low-temperature) and discrete (high-temperature) hydrothermal discharge along the SEPR.  Emissions from multiple sites of both low and high temperature hydrothermal venting will be sampled for shipboard and post-cruise analyses of iron and other trace metals, and the inert hydrothermal ""tracer"" helium-3.  The resulting data will be used to test two specific hypotheses: (1) the population of active hydrothermal discharge sites along mid ocean ridges is greater than previously estimated, (2) low temperature hydrothermal venting is conducive to the chemical stabilization of dissolved iron, thus facilitating its export to the ocean interior and ultimately to surface ocean where it supports primary production by phytoplankton.  The information obtained in this research will facilitate inclusion of iron and other trace elements in numerical models of ocean biology and biogeochemistry, which will improve the ability to predict how the ocean will respond to and modulate future climatic and environmental changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As many of these chips may be manufactured in environments of limited trust, problems of the piracy of intellectual property (IP) and the overproduction of integrated circuits (ICs) have emerged in recent years. This project focuses on designing a secure logic locking technique to enable protection against untrusted IC manufacturing. The developed solution is resistant to all known attacks.<br/> <br/>Logic locking is a promising solution for enabling trust in outsourced IC manufacturing, where a design is obfuscated by modifying the functionality. A locked chip will produce incorrect results unless activated by an obfuscation key. However, Boolean satisfiability (SAT)-based algorithms have been shown to effectively determine the obfuscation key and break the locking mechanisms. In this work, a novel secure cell (SC) is designed, which prevents the obfuscation key from being captured in internal flip-flops of a chip and disables scan dump after functional mode. The SC provides a complete protection against SAT-based and other existing attacks that utilize scan data. In addition, SC provides support for commercial tools to generate test patterns without having the obfuscation key. This will help perform the manufacturing test before the activation of chips, and thus preventing IC overproduction.<br/> <br/>The proposed research will serve a critical need for the industry and government by working to support trust in the semiconductor manufacturing and test process. The integration of education and research is a key objective of this project. This research is multidisciplinary, linking the fields of IC design, simulation and test, hardware security, and embedded systems. The graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will receive interdisciplinary training across diverse areas of electrical and computer engineering. A novel upper-division course on hardware security for the graduate and undergraduate students will create a next-generation cybersecurity workforce for the government and commercial sectors.<br/> <br/>The artifacts expected as outcomes from this project will be publicly accessible during the period of performance and afterwards.

For each unit (e.g., city, state, or region) affected by the intervention of interest, a synthetic control is a combination on unaffected units chosen to resemble the characteristics of the treated units before the intervention. Synthetic controls are used to estimate the outcomes that affected units would have attained in the absence of the intervention of interest, providing a benchmark against which researchers can evaluate policy impacts. The synthetic control method was originally developed for cases with one or a small number of aggregate units affected by the policy of interest. However, the applied literature has surpassed the methodological contributions in this area. In particular, many current applications focus on settings with a large number of affected units. As a result, additional methodological research is needed to guide the empirical implementation of the method. This research will provide empirical researchers with a robust and general framework for estimation and inference with synthetic controls as well as freely available software with which to implement it.<br/><br/>When disaggregated data are available, constructing separate synthetic controls for each treated unit helps avoid interpolation biases. However, the problem of finding a synthetic control that best reproduces the characteristics of a treated unit may not have a unique solution, and multiplicity of solutions is a particularly daunting challenge in settings with many treated units. This research will provide a generalized synthetic control framework for estimation and inference. The framework builds on synthetic controls and introduces a penalization parameter that trades off pairwise matching discrepancies with respect to the characteristics of each unit in the synthetic control against matching discrepancies with respect to the characteristics of the synthetic control unit as a whole. It can be shown that, as long as the penalization parameter is positive, the generalized synthetic control estimator is unique and sparse. The investigators propose data driven choices for the penalization parameter, as well as inferential methods for synthetic controls in settings with many treated units.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The focus areas are in cardiovascular disease, breast milk banks, and assisted living facilities. There is a need for early diagnosis of heart failure, especially myocardial infarction, by monitoring cardiac biomarkers. This is not only for the patient's survival, but also reducing treatment costs. This biosensor technology will potentially be the first product on the market for a portable, rapid and cost-effective diagnosis of cardiovascular disease (CVD). This project may accelerate POC diagnostics research and personalized medicine, including early detection and screening, clinical diagnosis, treatment, prevention and control. Thus, it will permit a more effective deployment of therapies. The developed product is expected to find broader commercial applications including, but not limited to, preclinical and clinical researchers, life science studies, hospital and healthcare facilities, diagnostics and patient monitoring, home and remote use, as well as drug discovery in pharmaceutical and biotechnology industry.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the market potential for the innovative biosensor. The end product will be a lab-on-a-chip based POC technology for use in complex biological media, like whole blood, which commonly requires sample pretreatment and/or separation of the large blood cells. The POC device will provide exclusive delivery of protein biomarkers (e.g. troponin) to the detection area for highly sensitive and reliable detection from a drop of whole blood. The uniqueness of the innovation lies in the nanoscale structures that are fabricated into thin metal films and integrated with microfluidics for direct optical measurement. The combination of on-chip/in-line sample preparation and fluid handling integrated with a simple, label-free, optical detection system enables a complete lab-on-chip system. This system may offer several advantages over conventional biomarker detection methods for use in complex samples. These include high throughput, high sensitivity, elimination of interferences from large blood cells, lower cost, ease of operation and simplified sample pretreatment. The I-Corps project attempts to explore innovative applications of parallel, multiple biomarker analysis and determine the readiness to transition the biosensor to a viable product.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The completed dataset and full documentation will be widely shared and made publicly available at the end of the project. This will contribute to efforts to understand the dynamics of political violence and state repression, and the sources of instability and conflict in highly centralized authoritarian regimes. Data and analysis generated by this project will be valuable for the crafting of policy toward such regions.<br/><br/><br/>The dataset compiled in this project will permit the analysis of the endogenous formation of factional identities during political upheavals, while at the same time gauging the impact of exogenous structural features of localities and populations on levels of political mobilization and collective violence. Three structural features of particular interest are ethnic and sub-ethnic populations in an ethnically diverse region, prior divisions within local political networks, and the degree of party-state penetration across 86 rural counties and cities. The dataset will permit the analysis of the factors that influenced the origins and evolution of a highly complex upheaval over the course of several years (1966-1969) that included the collapse of local civilian governments, a popular insurgency that divided into two violently opposed armed factions, widespread and systematic intervention by military units, and overwhelming levels of state repression in order to rebuild local governments. The anticipated analyses will employ event count models, event history analysis, and network analysis to analyze the initial formation of factions and the subsequent evolution of collective violence.

Thwaites and neighboring glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment are rapidly losing mass in response to recent climate warming and related changes in ocean circulation. Mass loss from the Amundsen Sea Embayment could lead to the eventual collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, raising the global sea level by up to 2.5 meters (8 feet) in as short as 500 years. The processes driving the loss appear to be warmer ocean circulation and changes in the width and flow speed of the glacier, but a better understanding of these changes is needed to refine predictions of how the glacier will evolve. One highly sensitive process is the transitional flow of glacier ice from land onto the ocean to become a floating ice shelf. This flow of ice from grounded to floating is affected by changes in air temperature and snowfall at the surface; the speed and thickness of ice feeding it from upstream; and the ocean temperature, salinity, bathymetry, and currents that the ice flows into. The project team will gather new measurements of each of these local environmental conditions so that it can better predict how future changes in air, ocean, or the ice will affect the loss of ice to the ocean in this region.  <br/>  <br/>Current and anticipated near-future mass loss from Thwaites Glacier and nearby Amundsen Sea Embayment region is mainly attributed to reduction in ice-shelf buttressing due to sub-ice-shelf melting by intrusion of relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water into sub-ice-shelf cavities. Such predictions for mass loss, however, still lack understanding of the dominant processes at and near grounding zones, especially their spatial and temporal variability, as well as atmospheric and oceanic drivers of these processes. This project aims to constrain and compare these processes for the Thwaites and the Dotson Ice Shelves, which are connected through upstream ice dynamics, but influenced by different submarine troughs. The team's specific objectives are to: 1) install atmosphere-ice-ocean multi-sensor remote autonomous stations on the ice shelves for two years to provide sub-daily continuous observations of concurrent oceanic, glaciologic, and atmospheric conditions; 2) measure ocean properties on the continental shelf adjacent to ice-shelf fronts (using seal tagging, glider-based and ship-based surveys, and existing moored and conductivity-temperature-depth-cast data), 3) measure ocean properties into sub-ice-shelf cavities (using autonomous underwater vehicles) to detail ocean transports and heat fluxes; and 4) constrain current ice-shelf and sub-ice-shelf cavity geometry, ice flow, and firn properties for the ice-shelves (using radar, active-source seismic, and gravimetric methods) to better understand the impact of ocean and atmosphere on the ice-sheet change.  The team will also engage the public and bring awareness to this rapidly changing component of the cryosphere through a ""Live from the Ice"" social media campaign in which the public can follow the action and data collection from the perspective of tagged seals and autonomous stations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When char interacts with water, some of it dissolves and is carried away by rivers to the ocean.  This soluble component of char is termed ""dissolved black carbon"" (DBC).  Recent research has revealed DBC to be a major component of the carbon cycle.  Most notably, DBC is now known to make up 10% of all dissolved organic carbon that rivers carry to the sea.  Once in the ocean, DBC remains there for thousands of years, storing carbon that would otherwise be in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.  As carbon dioxide contributes to the greenhouse effect, with higher carbon dioxide in the atmosphere leading to warmer global temperatures, it is important to understand where DBC in the ocean came from and how long it will stay locked away in the deep ocean.  In this funded work, we set out to determine the source of the DBC in the ocean.  Based upon our previous work that shows rivers export massive amounts of DBC to the coast, it has been suggested that rivers are the main source of DBC to the open ocean.  However, in looking more closely at the DBC in rivers and the oceans, we found them to differ in one critical way: they have different isotopic signatures.  This precludes them from having the same source, indicating that the DBC in the oceans is not from rivers.  Our preliminary work only looked at a small river in Georgia, USA, and in the coastal waters offshore.  In this funded project, we will take a global look at the isotopic signatures of DBC collected from large rivers such as the Amazon, Mississippi, and Yukon, and from the middle of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  If we find there is no overlap in the isotopes of the DBC from these major global rivers and ocean waters, we can conclude that rivers are not the main source of oceanic DBC and will need to search for new explanations of how molecules produced by fire end up in the deep ocean.  <br/><br/>The project will enhance the career and continue the training of a first-time investigator and train undergraduate students in real world research through the Northeastern University Cooperative Program.  In addition, our findings be adapted to produce learning materials for high school students in collaboration with the Science Journal for Kids.<br/><br/>Previous efforts to track DBC sources in natural waters have come with major limitations, preventing definitive connections to be made between oceanic DBC and its pyrogenic source.  Photodegradation, a significant removal process for DBC in surface waters, drastically alters the molecular composition of DBC and erases any potential link between DBC chemical composition and its source.  Bulk stable carbon isotopic measurements cannot unambiguously identify sources of DOC subcomponents, such as DBC.  As such, this project aims to constrain the oceanic source of DBC by measuring compound-specific stable carbon isotopes of molecular markers (benzenepolycarboxylic acids, or BPCAs), derived exclusively from DBC.  Our preliminary data show BPCA-specific isotopic values to have a sufficiently wide dynamic range between riverine and oceanic samples to test our hypotheses.  In the current proposal, we aim to 1) isotopically characterize the largest quantified flux of DBC to the ocean (global rivers), 2) assess in situ oceanic variation in DBC stable carbon isotopic signatures, and 3) investigate the potential BPCA-specific fractionation effects of DBC photodegradation.  In establishing a robust tracer for DBC source, we will be able to accurately constrain sources of oceanic DBC and further investigate the biogeochemical cycling of DBC across the terrestrial-marine continuum.  The results of our research will also assist in answering larger research questions, specifically those regarding the fate of terrigenous DOM in the ocean, which have plagued biogeochemists for decades.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From fish to frogs to humans, all of the ~60,000 vertebrate species on earth use sophisticated immune cells to ""inspect"" every other cell in their body to determine if it is friend or foe. These immune cells possess a large number of protein receptors on their surface that work to maintain the peace. Many of these receptors are designed to recognize specific types of pathogens, forming a front line of defense. However, pathogens typically reproduce quickly, allowing them to evolve or change faster than most vertebrates and thereby develop ways to escape detection. In response, vertebrates have evolved a complex immune system that includes large groups of receptors that evolve faster than most other proteins and are specialized for anticipated as well as unanticipated pathogens. Fish represent half of all vertebrates and, as a group, are a great model for studying the genetic basis of these defenses. This project will use new and existing genomic data from numerous fish species to determine the origins of these receptors and study how these receptors have evolved to achieve the diversity observed today. Using fish as a model, this work will reveal fundamental aspects of immunity in all vertebrates. Data collected from this project will be incorporated into multiple new exhibits at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.<br/><br/>Ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) constitute over half of the extant vertebrates on earth, making them a powerful system for understanding the genetic and functional evolution of immune genes. Fish not only share certain immune gene families with mammals, but also encode a number of highly diverse ""fish-specific"" immune gene families. Understanding the factors that underlie the diversification of gene families involved in immunity is critical for explaining the origins and sub-/neo-functionalization of new genes and for understanding the molecular basis of pathogen recognition and resistance. In order to provide an in-depth understanding of the origins of vertebrate immune gene families and their diversification dynamics, this project will integrate a phylogenetic comparative framework with new and existing transcriptome and genomic sequence data from multiple ray-finned fish lineages to determine how genomic architecture impacts the rate and mechanism of gene family evolution. This project will also evaluate the interdependence between genetically encoded markers of self and their candidate receptors. In total, this project will illuminate the evolution of recognition mechanisms that delineate self from non-self in all ray-finned fish, and reveal novel insight into both conserved and divergent means of accomplishing this critical immune function. Finally, this project will enable the creation of media content and interactive exhibits at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences including a virtual reality and augmented reality video-game that teaches visitors fundamental aspects of how immune systems function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Elements of project-based learning and action learning theories will frame the research, although much of the extant research on registered apprenticeships is either descriptive or atheoretical, or it is grounded in economic theories that are principally concerned with explaining an employer's incentive to provide apprenticeship training.  The results of the project will support the implementation and expansion of STEM apprenticeship programs and guide the design of new comparable STEM training programs. <br/><br/>The investigator will use data from the Registered Apprenticeship Partners Information Data System (RAPIDS) and state data from Virginia and Washington to answer research questions investigating the characteristics of STEM apprentices and apprenticeship programs and whether they vary over time and across different fields, completion rates for STEM apprentices and determinants of program completion for these workers, and level of wage growth apprentices achieve upon completion of their apprenticeship. The analysis will be conducted in two overlapping stages. First, multivariate modeling using administrative data on registered apprenticeship will examine the prevalence of the apprenticeship training model in STEM occupations and the characteristics of apprentices in these fields. The administrative data also track apprentice outcomes, including progress through and completion of the program and wage rates for completers. These data will be used for multivariate modeling of the determinants of apprentice outcomes. The findings from the multivariate models of apprentice outcomes will inform the development of protocols for the second stage of the analysis - content analysis of apprenticeship work process schedules and interviews with representatives of STEM apprenticeship programs. The interviews will explore how apprenticeship training supports workforce development, promising strategies for STEM apprenticeships, and the strengths and weaknesses of the training model.

However, the existing visualization techniques need to be improved to support interpretation of data in applications with a large number of events that vary in frequency, accuracy, and timing. This project will create new visualization encoding and interaction design techniques that will advance the state of the art for understanding long streams of event sequences. Techniques will be validated for general uses as well as in a case study on type 1 diabetes treatment decision support. This research will afford more effective data exploration and decision-making tools for analyzing temporal data, applicable to many domains. The resulting visualization techniques will benefit clinicians and patients performing intensive insulin management for type 1 diabetes by enabling them to reduce the burden of care and improve outcomes. In addition, there are immediate applications to the treatment of chronic heart failure as well as non-health domains such as data centers monitoring cyber security. The outreach efforts in this research will disseminate the findings to the type 1 diabetes community, including both caregivers and patients, as well as encourage teenage girls to pursue careers in STEM. <br/><br/>This research will advance the state of the art in visualization and visual analytics for long streams of temporal event sequences with multidimensional, interrelated data. It will create methodologies for: (1) folding and reconfiguring long event sequences to align by dual non-periodic sentinel events; (2) scaling time axes between dual aligned events to show time distributions; (3) dual-event alignment of overlapping units of folded and reconfigured event sequences with data duplication; (4) compositing data from multiple event sequence sources to enable temporal inference with uncertain, erroneous, and missing data; and (5) displaying rapidly changing time series scalar values composited with point and interval event sequences at different time granularities and at different aggregation levels.

The answers are also important for predicting whether threatened plant populations can persist in the face of environmental change, or whether introduced species will become invasive in their new range.  Understanding mechanisms of adaptation to variable environments is, moreover, a fundamental problem in evolutionary biology.  The genetic model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (common name: thale cress) provides a unique opportunity to address this problem by synthesizing field measurements, genomic data, and geographic information, as outlined in this project. The results will be valuable to a wide range of scientists, from plant developmental biologists and population geneticists to plant ecologists and foresters.  The project will provide novel interdisciplinary research training for a graduate student, and all of the data will be publicly released to provide a community resource for further analysis and synthesis. <br/><br/>The research project will leverage data from field experiments with A. thaliana in which hundreds of genotypes originating in diverse climates across the native Eurasian range were grown together in common gardens in six sites across Eurasia and North America, along with known mutants in flowering time pathways.

The investigation will explore how many failures occur and their frequency, whether small landslides in an area make the slope resistant to large landslides, and  what types of landslides generate tsunamis. Recent work off the northwest coast of the U.S. has shown that small landslides on continental margins occur more frequently than previously thought. The small landslides are caused by shaking generated by both local and remote earthquakes. Changes in the overlying water column were also found to be important in generating the small landslides. In this new study off New Zealand, seafloor sensor data will be combined with other available geophysical, water column, and meteorological data, to evaluate whether the results of the Cascadia work on the stability of submarine slopes can be generalized to other subduction zone margins.

Studies done off Cascadia show that slope failures can occur either spontaneously or be triggered by identifiable events that include oceanographic processes or by seismic waves generated by local or remote earthquakes. The mechanisms and key attributes of these triggering seismic waves (e.g., frequency content, duration, etc.) remain speculative. Preliminary results also indicate that the geologic structure and topography of the accretionary wedge have profound impacts on the seismic loading. Sediment slope failures and flows also can be triggered by storms, tides, upper water column eddies and circulation changes. This study tests these ideas by analyzing new data from seafloor sensors that were deployed on the Hikurangi margin off New Zealand in 2015. These data will also be used to examine the signature of slow slip events on the shallow plate interface.

They are often thousands of meters below the surface of the ocean along the large volcanic mountain ranges called the mid-ocean ridges. Relatively little is known about these hydrothermal vents because they exist so far from the ocean surface. Instead of lava, these vents emit warm to hot fluids (from several ºC up to 350 ºC) into the ocean, and contain high concentrations of a wide range of dissolved chemicals. One of these chemicals, iron, has been studied extensively by ocean scientists because of its importance as an essential nutrient for the microscopic photosynthetic algae called phytoplankton that grow in surface ocean waters. Scientists once thought that most of the dissolved iron coming out of hydrothermal vent fluids would quickly precipitate (form a solid and sink) near the vents, as a result of chemical reactions between the hot vent fluid and cold seawater, and therefore only small amounts of dissolved iron could be transported from the deep sea mid-ocean ridges to surface waters where phytoplankton grow. However, on a recent scientific expedition over one of the most active mid-ocean ridges called the southern East Pacific Rise (SEPR), scientists discovered that much of the dissolved iron discharged from the SEPR hydrothermal vents was in fact transported thousands of kilometers across the deep ocean. In addition, computer simulations suggest that a substantial amount of this ?hydrothermal iron? is transported as far as the surface waters of the Southern Ocean around Antarctica, where it could support the growth of phytoplankton.<br/><br/>Scientists from the University of Washington, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Old Dominion University will return to the SEPR aboard a research ship and make additional measurements to better understand how hydrothermal vents add dissolved iron to the deep ocean. They will use specialized sampling equipment, including unmanned miniature submarines called autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs), to map the distribution of hydrothermal vents in this region, and collect water samples from both high temperature (250-350 ºC) and low temperature (< 150 ºC) vents.  These samples will be analyzed for chemicals that are enriched in the hydrothermal vent fluids, such as iron, manganese and helium-3, which will provide information on the chemical changes that occur as the hydrothermal vent fluids mix with surrounding seawater and are carried away from the SEPR.  The scientists will use their observations and chemical analyses to address the following major questions: 1) are there more hydrothermal vents along mid ocean ridges than previously thought? and (2) are low temperature hydrothermal vents especially favorable for stabilizing dissolved iron, and ultimately transporting it to the surface ocean where it supports phytoplankton growth? <br/><br/>The project will contribute to the education and training of a graduate student and two senior undergraduate students, and outcomes will be incorporated into high school STEM curricula.  The research activities will be communicated via public lectures and media releases, and project results will be disseminated to the scientific community by conference presentations, publications in peer-reviewed scientific journals, and freely available on-line archived data.<br/><br/><br/><br/>Along thousands of kilometers of the seafloor volcanic chains known as the mid-ocean ridges, hydrothermal vents discharge hot, acidic, metal-rich fluids into the deep ocean. These submarine hot springs are a major gateway for the exchange of heat and chemicals between the solid earth and the deep ocean, and have received intensive scientific study during the last 40 years.  This research has overwhelmingly focused on high temperature (~200-350°C) hydrothermal vents.  Lower temperature (<150°C) hydrothermal venting has received relatively little attention, although results from recent observational and modeling studies point to the greater abundance of low temperature discharge along the mid-ocean ridges, and its potential importance for the input of elements and chemical compounds into the deep ocean.  Among the elements that are enriched in hydrothermal vent fluids, iron has received attention because of its role as an essential nutrient for primary production in the surface ocean.  It has long been thought that most of the dissolved iron discharged by hydrothermal vents is lost from solution close to mid-ocean ridge sources, and thus of limited importance for ocean chemistry.  But this view has been challenged by recent studies which suggest that chemical stabilization of hydrothermal dissolved iron may facilitate its long-range transport in the deep ocean. In particular, results from the US GEOTRACES program have revealed the lateral transport of a plume of hydrothermal dissolved iron over several thousand kilometers westward from its source region on the southern East Pacific Rise (SEPR).<br/><br/>In this project, investigators from the University of Washington, Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and Old Dominion University will carry out a field research program on the SEPR to test the overarching hypothesis that diffuse low-temperature hydrothermal venting is a major a source of chemically-stabilized dissolved iron to the deep ocean, and hence plays an important but previously overlooked role in the ocean iron cycle.  The ship-based field program will use an autonomous underwater vehicle equipped with in-situ optical and chemical sensors to identify plumes of both diffuse (low-temperature) and discrete (high-temperature) hydrothermal discharge along the SEPR.  Emissions from multiple sites of both low and high temperature hydrothermal venting will be sampled for shipboard and post-cruise analyses of iron and other trace metals, and the inert hydrothermal ""tracer"" helium-3.  The resulting data will be used to test two specific hypotheses: (1) the population of active hydrothermal discharge sites along mid ocean ridges is greater than previously estimated, (2) low temperature hydrothermal venting is conducive to the chemical stabilization of dissolved iron, thus facilitating its export to the ocean interior and ultimately to surface ocean where it supports primary production by phytoplankton.  The information obtained in this research will facilitate inclusion of iron and other trace elements in numerical models of ocean biology and biogeochemistry, which will improve the ability to predict how the ocean will respond to and modulate future climatic and environmental changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These transformations occur quickly and automatically in literate adults, despite the fact that written language is a relatively recent cultural invention and that reading is something learned in school rather than acquired without formal teaching. Rapid advances have been made in the understanding of how people read words - both in terms of better models of the computational processes involved in these transformations and better understanding of how the brain responds to written stimuli. This project aims to bridge these computational and cognitive neuroscience approaches, using brain activity data from neuroimaging studies to answer some fundamental questions about how people read. What code does the brain use to recognize written words? How do individuals differ in how they process written words? Do people read words differently depending on the context in which they are read? In answering these questions, the ultimate goal of this research is to develop a neurocognitive theory of reading that can provide critical insights into how people read words. This in turn can benefit society by informing literacy education, the treatment of learning disabilities or the remediation of language loss after brain injury.<br/><br/>This project's goal will be achieved by collecting functional neuroimaging data while people read, and analyzing it with an approach that maps between different cognitive reading processes and different patterns of brain activity. By using this approach, the PI can identify the pattern of brain activity elicited by individual stimuli, and calculate the similarity in the pattern between all pairs of stimuli. They can then compare these brain-based similarity measures to formal predictions of similarity derived from computational models of reading. Consider how DOUGH relates to the words TOUGH, SEW and BREAD; DOUGH is spelled similarly to TOUGH, sounds similar to SEW, and has a meaning related to BREAD. Using the logic of this analysis, brain regions in which DOUGH elicits a similar response to TOUGH, but not to BREAD or SEW can be interpreted as regions involved in the neural representation of word spellings. In this way, the current approach provides a tool for linking neural activity to cognitive operations. Using this technique, the proposed research will test competing computational models of the front end of the reading system, evaluate how differences in a task alter reading-related processes and assess individual differences in the cognitive processes used by skilled readers. This project will advance research methods in bridging computational theories of cognition and neuroscience data that could be useful for many questions in cognitive science. Along the same lines, the project includes the educational goal of developing new approaches to teaching students from high school, through college, and into graduate school how to think about the relationship between brain data and cognitive theories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We rarely pay attention to the scene's low-level properties such as luminance values at various spots unless we are asked to report them, and even then, we are not very accurate about them. The fact that higher-level properties of a scene are more relevant to our behavior than low-level properties has informed global precedence theories of perception. However, experimental studies of the brain have established that lower-level features in a scene are detected before higher-level features; this result somehow led to the commonly used, but rarely tested, assumption that visual perception follows the same low-to-high-level hierarchy of feature detection. This project attempts to resolve this apparent contradiction by separating feature detection and perception, and by integrating visual perception and working memory, the brain's short-term storage of relevant visual information. The project will provide a new computational framework for understanding perception and memory which challenges traditional theories.<br/><br/>Technically, vision can be viewed as involving both encoding and decoding. Encoding refers to how visual stimuli evoke sensory responses in the brain whereas decoding concerns how these responses eventually lead to the subjective perception of the stimuli. A common assumption of many existing models is that decoding follows the same low-to-high-level hierarchy as encoding, but this was never rigorously tested. Additionally, under natural viewing conditions, the small fovea and frequent saccades introduce delays between sensory encoding of different parts of a scene and perceptual integration of the whole scene, suggesting that working memory must be involved in perceptual decoding; yet previous decoding models do not consider working memory. This project aims to address these issues using psychophysical and computational methods, with the specific goal of elucidating the nature of decoding hierarchy in light of working-memory properties. Specifically, compared with lower-level stimulus features, higher-level features are more invariant and categorical, thus requiring less information to specify and permitting more stable maintenance in noisy working memory. The brain should therefore prioritize decoding of reliable higher-level features and then use them to constrain and improve the decoding of unstable lower-level features in memory (when necessary). The project will test some surprising predictions of this retrospective Bayesian decoding theory and develop a neural network implementation of the theory.<br/> <br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the reported changes have been biased towards fishes and stony corals, and for Caribbean reefs, the most notable example of this bias are octocorals (""soft corals""). Although they are abundant and dominate many Caribbean reefs, they are rarely included in studies due to the difficulty of both identifying them and in quantifying their abundances.  In some places there is compelling evidence that soft corals have increased in abundance, even while stony corals have become less common.  This suggests that soft corals are more resilient than stony corals to the wide diversity of disturbances that have been impacting coral corals. The best coral reefs on which to study these changes are those that have been studied for decades and can provide a decadal context to more recent events, and in this regard the reefs of St. John, US Virgin Islands are unique. Stony corals on the reefs have been studied since 1987, and the soft corals from 2014.  This provides unrivaled platform to evaluate patterns of octocoral abundance and recruitment; identify the patterns of change that are occurring on these reefs, and identify the processes responsible for the resilience of octocoral populations. The project will extend soft coral monitoring from 4 years to 8 years, and within this framework will examine the roles of baby corals, and their response to seafloor roughness, seawater flow, and seaweed, in determining the success of soft corals. The work will also assess whether the destructive effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria have modified the pattern of change. In concert with these efforts the project will be closely integrated with local high schools at which the investigators will host marine biology clubs and provide independent study opportunities for their students and teachers. Unique training opportunities will be provided to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a postdoctoral researcher, all of whom will study and work in St. John, and the investigators will train coral reef researchers to identify the species of soft corals through a hands-on workshop to be conducted in the Florida Keys.<br/><br/>Understanding how changing environmental conditions will affect the community structure of major biomes is the ecological objective defining the 21st century.  The holistic effects of these conditions on coral reefs will be studied on shallow reefs within the Virgin Islands National Park in St. John, US Virgin Islands, which is the site of one of the longest-running, long-term studies of coral reef community dynamics in the region. With NSF-LTREB support, the investigators have been studying long-term changes in stony coral communities in this location since 1987, and in 2014 NSF-OCE support was used to build an octocoral ""overlay"" to this decadal perspective. The present project extends from this unique history, which has been punctuated by the effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, to place octocoral synecology in a decadal context, and the investigators exploit a rich suite of legacy data to better understand the present and immediate future of Caribbean coral reefs. This four-year project will advance on two concurrent fronts: first, to extend time-series analyses of octocoral communities from four to eight years to characterize the pattern and pace of change in community structure, and second, to conduct a program of hypothesis-driven experiments focused on octocoral settlement that will uncover the mechanisms allowing octocorals to more effectively colonize substrata than scleractinian corals on present day reefs.  Specifically, the investigators will conduct mensurative and manipulative experiments addressing four hypotheses focusing on the roles of: (1) habitat complexity in distinguishing between octocoral and scleractinian recruitment niches, (2) the recruitment niche in mediating post-settlement success, (3) competition in algal turf and macroalgae in determining the success of octocoral and scleractian recruits, and (4) role of octocoral canopies in modulating the flux of particles and larvae to the seafloor beneath. The results of this study will be integrated to evaluate the factors driving higher ecological resilience of octocorals versus scleractinians on present-day Caribbean reefs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The grant allows the design and investigation of artificial muscle fibers fabricated from electrospinning technique. Artificial muscle materials can generate an active deformation and force when subjected to external stimuli, behaving like real muscle.  Previously developed artificial muscle materials have often suffered from poor scalability and slow response, which greatly limit their applications. Consequently, performance of artificial muscle has been increasingly recognized as one of the bottlenecks in designing novel soft robots and active structures. The artificial muscle material in this grant will have superior mechanical properties, a faster response rate, diverse actuating modes and excellent scalability. These new materials will contribute to the rapidly developing fields of soft robotics, novel actuators and energy conversion systems. The project will also provide interdisciplinary education and training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students and seeks to attract underrepresented groups into science and engineering. Short disseminated demonstrations of artificial muscles to be developed will serve as an attractive education and research platform for disadvantaged, first generation high school and college students.<br/><br/>The artificial muscle assembled from electrospun polymer fibers can be easily fabricated into different shapes with various actuating modes, scaled up and down to various sizes, made to respond to different stimuli. A comprehensive understanding of processing-structure-property relationship for the electrospun polymer fibers is essential for the rational design of the artificial muscle fibers. The research team will electrospin three different types of polymer fibers: semicrystalline polyamide, polyelectrolyte and liquid crystal polymer, conduct systematic chemo-thermo-mechanical characterizations of these individual fibers using novel electrospinning tools, and design artificial muscle with diverse actuating modes by assembling these polymer fibers into different patterns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will focus on the impacts of increased housing costs on middle-income renters and how their perceptions of housing cost change and their experiences of neighborhood change impact their decisions to move or not move.  This project will contribute to a growing body of scholarly literature regarding neighborhood change and residential mobility.  It will increase basic understanding of population dynamics in urban areas by examining and the reasons that middle-income residents move in a changing city.  Because this project will identify the specific factors that influence residential mobility or immobility in middle-income renters, project findings will enable policymakers and housing developers to better understand and serve the needs of middle-income residents in competitive housing markets and will facilitate development of more effective policy interventions aimed at middle-income residents.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>Many urban areas in the United States have high and increasing housing costs.  In the ten years following the 2008 global financial crisis, the number of renters in the United States has increased in every income group, indicating that households who previously would have owned their homes now are renting.  The doctoral student conducting this research project will address two specific sets of research questions:  (1) How are new housing development, commodification of housing, and increased housing prices related to the spatial distribution of middle-income residents and middle-income affordable rentals?  (2) How do housing costs affect middle-income renters' perceptions of housing affordability, provide information about their decisions to move or stay, and impact their experience of neighborhood change?  The student will employ a mix of research methods to answer these questions.  She will address the first question by analyzing census data to identify spatial relationships between housing investments and middle-income residential locations, she will develop a hedonic model of where middle-income affordable rentals are likely to be.  Geographically weighted regression will be used to analyze the geography of the relationship between investment and middle-income locations.  The student will address the second question using geo-narratives of residential histories to analyze the spatially and temporally specific reasons for household residential histories.  Semi-structured interviews with middle-income residents will provide insights into where they have lived, why they moved or did not move, and how they make sense of the broader processes of housing commodification, investment, and gentrification in their own residential experiences.  This study will investigate these questions through a case study in New York City, a high-cost U.S. city, but the findings will be applicable to other high-cost of living metropolitan areas in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, if a person were to explain how he knew that the crowd gathered in the street was rioting, he might point to the shouting of political slogans or tires lit on fire. In this instance, the riot would be the event. The slogan-shouting and tire-burning would be the subevents. Knowledge of subevents provides important information for characterizing events, and has great potential to benefit various event oriented applications, such as event detection, event visualization, event summarization and extreme event management. This project aims to acquire subevents from text corpora by recognizing various contextual patterns that contain subevents. This research on subevent identification will bring us one step closer to automatic event ontology construction, which organizes events based on their relations (subevent, precursor, consequence, cause, condition and purpose, etc.) with a central type of event. This project will integrate research with education, train and prepare the future NLP researchers as well as expose early undergraduate students and high school students to NLP research, with a focus on broadening participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/><br/>An initial subevent extractor has been developed that leverages a specific type of sentential and local context to recognize subevents.

The task of event coreference resolution aims to identify event mentions that refer to the same real world event, and coreferential event mentions can appear in distinct contexts from the same document or from multiple documents. In the proposed research, new contexts identified through event coreference resolution that contain subevents will be used to acquire more subevents from a text corpus.

The ship funds will support a variety  peer-reviewed NSF funded projects. <br/><br/>A technical Description:<br/>Over the past 17 years, and in the next five, the R/V Savannah has continued and will continue to<br/>demonstrate its ability to host a large number of scientific cruises with a broad spectrum of mission<br/>requirements by providing a vessel with excellent range and endurance for its class, robust overboard<br/>handling systems and the capacity to berth 16 scientists plus 6 crew. For example, federally-funded<br/>projects over the past two years used the R/V Savannah to assess the role of vitamin B-12 and nitrogen<br/>availability on the regulation of oceanic dimethylsulfoniopropionate (DMSP) and dimethylsulfide (DMS)<br/>across a 250 nautical mile transect from the inner continental shelf to the Sargasso Sea; to study soluble<br/>iron fluxing in continental shelf margins using benthic lander deployments to 2500 meters and sediment<br/>collections to 1000 meters off the North Carolina capes; to quantify the cryptic diet of the globally<br/>significant pelagic tunicate Dolioletta gegenbauri on the mid-shelf of the South Atlantic Bight, and to<br/>measure the health of fish stocks from northern Georgia waters to south Florida. The R/V Savannah has<br/>also supported Navy ship trials and shock tests, ONR glider operations and the maintenance of<br/>meteorological data buoys as well as a variety of educational programs. All of the aforementioned<br/>projects were federally funded by NSF, ONR or NOAA. 2018 and years following will have some<br/>continuing projects and new research activities, mostly supported with federal funds.<br/><br/>Purposefully designed with a large science berthing capacity, the R/V Savannah is well suited to provide<br/>learning opportunities in ocean and estuarine environments and to demonstrate oceanographic research<br/>methodologies to diverse student populations. In 2017, the R/V Savannah hosted 30 undergraduate, 40<br/>graduate students, 23 high school science teachers and students, and 19 observers across 25 cruises. In<br/>collaboration with Savannah State University, the R/V Savannah continued to host the two-day Research<br/>Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) cruise (OCE-1460457) in 2017, giving students from all over the<br/>U.S. the opportunity to experience life at sea aboard a working research vessel by conducting standard<br/>sampling regimes across the continental shelf to be used in student research papers.

We are witnessing accelerating technological advances in autonomous vehicles. As the degree of autonomy of vehicles increases and the nature of human-autonomy interactions becomes more complex, key questions that need to be asked are how to ensure safety and trust in human-autonomous vehicle interactions. On the one hand, high-profile incidents make clear the risks from ""overtrust"" or over-reliance on autonomous vehicles. On the other hand, ""undertrust"" may cause the neglect or under-utilization of automation. This work will be integrated into the graduate and undergraduate education on cyber-physical systems, as well as various Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) outreach programs for K-12 students.<br/><br/>The approach is to develop languages and algorithms for formally expressing and reasoning about trust in human-autonomous vehicle interactions. This includes new models that can represent a human's trust in autonomous vehicles, together with new formal methods that can use these models in a tractable manner to verify trust requirements. The key innovations include new methods to measure trust based on multi-modal sensing of human cognitive and physiological states, new methods to express and verify trust-based specifications, and new methods to explain trust-based decisions in human-autonomy interactions. If successful, this research will allow the formalization of trust in human-autonomous vehicle interactions and the design of autonomous vehicles that establish appropriate levels of trust.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These supernovae occur when the iron core of a massive star collapses to a neutron star. Releasing its gravitational binding energy in a violent explosion as neutrinos, the resulting neutron star, for a few seconds, outshines the rest of the observable universe.  Viewed as a nuclear physics laboratory, core-collapse supernovae produce the highest densities of matter and energy in the modern universe.  However, the precise mechanism of this explosion has not been unambiguously pinned down and this fifty-year old conundrum is one of the central remaining unsolved problems in theoretical astrophysics.  Supernova theory is an amalgam of much of physics, and represents one of the most complex computational problems of modern science. Supercomputers, such as Blue Waters, are essential to make progress in simulating and understanding the evolution of the supernova event and neutron star birth.  A solution to the core-collapse supernova problem would benefit ongoing efforts of observers and instrument designers in the U.S. and around the world engaged in projects to determine the origin of the elements, measure gravitational waves (LIGO), and other important physics experiments.<br/><br/>The project will conduct three-dimensional radiation/hydrodynamic simulations of core-collapse supernovae with the goal of constraining, and ultimately determining, the mechanism of explosion.  During this explosion process, a combination of high-density nuclear physics, multi-dimensional hydrodynamics, radiation transport, and neutrino physics determines whether and how the star explodes.   The project will use the newly developed and tested code FORNAX incorporating state-of-the-art microphysics and methodologies, with excellent scalability to beyond 100,000 cores per tasks.   Various observational diagnostics, such as neutrino and gravitational-wave signatures and residual neutron star masses and kicks, will be derived for all models calculated.  Supernova explosions and their products are central to the origin of the elements, the birth of pulsars and black holes, and the dynamics of galaxies and the interstellar medium, and a fundamental theoretical understanding of such explosions will inform the interpretation of data derived from, among other platforms, NASA's Chandra X-ray Observatory, the Hubble Space Telescope, Swift, NuStar, and the upcoming James Webb Space Telescope.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This unparalleled fossil assemblage allows rigorous studies of extinct mammal biology, especially of carnivores which are rare at most fossil sites. The La Brea fossils span a critical time in Earth's history (approximately 50,000 years ago to the present) that includes major events such as the end of the last Ice Age, the arrival of humans in North America, and an extinction that killed two thirds of the large mammals on the continent. This unique deposit will be used to investigate relationships between major environmental changes and evolutionary variation (size, diet, etc.) in large mammals, information that is critical for promoting the survival of wildlife today. The project involves significant community outreach in the greater Los Angeles area through the Tar Pits Museum and will create educational content that will be available online for high school teachers across the country.<br/><br/>	The major impediment to system-level study at Rancho La Brea is a paucity of radiocarbon dates and the resulting inability to correlate biotic change with time.

All genes in an organism use a simple, four-letter alphabet (A, C, G, T) to make three-letter words (codons) to specify each amino acid of a protein.  There is redundancy in this genetic code with multiple, similar codons often coding for the same amino acid.  In the DNA, the overall G+C content of genes within any given species is often very similar.  However, in grass species there are high-GC and low-GC genes, and there is evidence that high-GC and low-GC genes may be transcribed from DNA into RNA and translated from RNA into protein differently.  This project will test whether proteins from high-GC and low-GC genes are transcribed and translated with equal efficiency and, specifically, whether that differential regulation is used when responding to heat, cold and drought stress.  This work will also discover rules about codon usage and protein synthesis that can be used to design transgenes for efficient protein production.  Finally, current gene prediction software does not account for the high-GC and low-GC genes found in grasses.  This project will create a new gene prediction program that will more accurately predict genes in grasses.  Better gene prediction will benefit the larger community of plant researchers, including those who work with economically important grasses such as maize, rice, wheat, oats and barley.<br/><br/>Grass genes have a bimodal GC distribution and a significant 5' to 3' GC gradient.  Little is known about the consequence of such variation on gene and protein expression.  High gene GC content and strong negative 5' to 3' gradients in grasses strongly affect codon usage bias.  It is possible that both GC biased gene conversion and codon usage bias are important in shaping the unusual GC features that are found in grass genes.  GC biased gene conversion may help to move gene mutation towards a particular codon usage program, and then selection on that codon bias may maintain a gene's GC content and gradient. GC biased gene conversion in rice will be examined.  Transcriptional and translational characteristics of native and transgenes that differ only in their GC content will also be studied in rice. Translational efficiency may also be affected by regulation of tRNAs in a tissue or condition-specific manner.  Therefore, regulation of tRNAs will be examined to determine if changes in tRNA abundances affect protein translational efficiency.  Recent published data indicate that due to the variation of GC content in grass genes, a notable number of genes in grasses have been missed or mis-annotated by existing gene finders.  A new gene prediction tool that accounts for grass bimodal GC distribution will be designed to improve gene annotation in grasses.  The results from this project will provide novel insights into gene evolution in grasses as well as important guidance for crop improvement via genetic modification.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The analysis will use satellite images and an archive of recently recovered air-photos from historical expeditions.  Findings from the study will contribute to the limited knowledge of alpine glacier histories in remote regions, with implications for future estimates of ice loss and global sea-level change. The research will capitalize on a unique collection of historical air-photos, which have been underutilized as a source of data, thereby providing an opportunity to assess alpine glacier change on a regional scale.  This study will foster a new international collaboration with the Natural History Museum of Denmark and engage undergraduate students in polar geospatial research.

As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>Most previous studies of remote glaciers have been restricted to the satellite era of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. Thus, the long-term, Holocene, history of these glaciers and ice caps is generally not well known, despite their importance to global sea level. Of particular relevance to the future, their sensitivity to sustained periods of past warming is poorly understood. To facilitate improved estimates of past glacier activity as well as future glacier change, the doctoral student will utilize historical air-photos, Landsat and Worldview satellite data, as well as several open-sourced digital analytical tools to reconstruct historical glacier extent and area, and model glacier Equilibrium Line Altitude (ELA).  In combination with the related research which reconstructs long-term Holocene glacier histories using lake sediments in the same region, this complementary geospatial analysis will place 20th and 21th century glacier variability into a longer-term perspective. Although this research project will focus on alpine glaciers in South Greenland, it is highly relevant to understanding the impacts of global environmental change more broadly.  The study aims to develop improved approaches for the historical analysis of glacial change, which will be useful for natural resource management in many other locations, including within the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cold periods and frost episodes are still one of the worst enemies of grape and stone fruit production worldwide.  Grape and orchard production are highly linked to climatic conditions, making sub-seasonal weather variability and its connections to climate change a challenging issue for this economic sector. Growers may presently deploy fossil fuel heaters, sprinkler systems, the downward draft from helicopters and wind machines to fight spring frost damage. These methods are usually costly, some create environmental concerns, and in many cases they may be limited by water availability and area coverage.  Altering timing of bud break stages that are susceptible to frost injury appears to be a viable alternative to cope with current and emerging challenges of climate change. The proposed I-Corp program explores implementation and commercialization opportunities of an end-to-end solution. The innovation combines a bioactive, non-toxic biodegradable encapsulation technology (spray) that alters internal grapevine physiology and promotes bud break delay. A predictive analytic system provides recommendations to make informed decisions about frost risk management.<br/> <br/>This I-Corps project is based on a series of studies that have combined pruning management, biophysical and biochemical factors influencing the endogenous regulation of bud break, and resistance to cold injury.  In addition, the project combines this knowledge with an analytic data platform (software) that will analyze plant development as a function of environmental temperature (phenology), topographic and soil data, at the farm level.  Combination with global and regional patterns of climate patterns will aid understanding climate variability at high spatial and temporal scale. This platform will allow better prediction for decision making at the vineyard and orchard level to reduce some of the most significant challenges associated with prediction reliability about bud break and risk of frost.

This unparalleled fossil assemblage allows rigorous studies of extinct mammal biology, especially of carnivores which are rare at most fossil sites. The La Brea fossils span a critical time in Earth's history (approximately 50,000 years ago to the present) that includes major events such as the end of the last Ice Age, the arrival of humans in North America, and an extinction that killed two thirds of the large mammals on the continent. This unique deposit will be used to investigate relationships between major environmental changes and evolutionary variation (size, diet, etc.) in large mammals, information that is critical for promoting the survival of wildlife today. The project involves significant community outreach in the greater Los Angeles area through the Tar Pits Museum and will create educational content that will be available online for high school teachers across the country.<br/><br/>	The major impediment to system-level study at Rancho La Brea is a paucity of radiocarbon dates and the resulting inability to correlate biotic change with time. This project will intensively radiocarbon date samples from multiple pits spanning the last 50,000 years to establish the first detailed chronology for the entrapment of four extinct species of large mammals, and one extant species. It will involve the collection and compilation of census data for these species to track changes in total abundance and diversity, as well as data on morphological and dietary changes. A well-resolved chronology will allow these data on evolutionary changes in mammals and the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions to be linked to existing records of major paleo-environmental changes.

Transcription, the synthesis of RNA on the DNA template, is the first step in gene expression that largely defines which genes will be active. The key unanswered question is how transcription is regulated across the genome to generate stable, cell-type-specific patterns of gene expression. By combining classic biochemical approaches with global sequencing, this project will determine how specific transcription patterns may be stabilized by universal mechanisms targeting the enzymes responsible for RNA synthesis. By studying the process of transcription, the project will tackle a general problem of how multiple layers of information could be packed into, and extracted from, the same DNA sequence.<br/><br/>This project deals with the phenomenon of promoter-proximal RNA polymerase II (Pol II) pausing, which occurs within the first 100 nucleotides of many metazoan genes and is controlled by factors involved in most if not all Pol II-transcribed promoters. Pausing is established by the Negative ELongation Factor (NELF) and, apart from the well-known productive elongation, can be alternatively released without mRNA synthesis via premature termination. This project will investigate the roles of factors responsible for pause establishment and release in human mesenchymal stem cells undergoing adipocyte differentiation. Objective 1 will focus on establishing pausing to determine how NELF defines genes to be paused. The question will be addressed by perturbing the levels of NELF at various time scales and monitoring Pol II pausing distribution and dynamics using our published as well as new methods including 5'-capped RNA- sequencing and multiplex permanganate footprinting. Objective 2 will focus on pause release to determine how the decision between mRNA production versus termination regulates expression of genes in response to a model heat shock stimulus. The question will be addressed by combining Pol II ChIP-sequencing and global run-on assays with novel analysis of termination-specific small RNAs derived from paused complexes. By exploring Pol II pausing as a prominent yet still poorly understood phenomenon, a new principle organizing genes into networks may be uncovered. Students engaged into ongoing research will make more informed decisions on whether or not to pursue careers in science, which will elevate the reputation of basic science among general public especially in rural communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nonetheless, physicists started to understand the significant role of topology in physics since 1980's, and new types of materials called topological quantum matter are being discovered.  These materials possess unexpected properties which not only expand our knowledge but also functionality of the materials.  In general, these topological materials are composed of multiple elements with complex structures.  However, a form of helium, called helium-three isotope, becomes a topological matter when it is cooled down to a liquid form at extremely low temperature close to absolute zero.  At such conditions it forms a new state of matter called a superfluid that exhibits fascinating quantum phenomena.  In this project, the PI's research group investigates the nature of superfluid helium-three using a unique experimental technique employing small mechanical oscillators.  This project will expand our understanding on these unique properties of helium-three.  The research group is composed of graduate and undergraduate students working as a team.  They will be trained not only in the field of low-temperature physics but also in silicon nanofabrication technology from design to fabrication of specialized devices that have proliferated our modern world through their widespread use as sensors and actuators.<br/><br/>Technical Description: <br/>Growing interest in the surface Andreev bound states in p-wave superfluid 3He arises from the fact that it is arguably the most complete platform available to investigate the nature of topological excitations. The PI's group has developed a versatile and powerful experimental probe based on Micro-Electro-Mechanical System (MEMS) technology to study the surface Andreev bound states in this system.  The major activities are:  (i) Investigation of the topological surface states on a specular boundary for comprehensive understanding of the nature such as experimental evidence for Dirac fermions and a possible field-driven topological transition.  (ii) Investigation of the interactions between two surface states in close proximity.  (iii) Development of a sensitive quasiparticle flux sensor with a spatially resolved detection capability in the form of MEMS arrays.  This project, in close collaboration with theorists, will certainly expand our understanding of these unique excitations in a pristine topological superfluid.  Confirmation of the theoretically predicted topological transition induced by a small magnetic field would be one of the most convincing manifestation of a symmetry-protected topological superfluid and Majorana fermions in this system. The successful development of MEMS arrays will provide unprecedented opportunities to achieve spatially-resolved detection in 3He and 4He with many foreseeable applications: visualization of vortices and angle-resolved detection of quasiparticles in 3He, and momentum resolved roton-phonon detection and quantum turbulence study in He-II.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main novelty is to combine both images and videos together. The developed algorithms could have broad impact in numerous fields including AI, security, and agricultural sciences. In addition to scientific impact, the project performs complementary educational and outreach activities.

Currently blind people rely heavily on text-to-speech software and audiobooks to digest digital context. However, listening does not delivery the same sense of immediacy and literacy as reading braille. Also, audio technology and single line displays cannot deliver spatial information, e.g. mathematical equations, diagrams, and graphs, which are critical to literacy in science, technology, and math-related subjects.  Commercial electronic tactile displays exist, but due to the complexity and cost of the underlying technology, the devices are prohibitively expensive and are limited to a single line of braille. An affordable full-page tactile display delivering multiple lines of braille and tactile graphics would significantly improve blind people's access to digital technology. New technology can improve literacy rates, education outcomes and overall lifestyle of blind people. <br/><br/>The I-Corps project will assess the commercial viability of using a patented microfluidic technology for developing a full-page tactile display.

The pneumatic actuators are integrated directly into the microfluidic chip using large-scale integration, making the device low-cost and highly scalable. Pressure-based actuation ensures that even tightly placed features will maintain relatively high force outputs.

Modular industrial systems are built from small-scale, standardized equipment modules, which perform well-defined tasks. Standardization and size reduction enables mass fabrication and fast deployment of equipment, which accelerates experimentation and learning and ultimately leads to technology cost reductions. Modular systems enable staged (sequential) investment strategies, which provide flexibility to mitigate market and regulatory uncertainties. They also facilitate exploitation of highly dispersed resources that are deemed too expensive to centralize. The goal of this CAREER project is to develop optimization formulations and algorithms that facilitate the analysis and design of hierarchical modular systems.   These capabilities will be used to design flexible combined power fertilizer systems in rural areas that produce power, ammonia, and urea from distributed resources such as wind energy, natural gas, biomass, and organic waste. <br/><br/>Current industrial-scale process systems are highly customized and involve logistically-complex, expensive and lengthy construction phases. Identifying technologies that are suitable for modularization and determining appropriate degrees of enterprise-wide modularity can improve operational flexibility and mitigate financial risk. Large-scale industrial process systems that benefit from the economies of scale can evolve into a hybrid state in which certain functions will be performed in small modular systems that increase flexibility. To model these systems the use of hierarchical graph abstractions is proposed to provide a natural framework for analysis and optimization of the benefits of modularity. Graph abstractions enable the use of techniques to properly organize process equipment units into tightly integrated modules and can be applied recursively at higher levels where modules represent subsystems, entire production facilities, and local/regional/global supply chain hubs. Hierarchical graph structures will be exploited by combinatorial optimization and multi-stage stochastic programming techniques to derive scalable design and investment strategies that mitigate markets and regulatory risk.  The educational part of this project aims to incorporate new hierarchical decision-making concepts into the engineering curriculum, make the curriculum itself more modular and develop software tools that enable the design of complex hierarchical systems using crowd-sourcing. Planned outreach activities will provide K-12 students from schools with high enrollment of underrepresented minorities with opportunities to learn about the benefits of modular decision-making and motivate them to pursue career paths in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Knowledge of H is important for mesospheric and lower thermospheric heating, and for plasmaspheric and magnetospheric charging following geomagnetic storms. As the lightest neutral species in the atmosphere, H requires the lowest energy to overcome the Earth's gravitational force and escape into interplanetary space. Permanent loss of H has a significant impact on long-term atmospheric evolution.<br/><br/>Numerical models of exospheric H assume a population of collisional atoms. However, this assumption has long been known to be oversimplified. Recent measurements made by the PIs of non-thermal, high-energy H atoms in the upper thermosphere bear this out. The goals of this proposal are to refine the PI's radiative transfer models to reflect non-collisional H physics, and to identify the mechanisms that control the distribution and dynamical transport of H atoms in the terrestrial thermosphere and exosphere. The efforts will lead to further understanding of the structure, chemical coupling and energetics of the space-atmosphere interaction region. The work also sheds light on the evolution of the exosphere due to H escape. The new modeling capabilities and inversion techniques can be easily generalized for the study of other planetary atmospheres, particularly that of Mars.

The zone of slip between the two plates is a geologic fault where the motion of the lower plate is imperfectly transferred to the overlying plate through frictional processes allowing for unreleased strain to build up in the upper plate.  The abrupt release of built-up strain in the upper plate causes earthquakes, which can be large on subduction zones because of the size of the slip region. These great earthquakes cause damage both from the shaking itself but also because of the flooding of seawater from a tsunami. Recent events in Sumatra in 2004, Chile in 2010, and Japan in 2011 all demonstrate the devastating hazard associated with these events.  Subduction zones also lie offshore the US coasts along Northern California, Oregon and Washington State and another along Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.   Both of these subduction zones have experienced great earthquakes in the past and will do so again in the future. A goal of this project is to better understand the geophysical processes at work at subduction zones and to improve the quantitative assessment of potential hazard. This project will deploy a combination of seafloor geodetic sensors to track the slow buildup and possible release of seafloor motion offshore of a New Zealand subduction zone.  The New Zealand Hikurangi site was picked because the subduction zone is shallow and can be imaged more effectively with seafloor geodetic instruments.  This site also has a history of rapidly repeating slow slip earthquakes that provide insight into the slip process.  Broader impacts of this project include training and support for a graduate student in the research. The project leverages international efforts by New Zealand and Japanese research teams who will occupy adjacent seafloor geodetic sites. The project will also transfer operational know-how for how to conduct seafloor geodesy experiments to NZ research counterparts, enabling them to collect measurements at these critical sites during this proposed project and continue in the future past the end of the project.<br/><br/>This project will measure deformation near the trench of the New Zealand Hikuangi subduction margin over a four year period using the GPS-Acoustic (GPS-A) method. The GPS-A site will be established in the Hawkes Bay area to provide critical measurements centered between GPS-A sites in the northern and southern parts of the margin established using Japanese and New Zealand funding. This central site is near the transition from an apparently strongly coupled margin to the South, and a nearly uncoupled margin in the North.  The project will implement the more efficient and cost-saving Wave Glider platform for the GPS-Acoustic measurements. Permanent seafloor benchmarks will be installed for horizontal positioning to ensure the time series of positions can be continued into the future, past the end of this project. An array of absolute pressure gauges will also be deployed for two years to measure the offshore extent of slow slip events observed from land arrays beneath the Hawkes Bay area, a region thought to have experienced many >8 magnitude earthquakes in the past based on paleoseismology. The array is expected to detect vertical uplift and hence the spatial extent of at least one large slow slip event in this region during the deployment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This unparalleled fossil assemblage allows rigorous studies of extinct mammal biology, especially of carnivores which are rare at most fossil sites. The La Brea fossils span a critical time in Earth's history (approximately 50,000 years ago to the present) that includes major events such as the end of the last Ice Age, the arrival of humans in North America, and an extinction that killed two thirds of the large mammals on the continent. This unique deposit will be used to investigate relationships between major environmental changes and evolutionary variation (size, diet, etc.) in large mammals, information that is critical for promoting the survival of wildlife today. The project involves significant community outreach in the greater Los Angeles area through the Tar Pits Museum and will create educational content that will be available online for high school teachers across the country.<br/><br/>	The major impediment to system-level study at Rancho La Brea is a paucity of radiocarbon dates and the resulting inability to correlate biotic change with time. This project will intensively radiocarbon date samples from multiple pits spanning the last 50,000 years to establish the first detailed chronology for the entrapment of four extinct species of large mammals, and one extant species. It will involve the collection and compilation of census data for these species to track changes in total abundance and diversity, as well as data on morphological and dietary changes. A well-resolved chronology will allow these data on evolutionary changes in mammals and the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions to be linked to existing records of major paleo-environmental changes.

One level of this organization consists of DNA wrapped around histone proteins, and is called the chromatin. High-throughput chromatin conformation capture methods (one example is called the Hi-C assay) have been developed, and yield an immense amount of information about 3D genome organization. However, most current analysis tools cannot distinguish the Hi-C, or equivalent, information that comes from the paired (homologous) maternal and paternal chromosomes in diploid organisms (like humans and other mammals). This means it is not possible to tell if there are different effects arising from the maternal and paternal copies of genes (the alleles). This project will address this problem and allow the development of fine-scale, allele-specific chromatin structures and therefore shed light on the role(s) of chromatin interactions in allelic gene regulation as well as larger principles of genome organization. This research will result in novel computational and statistical methods that combine the analysis of allele-specific chromatin structure with gene expression regulation; the products will include open-source software tools for 3D genome modeling, comparison, visualization, and exploration. These software tools will be made publicly accessible to scientists worldwide. The integrated research and educational activities include curriculum development for both undergraduate and graduate courses in subjects including data science, and statistical and computational genomics. Activities will allow undergraduate students to participate in the research project, as well as training graduate student researchers to acquire interdisciplinary expertise. The project will reach out particularly to middle school students with the goal of engaging young women and underrepresented minority groups in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to (i) establish a new computational and statistical framework for modeling the 3D chromatin structures in an allele-specific manner; (ii) identify structural differences between homologous chromosome pairs; (iii) investigate the impact of chromatin organization on allelic gene regulation; and (iv) understand the interplay between genome architecture and gene function. The project will integrate fine-scale allele-specific chromatin structures with the currently overwhelming amount of one-dimensional functional genomics data to discover new allele-specific regulatory elements and features. The project will elucidate gene regulation principles at an unprecedented resolution, and enhance our understanding of the interplay between genome architecture and gene expression. These findings will have fundamental significance in molecular cell biology, personal genomics, and medicine.

The University of Kentucky is partnering with the Fayette County Public School to accomplish the project objectives, which include: (1) attract more diverse candidates to STEM teaching pathways, (2) strengthen collaborations between the College of Education and the Colleges of Arts & Sciences and Engineering to support a dual degree program in STEM education and a STEM discipline, (3) institutionalize wide-ranging support services to ensure student retention and success across the dual degrees, (4) increase the number of STEM education graduates, and (5) prepare STEM teachers in culturally responsive teaching and with strong content knowledge, including how to integrate energy and manufacturing challenges in the curriculum. The project aims to achieve these objectives through a three-pronged approach: (1) Recruiting--using a multi-faceted approach that will include promotion of a viral(readily accessible, engaging online) video, development of postcard brochures, social media ads, and collaborations with teacher pathway programs across the state; (2) Collaboration--staff and faculty across the three collaborating colleges will work together to provide candidates with support aimed at supporting the highest possible retention rates; and (3) Professional learning--academic year and summer professional learning opportunities will be provided to candidates while they are in the program and after they have gone into their own classrooms. The specific focus on underrepresented populations--both minority candidates and first-generation Appalachian candidates--will allow this project to align candidate placement with the demographics of either urban or rural school settings, enabling the new teachers to serve as models for success in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/><br/>This Noyce Track 1 Scholars project is designed to recruit 34 candidates (majors in any of the STEM disciplines) into STEM teaching careers. The goal is for 25% of those candidates to be in one or more of the following under-represented populations: (a) student of color; (b) first generation student as identified by the University of Kentucky?s definition; (c) student with a disability; and/or (d) student from Appalachia. Those candidates will be prepared to teach mathematics, science (biology, chemistry, physics, earth science) and computer science in high-needs secondary schools. Candidates will be afforded unique professional learning experiences within the program, such as work in informal STEM learning settings (e.g., the University of Kentucky SeeBlue STEM camp), industry externships (in partnership with Kentucky Advanced Manufacturing, KAM), and summer retreats with sessions focused on Common Cores State Standards in Mathematics or the Next Generation Science Standards. These experiences will be aligned with appropriate pedagogical approaches and real-world applications of content, including energy (in association with the Center for Applied Energy Research) and manufacturing (in association with KAM). Preparing candidates who can meet the needs of both rural and urban high-needs schools, meeting the increasing demand for qualified computer science teachers, and developing an undergraduate teacher preparation program with unique features such as informal STEM learning and industry externship experiences will be the most salient benefits of this project to STEM education in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These wounds affect 6.5 million patients in the US and this number is growing rapidly due to a drastic increase in the number of diabetics, the obese, and the elderly--all populations in which wound healing is impaired. Mesenchymal stem cells (commonly known as adult stem cells) and insulin applied to wound surfaces have each shown promise in healing otherwise unhealable wounds. Mesenchymal stem cells assist wound healing by secreting factors that promote actions critical to wound healing, such as new blood vessel formation, increases in the production of skin components, and recruitment of cells that clean wounds and form scar tissue. Insulin assists wound healing by recruiting mesenchymal stem cells and skin cells to the wound area.  Motivated by the recent observation that wounds treated with a combination of mesenchymal stem cells and insulin-producing cells healed faster than normal and without scarring, the objective of this project is to identify the type of insulin needed to achieve the observed accelerated healing and reduced scarring and to uncover the wound healing pathways that are recruited.  Research results have the potential to transform wound care by enabling rapid healing that would avert the morbidity and mortality associated with chronic wounds and to enhance reconstructive and plastic surgery outcomes by reducing or eliminating scar formation.  The project's long-term educational goal is to present future engineers with tissue engineering research in unfamiliar contexts, like aviation, to inspire innovative thinking for future careers in biomedical engineering. In pursuit of this goal, this project's educational objective is to apply research principles to teaching and to develop tissue engineering research modules that integrate research, teaching, mentorship, and learning for use in biomedical engineering course-based undergraduate research experiences (CUREs). The educational and outreach approach is to recruit female students, group them in teams and provide hands-on research activities with wound healing models that will enable them to formulate hypotheses and models, and to propose, conduct, and present experiments that will further their understanding of research. The women will be required to present their research in scientific meetings and to K-12 graders in an aviation science club.<br/><br/>The project's research focus is on investigating the impact of mesynchymal stem cells (MSCs) and insulin producing cells (IPCs), both individually and coencapsulated, on wound healing and its pathways, and on identifying how cell-cell vs. cell-wound interactions govern the secretome of encapsulated cells.  The project is motivated by recent studies from the PI's lab that achieved dramatically accelerated (14 vs 40 days), scar-free wound healing after combining these cells.  The research plan has four specific aims.  Aim 1 is to dissect, via in vitro studies, the role of IPCs vs insulin in survival and function of the coencapsulated cells, i.e., whether it is insulin itself, the presence of the IPCs or the hormone release that improves survival and function.  Aim 2 is to dissect, via in vivo studies in mice, the role of IPCs vs insulin in the accelerated wound healing, i. e, whether insulin-producing fibroblasts have the same effect as commercially available IPCs (RIN-5F and RIN-14B) that secrete additional products. Aim 3 is to determine the extent, via in vitro studies, that coencapsulation promotes MSC factor release in comparison to MSC factor release elicited by wound environments, i.e., whether the Akt signaling pathway, which is critical to MSC survival, is activated more strongly in MSCs coencapsulated with IPCs or in MSCs delivered singly to wounds.  Aim 4 is to determine the extent that IPCs+MSCs reduce scar formation, i.e., to extend the work to a limited study in pigs, which have an epidermis and dermis similar to human skin and heal at a comparable rate.  In summary, this project will examine the metabolic pathways involved in IPC+MSC wound healing, the interplay between the two cells and the wound environment, and whether lessons learned can be applied to other cell therapies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research explores the relationships between the science of vision, images, and the optical-psychological practices with images at a critical juncture of western civilization. Specifically, it focuses on relationships between understandings of optics and violent European religious iconoclasms that occurred during the early modern period. The researcher will show that common beliefs about the ways vision and visual psychology worked, and the different uses of that knowledge by artists on the one hand and theologians on the other, set religious art on a collision course with the Reformation understandings of the image. The connections between science, religion, and society that are to be revealed in this study will serve to create scholarly exchanges among those in the natural sciences, social sciences, visual arts, and several fields within the humanities. The results of this study will be integrated into curricular development at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and they will be disseminated in professional journals and conferences. Finally, there will be a conference to extend the trajectories of the main lines of inquiry of this research.<br/><br/>The overarching research question of this study addresses what the science of vision can teach us about iconoclastic violence. The researcher will engage in this study first setting out the understandings of optics in this period among different levels of society, then comparing textual evidence in Latin and vernacular religious texts alongside visual and text evidence from the artists. Scientific understandings today recognize vision, perception, and memory storage as physical processes that create both temporary and long-term changes to the brain. Early scientists also recognized the power of vision, especially when focused on images, to alter the mind physically. Those who urgently called for immediate destruction of religious images repeatedly point to the fact that the devout had confused the material image with the holy figure portrayed, and were treating the material object as though it were alive. As the Reformers point out, the optical habits of daily meditation on images, especially on images that appeared alive, caused the images to become physically part of the person's memory, and shaped the person's identity. The iconoclasts understood their image destruction to be destroying a deeply ingrained psychological part of the individual that was considered religiously pernicious.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Age information is crucial for reconstructing the rate and sequence of climate changes globally. Some sediments are well-dated using radiocarbon. However, the ages of many samples can only be estimated indirectly, resulting in age uncertainties as large as 4,000 years. This research project aims to improve these indirect age estimates using statistical analysis of the available radiocarbon-dated samples. Improvements in indirect age estimates will be used to increase the accuracy of global datasets of climate changes for the past 150,000 years.<br/><br/>More specifically, the aim of this project is to improve indirect age estimates derived from the stratigraphic alignment of benthic delta18O (a proxy for global ice volume and deep ocean temperature). A major source of uncertainty in these ages derives from differences of up to 4,000 years in the timing of benthic delta18O change observed at a few core sites with very accurate radiocarbon models. However, little is known about how the timing of benthic delta18O signals differs at other locations. The research approach for this project incorporates ocean circulation models, paleoclimate data (benthic delta18O and 14C from ~100 globally distributed sediment cores), and statistical inference. Phase one of the project is to characterize benthic delta18O age differences (delta18O lags) globally using radiocarbon data from ~100 sediment cores in conjunction with results from ocean circulation models. Phase two is to apply the results from phase one to develop improved methods for delta18O alignment. Phase three is to generate a new database of improved delta18O age models. Thus, the final products of the project will be (1) probabilistic stacks (averages) describing regional and global patterns of benthic delta18O variability, (2) probabilistic algorithms for multiproxy core alignments and for generating Bayesian inferences of delta18O lags, (3) a database of age models for ~300 cores with benthic delta18O data, and (4) estimates of ocean circulation changes based on comparing benthic del18O data with different circulation model scenarios.<br/><br/>This project has broader impacts for climate change research and education. Accurate paleoclimate age estimates are crucial for creating data compilations that are used to test the effectiveness of climate models and improve confidence in their ability to simulate potential future climate changes. The spatial coverage of paleoclimate data compilations is often increased by including data with indirect age estimates that have large uncertainties. By improving age estimates for benthic delta18O alignments and quantifying alignment age uncertainties, this project will allow for more informed selection of which data to include in compilations and overall better accuracy. Data-model comparison performed as part of this project will also better constrain ocean circulation changes, which could help describe the causal chain of events for past climate changes and may identify isolated reservoirs of carbon sequestered in the ocean during glaciations.

However, the reported changes have been biased towards fishes and stony corals, and for Caribbean reefs, the most notable example of this bias are octocorals (""soft corals""). Although they are abundant and dominate many Caribbean reefs, they are rarely included in studies due to the difficulty of both identifying them and in quantifying their abundances.  In some places there is compelling evidence that soft corals have increased in abundance, even while stony corals have become less common.  This suggests that soft corals are more resilient than stony corals to the wide diversity of disturbances that have been impacting coral corals. The best coral reefs on which to study these changes are those that have been studied for decades and can provide a decadal context to more recent events, and in this regard the reefs of St. John, US Virgin Islands are unique. Stony corals on the reefs have been studied since 1987, and the soft corals from 2014.  This provides unrivalled platform to evaluate patterns of octocoral abundance and recruitment; identify the patterns of change that are occurring on these reefs, and identify the processes responsible for the resilience of octocoral populations. The project will extend soft coral monitoring from 4 years to 8 years, and within this framework will examine the roles of baby corals, and their response to seafloor roughness, seawater flow, and seaweed, in determining the success of soft corals. The work will also assess whether the destructive effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria have modified the pattern of change. In concert with these efforts the project will be closely integrated with local high schools at which the investigators will host marine biology clubs and provide independent study opportunities for their students and teachers. Unique training opportunities will be provided to undergraduate and graduate students, as well as a postdoctoral researcher, all of whom will study and work in St. John, and the investigators will train coral reef researchers to identify the species of soft corals through a hands-on workshop to be conducted in the Florida Keys.<br/><br/>Understanding how changing environmental conditions will affect the community structure of major biomes is the ecological objective defining the 21st century.  The holistic effects of these conditions on coral reefs will be studied on shallow reefs within the Virgin Islands National Park in St. John, US Virgin Islands, which is the site of one of the longest-running, long-term studies of coral reef community dynamics in the region. With NSF-LTREB support, the investigators have been studying long-term changes in stony coral communities in this location since 1987, and in 2014 NSF-OCE support was used to build an octocoral ""overlay"" to this decadal perspective. The present project extends from this unique history, which has been punctuated by the effects of Hurricanes Irma and Maria, to place octocoral synecology in a decadal context, and the investigators exploit a rich suite of legacy data to better understand the present and immediate future of Caribbean coral reefs. This four-year project will advance on two concurrent fronts: first, to extend time-series analyses of octocoral communities from four to eight years to characterize the pattern and pace of change in community structure, and second, to conduct a program of hypothesis-driven experiments focused on octocoral settlement that will uncover the mechanisms allowing octocorals to more effectively colonize substrata than scleractinian corals on present day reefs.  Specifically, the investigators will conduct mensurative and manipulative experiments addressing four hypotheses focusing on the roles of: (1) habitat complexity in distinguishing between octocoral and scleractinian recruitment niches, (2) the recruitment niche in mediating post-settlement success, (3) competition in algal turf and macroalgae in determining the success of octocoral and scleractian recruits, and (4) role of octocoral canopies in modulating the flux of particles and larvae to the seafloor beneath. The results of this study will be integrated to evaluate the factors driving higher ecological resilience of octocorals versus scleractinians on present-day Caribbean reefs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Grapes (Vitis vinifera) are among the most important horticultural crops in the world, with over 1 million acres planted in the United States. Products of grape cultivation (table grapes, raisins, juice, wine and oil) have a value of $5.76 billion at the farm gate and an estimated $162 billion annually to the American economy. The viticulture industry has grown steadily over the past decade, but grape cultivation faces new and continuing challenges from diseases and abiotic stresses.  Grape cultivation relies heavily on wild North American species for rootstocks, and that reliance is expanding.  This project will allow researchers to determine the genetic composition of four wild grape species from the Southwest that are used, or have demonstrated promise, for grape breeding. The project will gather information about the ability of these species to resist Pierces Disease, it will generate new information about plant biology, genomics, and evolution, and it will make Vitis one of the best-studied botanical genera. Data obtained from this project will help worldwide grape breeding programs and will be available through a community resource, allowing the project investigators to share their research with members of the public and the wine and grape industries. They will also train and mentor undergraduate students, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars. The PIs work at public universities known for their efforts to broaden participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM fields and serving first generation college students.  <br/><br/>The cultivation, sustainability and security of grapes (Vitis vinifera) rely heavily on North American Vitis species as sources of resistance to abiotic and biotic stresses. This project aims to make Vitis a leading perennial model for comparative genomics, landscape genomics and association genomics. It will also further understanding of the basic biology of resistance to Pierces Disease, which is critical for the sustainability of viticulture. Researchers will assay hundreds of natural accessions to identify plants with resistance and study the geographic distribution of resistance in nature. They will complement phenotypic assays with whole genome resequencing (WGS) data to identify signatures of local adaptation, study the phylogenomics of the genus, and associate genetic variation with climatic variables. They will also employ analyses that aim to uncover important basic information about candidate genes and the genetic architecture underlying abiotic and biotic stress responses. An additional goal is to generate reference genomes for four North American Vitis species that have been used in rootstock breeding; currently, no reference genomes exist for any North American Vitis species. These genomes will be a valuable community resource, facilitate interspecific analyses, form the basis for inferring the pace and pattern of structural rearrangements during species diversification, and aid the identification of homologous and syntenous regions between V. vinifera and its congeners.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Waste treatment processes are directly tied to environmental and human health in both developed and developing countries but are subject to high costs due to significant energy and maintenance requirements. Municipal wastewater treatment alone accounts for about 3% of electrical energy consumed in the U.S and other developed countries. The successful implementation of the proposed technology, which integrates artificial intelligence (AI) into existing waste treatment infrastructure, has the potential to greatly improve the management of microbial communities associated with treatment processes thereby improving overall effectiveness and sustainability. This solution represents a new way for customers to cut energy and operational costs and improve effectiveness of their treatment processes without large investments in infrastructure. Potential markets for this technology include public, municipal facilities in addition to treatment facilities in the industrial/agricultural sector.  Development of the proposed technology will likely spur additional applications of AI systems in other fields centered around microbial community based engineered systems like bioproduct production, biosensing, and bioremediation.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on our recent development of a machine learning based approach used to accurately predict microbial community structure, process stability, and reactor performance for wastewater treatment. This novel approach, which incorporates genomic data along with environmental and operational parameters into data-mining datasets has demonstrated significant increases in accurately predicting process stability and performance of small-scale wastewater systems compared to models developed without consideration of microbial community dynamics. The predictive models developed through the construction of artificial neural networks have potential to inform engineering decisions for optimized performance and stability of environmental biotechnologies in full-scale systems. Development and implementation of this approach will not only progress the understanding and control of microbial communities that inhabit environmental biotechnologies but may be expanded to other microbiomes such as those associated with human health and biogeochemical cycles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this study, UMBC will collaborate with Baltimore City Public Schools (City Schools) to collect and document teacher classroom practices prior to the implementation of an extended professional development model that targets pedagogical skills associated with the Next Generation Science Standards. The broad objective of the project is to characterize the benefits and limitations of utilizing controlled practice-teaching as a key component of teacher professional development for integrating NGSS aligned practices in middle school science classrooms. Success will be measured by changes in teacher attitudes, enhancement of teacher pedagogical skills and student learning gains. Sixty teachers, and over 4,500 students in Baltimore City will be directly impacted through the professional development and curriculum enactment efforts proposed. As a full partner in the project, the City Schools' leadership will also learn what works, for whom, and under what conditions in schools that are representative of their diverse district. Lessons learned have the potential to inform the implementation of other new reform initiatives within City Schools and beyond. Findings from the proposed research have the potential to advance our understanding of innovative professional development strategies and their impact on classroom practices and student learning.<br/><br/>This project focuses on a national need of models for high quality professional development that directly tie specific strategies to classroom-based instructional changes and student learning outcomes. One particular shift in classroom practice that is fundamental for the classroom implementation of NGSS is scientific discourse and argumentation. One particular strategy that has shown promise for supporting teachers' use of strategies supporting argumentation is the use of controlled practice teaching. The proposed study explicitly attempts to determine the impact of the controlled practice-teaching using a quasi-experimental design. The research plan involves middle science teachers being assigned to one of two experimental conditions (PD including or excluding a controlled practice-teaching component) and then to investigate potential differences among the two treatments and control conditions related to changes in attitudes toward NGSS, classroom practices and impact on student learning. The researcher hypothesizes that the inclusion of control-practice teaching that is imbedded in a sustained professional development program will promote the development of teacher pedagogical skills aligned with NGSS more effectively than sustained professional development that does not include a control-practice component.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The zone of slip between the two plates is a geologic fault where the motion of the lower plate is imperfectly transferred to the overlying plate through frictional processes allowing for unreleased strain to build up in the upper plate.  The abrupt release of built-up strain in the upper plate causes earthquakes, which can be large on subduction zones because of the size of the slip region. These great earthquakes cause damage both from the shaking itself but also because of the flooding of seawater from a tsunami. Recent events in Sumatra in 2004, Chile in 2010, and Japan in 2011 all demonstrate the devastating hazard associated with these events.  Subduction zones also lie offshore the US coasts along Northern California, Oregon and Washington State and another along Alaska and the Aleutian Islands.   Both of these subduction zones have experienced great earthquakes in the past and will do so again in the future. A goal of this project is to better understand the geophysical processes at work at subduction zones and to improve the quantitative assessment of potential hazard. This project will deploy a combination of seafloor geodetic sensors to track the slow buildup and possible release of seafloor motion offshore of a New Zealand subduction zone.  The New Zealand Hikurangi site was picked because the subduction zone is shallow and can be imaged more effectively with seafloor geodetic instruments.  This site also has a history of rapidly repeating slow slip earthquakes that provide insight into the slip process.  Broader impacts of this project include training and support for a graduate student in the research. The project leverages international efforts by New Zealand and Japanese research teams who will occupy adjacent seafloor geodetic sites. The project will also transfer operational know-how for how to conduct seafloor geodesy experiments to NZ research counterparts, enabling them to collect measurements at these critical sites during this proposed project and continue in the future past the end of the project.<br/><br/>This project will measure deformation near the trench of the New Zealand Hikuangi subduction margin over a four year period using the GPS-Acoustic (GPS-A) method. The GPS-A site will be established in the Hawkes Bay area to provide critical measurements centered between GPS-A sites in the northern and southern parts of the margin established using Japanese and New Zealand funding. This central site is near the transition from an apparently strongly coupled margin to the South, and a nearly uncoupled margin in the North.  The project will implement the more efficient and cost-saving Wave Glider platform for the GPS-Acoustic measurements. Permanent seafloor benchmarks will be installed for horizontal positioning to ensure the time series of positions can be continued into the future, past the end of this project. An array of absolute pressure gauges will also be deployed for two years to measure the offshore extent of slow slip events observed from land arrays beneath the Hawkes Bay area, a region thought to have experienced many >8 magnitude earthquakes in the past based on paleoseismology. The array is expected to detect vertical uplift and hence the spatial extent of at least one large slow slip event in this region during the deployment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Typically, liquid-repellent surfaces are made with long chain fluorocarbon materials. However, long chain fluorocarbon materials are rapidly being phased out because of the growing concerns regarding their negative environmental and biological impacts. This research promotes national health by developing alternative surface treatments to the currently used toxic bio-accumulating materials. New hydro- and omniphobic materials are increasingly in demand for defense and commercial applications in textiles, surface coatings in harsh or ""dirty"" environments, among others. The work advances the science of surface repellents by providing the basic knowledge needed to design novel liquid-repellent surfaces with the more benign short chain fluorocarbon materials and with performance (i.e., degree of liquid repellency) equivalent to the long chain fluorocarbon materials. Such innovative liquid-repellent surfaces have the potential to drastically alter the non-stick coatings technology landscape in civilian, industrial and defense sectors. Therefore, the results and insights from this research will be significantly beneficial to the U.S. economy and society. The education activities are integrated with this research through the generation of STEM education kits and do-it-yourself (DIY) videos on ""Fun with Surface"" to be used in K-12 science classes in conjunction with teacher training workshops.<br/><br/>Liquid-repellent surfaces consisting of long chain fluorocarbons (i.e., linear molecules with 8 or more fully fluorinated carbons) decompose into perfluorooctanoic acid, which is bio-accumulative and is considered an emerging contaminant. So, it is essential to develop alternative sustainable materials (e.g., short chain fluorocarbons) that can be as liquid-repellent as long chain fluorocarbons. The research is based on the hypothesis that short chain fluorocarbons with high surface crystallinity and re-entrant morphology will offer liquid-repellency equivalent to long chain fluorocarbons. To test this hypothesis, the research team will systematically investigate the influence of molecular architecture of fluorocarbon surface ligands and surface modification reaction coordinates on surface crystallinity and morphology.

There is growing consensus that Thwaites Glacier is unstable and vulnerable to collapse. However, there is significant disagreement in projections of rates of mass loss, with some studies suggesting century to millennial scale retreat and others forecasting more catastrophic disintegration. These disagreements are significant because rapid disintegration of Thwaites and adjacent glaciers could potentially trigger or accelerate collapse of significant portions of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet with implications for global mean sea-level rise in the coming decades. Predicting rates of ice loss from Thwaites Glacier is currently hampered by a lack of reliable models of ice fracture and breakaway--called iceberg calving--and the interactions between calving and climate change. This study addresses this major knowledge gap, and is motivated by the need to improve sea-level projections critical for policy and planning. Moreover, there is also a gap between what scientists assert about the usefulness of sea-level rise predictions and stakeholder's perceptions of the usability of that work. This project is also geared to address this gap, by identifying the information that is accessible and usable to a broad community of stakeholders whilst proactively engaging with under-represented communities at nearby community colleges and school districts, engaging community college students in research.  <br/><br/>Projected rates of sea-level rise from the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (and Thwaites Glacier in particular) have large uncertainties due to difficulties in understanding and projecting the calving and dynamic processes that control the ice-sheet stability.  This uncertainty is magnified by the poorly understood connection between calving processes, ice-sheet stability and climate. To address these uncertainties, this project seeks to explicitly resolve the processes that could cause retreat and collapse of Thwaites Glacier using a novel ice-dynamics model suite.  This model suite includes a discrete element model capable of simulating coupled fracture and ice-flow processes, a 3D full Stokes continuum model, and the continental scale ice-dynamics model (BISICLES). Ice-dynamics models will be coupled to an ocean forcing model suite including simple plume models, intermediate complexity 2-layer ocean models and fully 3D regional ocean models. This hierarchical approach will use high-fidelity process models to inform and constrain the sequence of lower-order models needed to extrapolate improved understanding to larger scales and has the potential to radically reduce uncertainty of rates of marine ice-sheet collapse and associated sea-level rise. The large-scale modeling approach will be tested and implemented within the open source BISICLES ice dynamics model and made publicly available to other researchers via a ""calving package"".<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our product aims to improve early childhood STEM learning by supporting the preschool workforce. Children's development in math and science at the end of preschool predicts how well they will do in multiple subjects later in school. Our professional development tools will empower teachers to provide rich early STEM experiences so that all children, regardless of background, have the opportunity to be better students. These experiences also build habits of mind, inquiry, and interest in STEM, which can result in a stronger, larger, and more innovative STEM workforce. The business could develop a national footprint that employs educators and experts from across the country to provide professional development, online supports and resources, and innovative technology to educators, school districts, and other preschool education organizations. The reach and impact of the project could expand rapidly through emerging technologies. The business can fulfill a massive need in our society to improve early childhood education by providing quality professional development and support for those educating our youngest learners. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the commercial potential of our preschool professional development model and resources, SciMath-DLL. A variety of methods for program delivery, including direct to consumer, partnerships with schools, and outright licensing to schools could be utilized. Our model includes workshops, model lesson plans, professional learning communities, and individual reflective coaching across a range of STEM content. SciMath-DLL resulted from two DRK-12 early childhood STEM education research grants in which we developed the model and evaluated the positive changes in teachers, coaches, and children. In the first development project, results showed strong positive impacts on educators' confidence and teaching and coaching practice, and perceived improvements in children's skills and learning. Emerging findings from the second experimental study, show significant gains by the SciMath-DLL educators in terms of increased knowledge about STEM subjects and how to teach them to diverse student populations, and improved attitudes and beliefs about the ability of children to learn and apply STEM concepts. These results suggest that the SciMath-DLL program improves the quality of teaching, improves the quality of the help and guidance for teachers, and ultimately improves early childhood STEM education for children.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will have a direct impact on over 1000 Puerto Rican middle and high school students this school year. This research will contribute to a deeper understanding of the characteristics of educational interventions after a humanitarian crisis that can foster positive adaptation. Students will gain a scientific understanding of the natural disaster that occurred and of the resilience of the local El Yunque rainforest. In addition, these investigations will provide a positive outlet for students to express their feelings in creative ways and propose design solutions for their local community.<br/><br/>For school age children on the island of Puerto Rico, the back-to-back hurricane strikes of Irma and Maria were their first experience with the tragedy of hurricanes in Puerto Rico. There is much concern in the media and associated reader comments about the ability of the forests in Puerto Rico to recover. These concerns reveal common misconceptions about the dynamics of forest ecosystems. Long-term research conducted by Luquillo ecologists paints a different picture. The El Yunque rainforest has adapted to being struck by hurricanes on a regular basis. Engaging in investigations of El Yunque resilience at different timescales and different perspectives allows students to connect their learning about the rainforest to the current tragedy of their everyday life. Students will propose designs for their local community for rebuilding after Hurricane Maria and preparation for future hurricanes by mimicking how nature recovers from hurricanes. Researchers hypothesize that the quality of implementation will be predictive of the quality of students' projects, increased understanding of the dynamics of resilience in El Yunque, as well as increased appreciation for science.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs).

The stroma, which includes vascular cells, inflammatory/immune cells, and connective tissues, has emerged as an important determinant of tumor behavior. Therefore, a critical need exists for identifying the tumor promoting properties of the stroma. This project will use micro-scale engineering technology to construct a microfluidic model of the tumor stroma.  The model will include the cellular, extracellular matrix, and biomolecular constituents of the tumor stroma.   This novel model platform will be used to precisely examine the mechanisms by which the cellular components of the tumor stroma promote cancer progression.  The successful outcome of this research will remove technical barriers to studying the tumor microenvironment, and it will provide a deeper understanding of the role of tumor stroma in cancer.  The research program will be closely coupled with the PI's educational mission of increasing the pipeline of engineering students contributing to interdisciplinary cancer research by promoting awareness of the opportunities for engineering students towards this exciting academic career path at the interface of engineering and cancer. This project will support this vision through a combined education and outreach plan that is organized as a series of initiatives that start at the middle and high school level and proceed to the senior undergraduate level while also engaging the local community. Collectively, the outreach efforts will leverage the strong appeal that cancer research has as a top priority societal need with an emphasis on attracting, retaining, and promoting resilience of female students, who are underrepresented in engineering.<br/><br/>This project seeks to advance understanding of the physiochemical mechanisms by which stromal fibroblasts reprogram the tumor microenvironment (TME) through autocrine, paracrine, and pericellular matrix communication, with a particular focus on stroma activation that is controlled by different isoforms of the chemokine CXCL12 (or SDF-1), a signaling molecule that drives cancer metastasis in more than 23 different cancers.  An innovative approach, combining a) microscale engineering technologies that precisely model the stromal cell-endothelial cell interactions within the TME, b) quantitative microstructural analysis of the ECM, and c) molecular imaging probes that detect changes in the local biomolecular microenvironment, will be used to systematically investigate, with high degrees of fidelity and facile experimental control, the pathogenesis of an activated stroma microenvironment. The research aims are designed to test two hypotheses:  1)To quantify the effects on fibroblast activation that are CXCL12 isoform specific, using the microfluidic tumor stroma model combined with quantitative assessment of ECM remodeling, to test the hypothesis that alterations to ECM content and microstructure by stromal fibroblasts are important determinants in distinguishing the potencies of different CXCL12 isoforms and 2) To distinguish specific isoforms of CXCL12 on their angiogenesis and vascular permeability promoting properties, using the PI's angiogenesis-on-a-chip (AoC) platform, to test the hypothesis that the potency of different CXCL12 isoforms on angiogenesis and vascular permeability is determined by changes to the ECM content and microstructure.  The studies will be performed in the context of breast cancer, and mammary fibroblasts that selectively secrete three distinct CXCL12-isoforms will be used as the model for stromal fibroblasts.  Completion of these aims will result in a significant advancement of our quantitative understanding of reactive stroma responses mediated by CXCL12 regulatory circuits.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such research is important because all data collected in both biophysical and social environments results from a variety of processes, and a fundamental characteristic of many processes is the geographic scale at which they occur.  This project will focus on evaluating methods that capture the scale of spatial processes.  It will provide new insights into statistically sound ways for analyzing complex phenomena like weather, economic markets, and population dynamic that result from multiple interacting processes occurring across a spectrum of scales ranging from global (macro) to local (micro).  The project will provide new perspectives regarding statistical approaches to analyze the ways through which spatial processes exhibit heterogeneity over space.  It will facilitate more effective use of models that allow parameters to vary over space rather than more traditional global models that reflect a ""one size fits all"" mentality.  The project will help transform spatial statistical modeling from being focused on producing average results which are potentially very misleading to producing local results that will generate much more powerful insights into the processes operating across space throughout the world.  The investigators will develop a comprehensive, open-source software suite that will make multi-scale local statistical analysis available to researchers and practitioners.<br/><br/>Although techniques for investigating possible spatial variation in model parameters have a long history, the development and application of such models has become increasingly pervasive over the last two decades.  This project will focus on statistical models that estimate process heterogeneity directly from the data without pre-specified groups, typically providing estimates of a process at every location in a sample.  Examples of such local modeling frameworks include eigenvector spatial filter-based local regression, geographically weighted regression, and some kinds of Bayesian spatially varying coefficient models.  Multi-scale extensions to these approaches have been proposed that allow for an individual indicator of scale to be derived for each separate relationship within a model.  Such models are still in their infancy, however, and several issues, such as robust inference, substantive interpretation, sensitivity, and efficient computation, need to be addressed before they can reach their full potential. The investigators will develop multi-scale extensions for three distinct local modeling frameworks. These frameworks will be compared in terms of their inferential and predictive capabilities in order to assess the relative advantages and disadvantages of each.  The investigators will derive a standard definition of scale by assessing the meaning of indicators of scale from local models, and they will analyze the indicators in terms of their generalizability, interpretability, and robustness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This unparalleled fossil assemblage allows rigorous studies of extinct mammal biology, especially of carnivores which are rare at most fossil sites. The La Brea fossils span a critical time in Earth's history (approximately 50,000 years ago to the present) that includes major events such as the end of the last Ice Age, the arrival of humans in North America, and an extinction that killed two thirds of the large mammals on the continent. This unique deposit will be used to investigate relationships between major environmental changes and evolutionary variation (size, diet, etc.) in large mammals, information that is critical for promoting the survival of wildlife today. The project involves significant community outreach in the greater Los Angeles area through the Tar Pits Museum and will create educational content that will be available online for high school teachers across the country.<br/><br/>	The major impediment to system-level study at Rancho La Brea is a paucity of radiocarbon dates and the resulting inability to correlate biotic change with time. This project will intensively radiocarbon date samples from multiple pits spanning the last 50,000 years to establish the first detailed chronology for the entrapment of four extinct species of large mammals, and one extant species. It will involve the collection and compilation of census data for these species to track changes in total abundance and diversity, as well as data on morphological and dietary changes. A well-resolved chronology will allow these data on evolutionary changes in mammals and the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions to be linked to existing records of major paleo-environmental changes. This work will have broad implications for our understanding of extinctions, survival, environmental variables, and humans on mammalian ecology, which is directly relevant to modern conservation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

SMART aims to address the severe shortage of STEM teachers in the university's service area. While the region has an overwhelmingly large K-12 minority student population, very few teachers are from underrepresented populations. As such, it is critical to increase the number of teachers who share their students' cultural heritage. The overarching goal of this project is to prepare a diverse group of mathematics and science teachers who can serve as role models and leaders in high-need schools in the region. SMART will establish professional learning communities and provide participants with pedagogical training, mentoring, and ongoing teaching experiences in highly diverse educational settings. The project will engage participants in carefully structured training and field experiences to help them develop subject matter knowledge, understanding of linguistics, language acquisition, academic language acquisition, and subject-specific methods to make content accessible to all students. Other project activities will include monthly cohort meetings, a summer research experience, and tutoring opportunities. In collaboration with school district teacher induction programs, SMART will develop a New Teacher Retention Program. This program will be aimed at providing incoming teachers with guidance and holistic support needed to teach mathematics and science to diverse student populations. <br/><br/>Over a five-year period, SMART aims to increase the number of STEM credential candidates at CSU Stanislaus from 119 to 200. Half of these credential candidates will be students of minority backgrounds. SMART will recruit, prepare, and retain 31 Noyce scholars. Noyce scholars will include STEM majors from CSU Stanislaus and UC Merced, transfer students from nearby community colleges, and local career changers interested in entering the teaching profession. An energetic, capable, diverse community of STEM teachers has the potential to lower the educational barriers that minority and English Language Learner students often encounter when completing mathematics and science coursework. A significant percentage of CSU Stanislaus students are not only ethnically and linguistically diverse, but also are the first in their family to attend college. SMART will provide the educational community with a better understanding of the training and support systems needed to recruit and prepare students of minority background for a career as a teacher in a high-need school.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, such datasets are typically archived in inaccessible repositories and may be poorly described and difficult to use by others. Current manufacturing research must shift from siloed repositories of product manufacturing data to a federated, decentralized, open and inter-operable approach. This transformation can be achieved by embedding cyber-capability in every physical end-point, be it on a desktop used by a product designer or within the control systems of a manufacturing machine. The goal of this project is to develop a pilot manufacturing-focused cyberinfrastructure called FabWave. FabWave will gather together digital data on product and manufacturing processes from diverse sources, in particular, three-dimensional (3D) computer aided design (CAD) models generated by academia and public community users, into a new rich dataset that, in turn, will be fully accessible to manufacturing researchers and others. FabWave's system design will be driven by the needs of the manufacturing research community, and the project will encourage its adoption by academic users, government labs and the public. FabWave will aim to lower the barriers for users to upload, share and download 3D product model data; it will also enable manufacturing science researchers to gain access to an information rich dataset for testing and evaluation of algorithms to advance manufacturing research and offer the capability for the community to build custom apps that provide services to the community. This infrastructure development project aligns with the NSF Harnessing Data for 21st Century Science and Engineering Big Ideas vision and can serve to improve US competitiveness in advanced manufacturing.<br/><br/>The de novo cyberinfrastructure tools to be built in the FabWave project include: 1) Direct plugins within design software to allow easier capture of metadata and upload of 3D product models to the FabWave repository with limited human interaction; 2) a data-store with application programming interface (API) tools to allow users to write scripts to search through the repository for content specific to their research questions. Innovative use of the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) protocols along with next generation unstructured databases will serve to index and enable search services for Fabwave's users. the project will demonstrate use of FabWave for development of community facing third-party apps and libraries. Ultimately, the research community will have access to a rich source of product datasets created within research laboratories, within classes and through other open sourced projects. This data network, if expanded across universities, would accelerate advancements in cybermanufacturing, engineering systems design, and cyber-physical systems in manufacturing. In addition, FabWave will enable new areas of research in manufacturing information integration and informatics combined with reducing the barriers to exploring the science of manufacturing machine intelligence.

This project seeks to understand such noise generation when the gas in question (e.g., carbon dioxide, or high-temperature air) absorbs sound waves at certain frequencies. In particular, it is thought that by introducing such a gas into a near-surface flow of air, the noise generation can be reduced in configurations such as high-speed wind tunnels, where this noise can severely contaminate measurements. In conjunction, a variety of educational activities will be undertaken to introduce students at all levels to high-speed flows, including the creation of a YouTube channel where students can suggest objects to be flown in a Mach-8 wind tunnel.<br/><br/>A systematic experimental study will be conducted to investigate turbulence-generated noise in the presence of a vibrationally relaxing gas. Acoustic attenuation measurements will be performed in quiescent pure gases (e.g., CO2, N2O) and gas mixtures to identify strong acoustically absorbing combinations at pressures and temperatures relevant to high-speed flows; results will be compared with theoretical attenuation models. Experiments in supersonic and hypersonic wind tunnels will examine the acoustic noise generated by a high-speed turbulent boundary layer: first, with the species identified in the earlier quiescent experiments as test gases; and subsequently with these species introduced locally into the boundary layer of an air flow. Effects of nonequilibrium on surface-pressure and turbulent velocity fluctuations will also be determined.  This work will ultimately provide a fundamental understanding of thermal nonequilibrium effects on high-speed turbulence, as well as potentially provide a control mechanism for the reduction of acoustic noise in hypersonic wind tunnels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To maintain competitiveness in agriculture and prepare for future environmental challenges, such as drought or disease outbreaks, new technologies are needed to accelerate basic research in corn. Genetic transformation is an essential tool for fundamental biological studies.  It allows for a more complete analysis of gene function, enabling an increase in the knowledge base upon which advances in agriculture are made.  It is also a key step in generating biotech traits in crop plants to enhance and provide stability for food production. Despite years of effort, genetic transformation is still remarkably difficult to perform in corn. The current technology for production of transformed corn plants is limited by technical difficulties, high cost, and long turnaround time.  Consequently, genetic transformation is a bottleneck that slows basic research and agricultural advancement.   This project will develop a new method to deliver genes to immature seed on corn ears, combined with genetic color markers that visibly identify the successfully transformed seed. This will accelerate progress for many aspects of maize research.<br/> <br/>Part 2 Technical<br/>Using knowledge of maize reproductive development, a method is being developed to make transformation of maize accessible to all labs that are able to perform basic maize genetics and molecular biology.  Agrobacterium treatment of developing maize ears  will be tested for the ability to produce heritable transformation of maize kernels.  Two maize inbred varieties that are commonly used for genetic research will be tested as well as a mutant with reproductive abnormalities to identify the most robust and user-friendly method possible.  This simple, quick and efficient technique will enable individual labs to produce transgenic plants without the epigenetic abnormalities associated with tissue culture plantlet regeneration while also circumventing the need for highly specialized personnel or out-sourcing of transgenic line production to service facilities, which are limited in capacity.

Radiation shielding improvements in the nuclear industry could result in upwards of one billion dollars in savings annually and result in lower electricity costs.  Commercialization of these advanced materials can also minimize the effects of disasters like Fukushima and reduce the costs of clean-up efforts.  Lightweight radiation shielding materials are also needed in airplanes and satellites to protect workers and electronic systems from cosmic radiation and for medical personnel working with radiation related treatments. <br/> <br/>This I-Corps project is based on an innovative lightweight radiation shielding material that withstands operating temperatures nearly double those of commercially available products.  It has been demonstrated that the addition of carbon-based particles can more quickly move heat away from radioactive waste; this enables safer disposal options for the nuclear waste.  Additional technical merit lies in the fabrication process that has been developed to reduce the weight and size of the material.

This doctoral dissertation research improvement project investigates how changes in the knowledge economy influence these training and work dynamics. The extent of collaboration between faculty scientists and industry scientists has grown in recent decades. Together, academic and industry scientists have made breakthroughs that have improved human health, technology, and production processes. This project investigates how graduate student training in science and engineering is changing in response to these closer connections between academia and industry. Through understanding changes in the knowledge economy and how graduate student training supports knowledge production, this project addresses the need to integrate graduate students more effectively into the US science and engineering workforce. The project also has implications for broadening participation in science and engineering, as the results will bring out the ways female and male graduate students are recruited and retained in science and engineering fields.<br/><br/>This dissertation project employs two qualitative research methods: ethnography and interviews. The detailed ethnographic observations chart physical scientists' daily practices surrounding research, collaboration, and the training of students. Observations are conducted at a research center and with a training grant program. In addition, observations at professional scientific meetings will expand the scope for understanding the complex role students play in knowledge production. These data reveal how graduate students are trained to disseminate their scientific knowledge, and collaborate with colleagues in academic and industry settings outside of their own campus. Interviews with students, faculty, and research support personnel provide data on the experiences and perceptions that scientists have of wider changes in the knowledge economy, and of their own collaborations. Observations and interviews will be supplemented with content analysis of documents and written materials from each site and from professional scientific associations. This project aims to understand not only the dynamics of work and professionalization for students training to become scientists, but also to uncover student perceptions of broader changes in the knowledge economy. The research will generate new knowledge on how relationships between academic and industry science shape student work, training, and professional development. The findings from this dissertation project will inform policy discussions about the future development of the U.S. scientific workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This debate is motivated by the city's history of law enforcement policies and practices that disproportionately impact residents living in various neighborhoods. Nowhere is this geographic pattern more visible than in the practice of civil asset forfeiture between 2000 and 2015. This particular practice permits law enforcement agencies to seize assets from people suspected of crimes and to use those assets to fund further police work. In this manner, civil forfeiture is consistent with other criminal justice practices, such as cash bail, that may pose financial consequences even for those defendants who are not convicted of crimes. Noting that forfeiture has taken place almost exclusively in the city's poorest neighborhoods, this research, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, asks how police and prosecutorial agencies in Philadelphia make decisions about the seizure of cash and property. What criteria is used to determine whether or not an asset is forfeitable? What impact does this practice have on the everyday financial wellbeing of Philadelphians? The data collected through this research will be instructive to those debating new criminal justice policies. It will also advance new social scientific understandings of how the criminal justice system intersects with financial wellbeing in low-income communities.<br/> <br/>Jackson Smith, under the supervision of Dr. Michael Ralph of New York University, will explore the impact of civil asset forfeiture on criminal justice and policing in urban communities. Situating this research in Philadelphia is especially timely given the progress of criminal justice reform efforts there. It was widely used by the city between 2000 and 2015, and is not likely to continue under the leadership of the new district attorney. The city is also currently undertaking a multi-year initiative to reduce its incarcerated population, which had been the highest among the U.S.'s ten largest cities. Because of this, Philadelphia represents an ideal laboratory for testing the hypothesis that that civil asset forfeiture institutionalizes socioeconomic differences. This research will utilize a rich set of interdisciplinary methods, including ethnography, archival research, and GIS visualization, to chart the recent history of these criminal justice issues, geographically visualize the impacts of policing throughout the city, and appraise the early achievements of criminal justice reform. Research will include a systematic review of court records documenting the city's use of forfeiture prior to 2015, as well as interviews with stakeholders to illuminate the challenges and successes of recent reforms. This research will advance a more holistic and integrated understanding of the criminal justice system by focusing on how it shapes financial wellbeing. In doing so, it will also offer timely insight into proposals for criminal justice reform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will lay the foundation for data-driven transportation science that is to have an impact at all scales from individuals' quality of life to the nation's economy. This project will involve collaboration with several public agencies and private firms to develop, deploy and test real-world systems in the Pittsburgh metropolitan area based on large-scale data analytics. All models, algorithms, and examples will be implemented and open sourced in the public domain to promote access to applications and spark discussions from users all over the world. The results will be used to develop a new undergraduate course on data analytics for infrastructure management. Additionally, a virtual laboratory will be developed in conjunction with Carnegie Museum of Natural History for educating students in grades 7-12, college students, and the general public. Students from both Carnegie Mellon University and University of Pittsburgh will be engaged through learning sessions, data analytics competitions, and hands-on activities. <br/>   <br/>The goal of this CAREER project is to develop theories and algorithms that utilize large-scale data to infer characteristics of probabilistic network flow and optimally manage transportation networks under uncertainty. High-dimensional joint probability distributions are used to explicitly model probabilistic network flow and system states in the context of flow dynamics and user behavior.

Although tornadoes are known to produce some of the strongest winds on earth, sufficient understanding of the magnitude, frequency, and structure of these violent winds remains elusive. To effectively design structures that provide protection for life and property against tornadoes, it is necessary to better understand the wind speeds in tornadoes, the interaction of tornado winds with structures, and the likelihood of tornado occurrences.  At the small scale, this research will employ cutting-edge technologies, such as laser scanning and digital imaging, to create highly detailed, 3D digital models of tornado-damaged structures.  The research will also examine large-scale tornado phenomena by using earth-observing satellite images to help detect ""missing"" (unobserved) tornadoes. Improved characterization of regional tornado climates, wind structures, and wind speeds will improve tornado forecast models and risk-based design methodologies. Heightened understanding of tornado hazard will advance society's ability to plan for, and rapidly respond and recover from, disasters, thus promoting national welfare and prosperity. This project also will provide a platform to enhance STEM education in a large rural portion of West Texas by encouraging the pursuit of graduate education through engaging undergraduate students in research collaborations with U.S. and international research institutions and an expansive Natural Hazards Workshop/Symposium series that will bring researchers from academia, government, and industry to campus to inspire students to pursue research and innovation for challenging natural hazard mitigation problems.  Data from this project will be archived and shared in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) DesignSafe Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). <br/><br/>The objectives of this CAREER award are the achievement of rapid and comprehensive multi-scale wind damage assessments through remote sensing, advancement of understanding of tornado-structure interaction, and inspiration and training of students for vital roles in securing national welfare and prosperity through minimizing life and property losses from wind hazards. Through strategic research collaborations, the Principal Investigator and undergraduate student researchers will explore tornado actions via remote sensing technologies at multiple scales.  At small scales, reality-capture-enhanced modeling of tornado-induced failures of engineered steel structures will utilize 3D reality-capture platforms (photogrammetry and lidar) and optimization of these platforms to balance the breadth and depth of detailed forensic analyses of damaged structures (in collaboration with the Texas Tech University National Wind Institute). This modeling will then be used to investigate tornado impacts on structures through the measurement of deflections and study of failure patterns. At the large scale, the project will investigate a methodology to detect ""missing"" tornadoes via multi-spectral image analysis to enhance tornado climatology in sparsely populated and forested areas (in collaboration with Western University in Canada). The research will advance the knowledge of complex tornado-structure interactions, estimation of tornado intensity, and detection of tornado occurrences via safe, reliable, efficient, and cutting-edge remote sensing technologies at spatial scales ranging from minute structural deformations to the overall tornado-path level. The research will provide validation methods for physical and numerical tornado load simulations, facilitate necessary adjustments to wind speed estimates in the Enhanced Fujita Scale, and explore optimization of high-resolution imaging platforms to most effectively advance the understanding of tornado effects on the built environment. Detection of ""missing"" tornadoes will enhance climatology studies, providing a basis to improve forecasts, warnings, and risk models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern agriculture is based on the adoption of selection as a method to improve crops. Furthermore, dealing with emerging diseases and antibiotic resistance is helped by understanding how natural selection operates. This project examines the fact that the strength and direction of natural selection routinely differs between males and females of a species. The consequence of this selection depends on whether the same genes are expressed in males and females. The research team will explore selection on males and females using field studies, genomic analyses, and statistical modeling using Silene latifolia, an herbaceous flowering plant. This plant is an ideal model for this research given extensive prior work demonstrating important phenotypic and genetic differences between males and females. Workshops to the scientific community will be presented on how to write scientific articles and the genomic techniques used in this study. Outreach to the general public will include a project involving high-school students in Kansas in genetic research, and a demonstration on flowers at a community-level science festival in Indiana.<br/><br/>The research team will collect phenotypic and fitness measurements on all individuals within a S. latifolia population from Virginia, and then interrogate these individuals, and their progeny, at Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. The combination of phenotypic, genotypic, and fitness data will allow the researchers to determine if selection is evident at the scale of individual loci and if it differs between males and females. This species has heteromorphic sex chromosomes (males are XY), and a genome-wide characterization of selection will enable a test of the prediction that selection should differ between autosomes and sex chromosomes. While there is a great body of work measuring natural selection in plant populations, this experiment will provide unprecedented detail on a typically hidden component of selection, the differential success of male plants in siring. Finally, the project will allow both undergraduate and graduate students to engage in and learn field techniques, laboratory methodology, and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the evidence reported in expert-novice teacher literature suggesting that teachers become experts by gaining PCK through on-the-job learning, little is known about what and how teachers learn during their early career. This project addresses the fundamental issue of how and under what conditions beginning Grades 3 to 7 teachers of mathematics improve their PCK, what learning opportunities play a role in beginning teachers' PCK growth, and what the learning trajectories look like for beginning mathematics teachers. Although this project primarily focuses on teachers' PCK development in the areas of fractions and proportional reasoning, it has the potential to inform research on teachers' PCK development in other topic areas or disciplines. The work will contribute significantly to advancing our understanding of the learning opportunities that are key to beginning teachers' learning and knowledge development, and the results of this research will have the potential to guide the work of and interventions by researchers and teacher educators.

Additionally, the generalizability of key professional learning opportunities identified in the qualitative phase will be assessed using the larger sample. Outcomes from this research will be translated into educational activities and pedagogical resources that can be used by other researchers and teacher educators as a means of enhancing the PCK of elementary and middle school teachers of mathematics.

The wide adoption of SGX will foster a shielded execution paradigm for enhancing software security in situations where the operating systems are not entirely trusted, such as public clouds. However, recent studies have suggested that SGX is vulnerable to side-channel threats, in which the system software measures the enclaves' use of system resources or micro-architectural resources to infer their secrets. Such a threat will significantly imperil the potential positive impacts that SGX could bring to the society, such as protecting software intellectual property and securely distributing and processing secret data.<br/><br/>This research aims to address the side-channel hazards in SGX and advance the field in two aspects: First, it will develop novel principles and techniques to detect vulnerabilities in enclave programs, by modeling side-channel vulnerabilities and differentially analyzing their memory access patterns according to the model specification. Second, it will enhance enclave programs to thwart side-channel attacks at runtime by leveraging novel Timed Execution techniques and/or Address Space Layout Obfuscation mechanisms. The research will not only push forward the frontier of side-channel studies, but have broader societal impacts in the following aspects: First, because side-channels are major security concerns of security-critical applications to which shielded execution is the most valuable, the project will accelerate the broader acceptance of the shielded execution paradigm and the SGX technology. Second, through a set of educational tasks, the project will promote awareness of side-channel hazards to students, researchers, industry partners, and the general public, and hence motivate the adoption of the side-channel defense techniques in real-world applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Differential privacy is a formulation of statistical privacy that protects individual data values while still allowing the release of results from privacy-preserving analyses. Prior work on language-based techniques for differential privacy has focused on preventing leaks, rejecting programs either statically, before they run, or dynamically, as they run, before they leak too much information. This project uses an approach that allows the compiler and runtime to enforce privacy requirements by construction. The objective is two-fold: to make it easier for programmers to implement privacy-preserving data analytics, and to provide provable privacy guarantees. The approach facilitates the programming of differentially algorithms, while allowing non-experts to build up intuitions about what makes programs differentially private. The project integrates research with education by developing a framework to educate non-experts about statistical privacy, by disseminating results to both the academic community and collaborators, and incorporating the techniques into the security curriculum.<br/><br/>Central to the technical approach is the concept of policy-agnostic programming, where a programmer can write policy-enforcing code that looks similar to (simpler) policy-free code and relies on the runtime environment to customize program behavior to enforce policies. The project develops the theory and infrastructure for a new programming framework called Jostle that supports privacy-agnostic programming through exposing fine-grained algorithmic choices to the programmer. The compiler and runtime, rather than the programmer, is responsible for navigating the space of privacy and accuracy trade-offs. Making this work involves (1) a dynamic semantics for policy-agnostic differential privacy, (2) a decidable probabilistic relational type system, and (3) a compilation framework for policy-agnostic differential privacy that uses the results of (1) and (2) for statically and dynamically exploring privacy/accuracy tradeoffs. The resulting system supports implementations of complex machine learning algorithms that are agnostic to the differential privacy concerns, and allow the programmer to rely on the compiler and runtime to modify programs to satisfy privacy requirements. The approach is intended to be sufficiently general to support different formulations of statistical privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) could raise the global sea level by about 5 meters (16 feet) and the scientific community considers it the most significant risk for coastal environments and cities. The risk arises from the deep, marine setting of WAIS. Although scientists have been aware of the precarious setting of this ice sheet since the early 1970s, it is only now that the flow of ice in several large drainage basins is undergoing dynamic change consistent with a potentially irreversible disintegration. Understanding WAIS stability and enabling more accurate prediction of sea-level rise through computer simulation are two of the key objectives facing the polar science community today. This project will directly address both objectives by: (1) using state-of-the-art technologies to observe rapidly deforming parts of Thwaites Glacier that may have significant control over the future evolution of WAIS, and (2) using these new observations to improve ice-sheet models used to predict future sea-level rise. This project brings together a multidisciplinary team of UK and US scientists. This international collaboration will result in new understanding of natural processes that may lead to the collapse of the WAIS and will boost infrastructure for research and education by creating a multidisciplinary network of scientists. This team will mentor three postdoctoral researchers, train four Ph.D. students and integrate undergraduate students in this research project.<br/><br/>The project will test the overarching hypothesis that shear-margin dynamics may exert powerful control on the future evolution of ice flow in Thwaites Drainage Basin. To test the hypothesis, the team will set up an ice observatory at two sites on the eastern shear margin of Thwaites Glacier. The team argues that weak topographic control makes this shear margin susceptible to outward migration and, possibly, sudden jumps in response to the drawdown of inland ice when the grounding line of Thwaites retreats. The ice observatory is designed to produce new and comprehensive constraints on englacial properties, including ice deformation rates, ice crystal fabric, ice viscosity, ice temperature, ice water content and basal melt rates. The ice observatory will also establish basal conditions, including thickness and porosity of the till layer and the deeper marine sediments, if any. Furthermore, the team will develop new knowledge with an emphasis on physical processes, including direct assessment of the spatial and temporal scales on which these processes operate. Seismic surveys will be carried out in 2D and 3D using wireless geophones. A network of broadband seismometers will identify icequakes produced by crevassing and basal sliding. Autonomous radar systems with phased arrays will produce sequential images of rapidly deforming internal layers in 3D while potentially also revealing the geometry of a basal water system. Datasets will be incorporated into numerical models developed on different spatial scales. One will focus specifically on shear-margin dynamics, the other on how shear-margin dynamics can influence ice flow in the whole drainage basin. Upon completion, the project aims to have confirmed whether the eastern shear margin of Thwaites Glacier can migrate rapidly, as hypothesized, and if so what the impacts will be in terms of sea-level rise in this century and beyond.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project explores novel auto-scaling and multi-deformable convolutional network architectures that utilize parametric motion fields to automatically locate the correct deformations of a visual object for each convolutional filter. In order to learn the motion fields from video, the research team uses a Siamese convolutional-deconvolutional network predicting boundaries in two consecutive frames, and utilizes an output-to-output feedback loop to deduce boundary motion.  The research team applies this approach to video segmentation and uses it to generate annotations for a weakly supervised learning of the motion fields.

The education objective of this proposal is to advance the Environmental and Spatial Technology (EAST) initiative, which is a regionally important project-based, service learning program at middle and high schools. The PI will work with three EAST school programs to collect data useful to the research objectives and to generate a state map to model how changes in land cover can impact groundwater levels and greenhouse gas emissions.

Poor understanding of how roots respond to stress is an obstacle to understanding plant responses to environmental change. In addition, how quickly roots decompose affects how nutrients are recycled from dead root tissues, which can further influence plant growth. However, current models of root decomposition are based on what is known about the breakdown of aboveground parts of plants, like leaves and stems. Furthermore, little is known about how root chemistry varies with local soil conditions which limits understanding of how plants respond to nutrient poor soils, or how this in turn influences soil nutrient recycling. This research will study how soil conditions and microbes influence root chemistry of important forest tree species in eastern North America. Results of this research will also improve models of root decomposition by incorporating root chemical composition. This project will also provide several benefits to society. It will create workshops for high school students and a summer course and curriculum development materials for K-12 teachers. It will also provide training for undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher.<br/><br/>Fine roots (less than 2mm diameter) have a disproportionately large influence on plant adaptation and key ecosystem processes, yet they remain one of the least understood components of Terrestrial Biosphere Models. Commonly used parameters, such as element ratios, that predict decomposition of aboveground tissues fail to adequately predict the decomposition of fine roots. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that this disconnect is due to the unique chemical construction of roots, which is shaped by their immediate biotic and abiotic soil environments. The PIs propose to investigate the chemical plasticity in fine roots of different tree species developed under different soil resource availabilities and associations with different species of mycorrhizal fungi. The PIs will link observed chemical plasticity to decomposition dynamics of fine roots using decomposition experiments and by utilizing advanced imaging and spectroscopy techniques. The PIs propose to develop parameters that incorporate root chemistry to improve predictions of fine-root decomposition. The proposed project would be one of the first attempts to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular-level chemical profile of fine-roots that facilitate plant stress adaptation, and to develop robust parameters to predict fine-root decomposition and soil organic matter formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To be effective in such settings, robots need to manipulate many kinds of deformable objects, such as cloth, string or wires, and plant or animal tissue.  Giving robots the ability to manipulate such objects has the potential to revolutionize the use of robots in several application domains: In manufacturing, allowing robots to pack boxes and handle food and fabric; in medicine, allowing robots to perform tedious tasks in surgery and make hospital beds; and in service, allowing robots to handle clothes and prepare food. However, such tasks are beyond the current state-of-the-art, largely because deformable objects are difficult to model and control.  This project will develop new theory, validated with extensive experimentation, that aims to model deformable objects in ways that are amenable to both planning and control. This project will also use manipulation of deformable objects as a motivating problem for students studying robotics at the undergraduate and graduate levels, and in K-12 outreach.<br/><br/>This project investigates the fundamentals of modeling, control, and motion planning for deformable objects. This problem is challenging because deformable objects have large state spaces, are extremely-underactuated, and motion planning for these objects requires numerical simulation, which can be computationally expensive and inaccurate. The main hypothesis of this project is that these challenges can be overcome by representing the object and task in terms of distance constraints, which represent allowable distances between parts of the deformable object as well as between the object and parts of the environment, and formulating control and planning methods based on this representation. The expected outcome of this research is an enhanced ability of robots to perform useful tasks, based on a better understanding of deformable object manipulation and a set of broadly-applicable experimentally-verified controllers, planning building-blocks, and planning algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Satellite observations extending over the last 25 years show that Thwaites Glacier is rapidly thinning and accelerating. Over this same period, the Thwaites grounding line, the point at which the glacier transitions from sitting on the seabed to floating, has retreated. Oceanographic studies demonstrate that the main driver of these changes is incursion of warm water from the deep ocean that flows beneath the floating ice shelf and causes basal melting. The period of satellite observation is not long enough to determine how a large glacier, such as Thwaites, responds to long-term and near-term changes in the ocean or the atmosphere. As a result, records of glacier change from the pre-satellite era are required to build a holistic understanding of glacier behavior. Ocean-floor sediments deposited at the retreating grounding line and further offshore contain these longer-term records of changes in the glacier and the adjacent ocean. An additional large unknown is the topography of the seafloor and how it influences interactions of landward-flowing warm water with Thwaites Glacier and affects its stability. Consequently, this project focuses on the seafloor offshore from Thwaites Glacier and the records of past glacial and ocean change contained in the sediments deposited by the glacier and surrounding ocean.<br/><br/>Uncertainty in model projections of the future of Thwaites Glacier will be significantly reduced by cross-disciplinary investigations seaward of the current grounding line, including extracting the record of decadal to millennial variations in warm water incursion, determining the pre-satellite era history of grounding-line migration, and constraining the bathymetric pathways that control flow of warm water to the grounding line. Sedimentary records and glacial landforms preserved on the seafloor will allow reconstruction of changes in drivers and the glacial response to them over a range of timescales, thus providing reference data that can be used to initiate and evaluate the reliability of models. Such data will further provide insights on the influence of poorly understood processes on marine ice sheet dynamics. This project will include an integrated suite of marine and sub-ice shelf research activities aimed at establishing boundary conditions seaward of the Thwaites Glacier grounding line, obtaining records of the external drivers of change, improving knowledge of processes leading to collapse of Thwaites Glacier, and determining the history of past change in grounding line migration and conditions at the glacier base. These objectives will be achieved through high-resolution geophysical surveys of the seafloor and analysis of sediments collected in cores from the inner shelf seaward of the Thwaites Glacier grounding line using ship-based equipment, and from beneath the ice shelf using a corer deployed through the ice shelf via hot water drill holes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since the 1980s, within a relatively static framework set by the two other branches of government, courts' rulings on legal disputes have continuously changed the strength of patents in the US. Meanwhile, there is still controversy regarding the impact of the strength of patents on innovation. The debate has been stymied by difficulties in understanding the effect of various facets of patent policy. This project offers a solution to advance our understanding of how courts shape the patent system by (1) distinguishing three aspects of strength in the analysis: patentability, breadth and ability to exclude and (2) examining the heterogeneous impact of these court decisions on the rate and direction of firms' innovative activities. The research answers the following three questions. First, what influences decision-making for patent-related Supreme Court decisions? Second, do firms react to decisions in the direction expected by the Court? Lastly, do firms benefit from participating in policymaking? As a result, the project also provides new insights on the policymaking process by the courts, focusing on the constraints and external influences in decision-making, including firms' incentives to advocate for their position. In addition, this project provides an understanding of the aggregated effect of apparently disjointed cases on the overall rate and direction of innovation. <br/><br/>The first part examines the policymaking process in the court based on all US Supreme Court patent cases over the period 2000-2015 to provide an understanding of the effect of participation of stakeholders (as party in a case, amici or through lobbying) on the decisions that change patent strength. The second part provides theoretical and empirical insights on the long-debated relationship between patent strength and innovation. It challenges the view that weaker patents lead to fewer innovations. To confront theories in the existing literature predicting changes in firm strategy leading to both increases and decreases in innovation, mixed methodology is used by combining the analysis of court documents with quantitative estimations of the impact using a panel data set of patent and firm data to examine the mechanisms behind patent policymaking and firm strategy. Lastly, the third part examines whether firms participating in patent policymaking obtain benefits reflected in their performance. For all three parts of the project, strong empirical evidence is provided regarding the mechanisms behind patent policymaking and firm strategy. An original research design is used to estimate the impact of a patent policy change on firms' behavior while controlling for competing explanations for the effects. The project also relies on unique data, an exhaustive panel data set matching patents with time series firm-level data on the entire population of French firms, based on unique identifiers, over the period of 1995-2014. Such data allow novel insights by distinguishing impacts on propensity to use patents from intensity of engagement in innovative activities and identifying population level evidence on firm formation and first-time involvement in innovative activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Large-scale growth of single crystals typically requires conducting crystallization under conditions at which the nucleation rate is slow enough to prevent the formation of polycrystalline particles. This process is time consuming and expensive. The proposed research is aimed at using advanced computational techniques to study the use of engineered surfaces, called crystal nucleating agents (CNAs), for accelerating the nucleation and growth of single crystals. The proposed studies aim to develop fundamental theories that can be used for optimizing crystal growth of a variety of materials.<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to develop a fundamental understanding of the effects of nanoscale patterning of a CNA surface on crystal nucleation and to identify operating conditions leading to reduced sensitivity of the nucleation rate to changes in process variables over a wide range of operating conditions within the nucleation-limited regime. This previously unknown deviation from the classical picture of heterogeneous nucleation is interesting to explore and understand from a theoretical perspective. The proposed research will computationally explore how different features of a nano-patterned CNA surface affect the sensitivity of nucleation rate to temperature and concentration in the nucleation-limited regime, and use that knowledge to design optimal CNA surfaces that offer the smallest sensitivity of rate to operating conditions at specific nucleation rates. The insights obtained from such theoretical and computational investigations can result in design rules that can guide experimental efforts to design operationally robust CNA materials. Integration of research and education will be focused towards developing a new course on Computational Materials Science for graduate and undergraduate students. Outreach efforts will involve public presentations and programming workshops targeting underrepresented minority students to motivate them to pursue career paths in STEM fields. The proposed project also involves the development of an advanced sampling software package that will be publicly shared with researchers that study rare events in a wide variety of physical, chemical and biological systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern agriculture is based on the adoption of selection as a method to improve crops. Furthermore, dealing with emerging diseases and antibiotic resistance is helped by understanding how natural selection operates. This project examines the fact that the strength and direction of natural selection routinely differs between males and females of a species. The consequence of this selection depends on whether the same genes are expressed in males and females. The research team will explore selection on males and females using field studies, genomic analyses, and statistical modeling using Silene latifolia, an herbaceous flowering plant. This plant is an ideal model for this research given extensive prior work demonstrating important phenotypic and genetic differences between males and females. Workshops to the scientific community will be presented on how to write scientific articles and the genomic techniques used in this study. Outreach to the general public will include a project involving high-school students in Kansas in genetic research, and a demonstration on flowers at a community-level science festival in Indiana.<br/><br/>The research team will collect phenotypic and fitness measurements on all individuals within a S. latifolia population from Virginia, and then interrogate these individuals, and their progeny, at Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) across the genome. The combination of phenotypic, genotypic, and fitness data will allow the researchers to determine if selection is evident at the scale of individual loci and if it differs between males and females. This species has heteromorphic sex chromosomes (males are XY), and a genome-wide characterization of selection will enable a test of the prediction that selection should differ between autosomes and sex chromosomes. While there is a great body of work measuring natural selection in plant populations, this experiment will provide unprecedented detail on a typically hidden component of selection, the differential success of male plants in siring. Finally, the project will allow both undergraduate and graduate students to engage in and learn field techniques, laboratory methodology, and bioinformatics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As wireless technologies become increasingly sophisticated, resource optimization problems also become more complex.  For example, a major technical challenge in the design of current and future cellular networks is to solve scheduling problems involving a large number of resource units in spectral and temporal domains.  Although some schedulers have been proposed to achieve optimal (or near-optimal) objectives, they typically cannot be used in the field due to excessive computation time.  Instead, operators have to adopt simple schedulers and settle for performance far from optimal.  This goal of this EAGER project is to tackle this fundamental problem by exploring a novel approach that could make real-time resource optimization possible.  By real time, we mean that a solution to the resource optimization problem can be found in a time resolution that can be readily used in the field. Our approach is to decompose a complex resource optimization problem into a large number of extremely simple subproblems that can be matched precisely into a given Graphical Processing Unit (GPU) computing platform.  By solving each small subproblem independently and all the sub-problems in parallel, it is possible to meet the stringent timing requirement for real-time scheduling. The proposed idea, if successful, has the potential to revolutionize how resource optimization is performed in the field.  The proposed research activities will have a profound impact on developing new educational curricula and broadening participation in computing from underrepresented groups.  New teaching materials will be developed from this research and will be used in classrooms at Virginia Tech and other universities.  Special efforts to broaden participation in computing by female and underrepresented students will be made through our Wireless@VT education and research programs.  Finally, the two investigators will continue their efforts to support N2 Women events at a networking conference to nurture female junior researchers to become leaders in the networking community.    <br/><br/>Some major technical challenges must be carefully addressed before we can reap the benefits of our proposed idea.  In this project, the investigators plan to explore the following two thrust areas as proof-of-concept: (i) how to optimally decompose and map a resource optimization problem into a given state-of-the-art GPU platform so that the solution can be obtained in real time; (ii) how to apply the methodology for real-time optimal scheduling for next generation cellular networks as well as other (non-cellular) wireless networks. The proposed approach is interdisciplinary and involves exploring new methods and tools from the fields of computing (GPU) and optimization (decomposition) to address fundamental problems in wireless networks.  Validation of the proposed ideas will be carried out on off-the-shelf low-cost GPU platform.  Once the proposed idea is proven to be valid, we expect to see a new and practical methodology to achieve real-time resource optimization and significant performance improvement in the real world.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From fish to frogs to humans, all of the ~60,000 vertebrate species on earth use sophisticated immune cells to ""inspect"" every other cell in their body to determine if it is friend or foe. These immune cells possess a large number of protein receptors on their surface that work to maintain the peace. Many of these receptors are designed to recognize specific types of pathogens, forming a front line of defense. However, pathogens typically reproduce quickly, allowing them to evolve or change faster than most vertebrates and thereby develop ways to escape detection. In response, vertebrates have evolved a complex immune system that includes large groups of receptors that evolve faster than most other proteins and are specialized for anticipated as well as unanticipated pathogens. Fish represent half of all vertebrates and, as a group, are a great model for studying the genetic basis of these defenses. This project will use new and existing genomic data from numerous fish species to determine the origins of these receptors and study how these receptors have evolved to achieve the diversity observed today. Using fish as a model, this work will reveal fundamental aspects of immunity in all vertebrates. Data collected from this project will be incorporated into multiple new exhibits at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences.<br/><br/>Ray-finned fish (Actinopterygii) constitute over half of the extant vertebrates on earth, making them a powerful system for understanding the genetic and functional evolution of immune genes. Fish not only share certain immune gene families with mammals, but also encode a number of highly diverse ""fish-specific"" immune gene families. Understanding the factors that underlie the diversification of gene families involved in immunity is critical for explaining the origins and sub-/neo-functionalization of new genes and for understanding the molecular basis of pathogen recognition and resistance. In order to provide an in-depth understanding of the origins of vertebrate immune gene families and their diversification dynamics, this project will integrate a phylogenetic comparative framework with new and existing transcriptome and genomic sequence data from multiple ray-finned fish lineages to determine how genomic architecture impacts the rate and mechanism of gene family evolution. This project will also evaluate the interdependence between genetically encoded markers of self and their candidate receptors. In total, this project will illuminate the evolution of recognition mechanisms that delineate self from non-self in all ray-finned fish, and reveal novel insight into both conserved and divergent means of accomplishing this critical immune function. Finally, this project will enable the creation of media content and interactive exhibits at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences including a virtual reality and augmented reality video-game that teaches visitors fundamental aspects of how immune systems function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This unparalleled fossil assemblage allows rigorous studies of extinct mammal biology, especially of carnivores which are rare at most fossil sites. The La Brea fossils span a critical time in Earth's history (approximately 50,000 years ago to the present) that includes major events such as the end of the last Ice Age, the arrival of humans in North America, and an extinction that killed two thirds of the large mammals on the continent. This unique deposit will be used to investigate relationships between major environmental changes and evolutionary variation (size, diet, etc.) in large mammals, information that is critical for promoting the survival of wildlife today. The project involves significant community outreach in the greater Los Angeles area through the Tar Pits Museum and will create educational content that will be available online for high school teachers across the country.<br/><br/>	The major impediment to system-level study at Rancho La Brea is a paucity of radiocarbon dates and the resulting inability to correlate biotic change with time. This project will intensively radiocarbon date samples from multiple pits spanning the last 50,000 years to establish the first detailed chronology for the entrapment of four extinct species of large mammals, and one extant species. It will involve the collection and compilation of census data for these species to track changes in total abundance and diversity, as well as data on morphological and dietary changes. A well-resolved chronology will allow these data on evolutionary changes in mammals and the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions to be linked to existing records of major paleo-environmental changes.

This project examines the influence of the tension between the need for care and encouragement of autonomy on the adult lives of people with ID/DD. More specifically, this study investigates disabled adulthood as a collection of care arrangements--created by significant others, programs, and government support--that shapes the opportunities for autonomy. This research has three goals: to assess the design of a novel independent living program for high functioning adults with ID/DD, to contribute to the literature on the ethics of care, and to situate the regulations governing state and federal funding for disability in the context of the daily life of adults with ID/DD.  Findings from this study have the potential for broader impacts through influence on government policy concerning care and directly on caregiving for adults with ID/DD.<br/><br/>This project will use ethnographic research, interviews, and qualitative analysis of government regulations and assessment tools to investigate disabled adulthood as a set of arrangements balancing care and autonomy. On the micro level, this study will describe the process of negotiating the relationship between care and autonomy for adults, family members, and staff at an independent living program. On the program level, this study will assess the program design and operation of a novel type of independent living program, one that provides as-needed care to individuals with ID/DD who live in their own apartments. On the institutional level, this study will investigate the influence of government regulations for entitlement programs like Medicaid, SSI/SSDI, and food stamps on the adult lives of people with ID/DD, including their ability to make autonomous decisions and to engage in adult behaviors like employment, marriage, and the activities of daily life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our lack of understanding of clouds, particularly those that are mixed in phase, limits our ability to understand precipitation, the atmosphere chemistry and climate. This project will determine the particles on which the droplets and ice crystals in mixed phase clouds form by deploying a new inlet and both warm and cold cloud chambers at Storm Peak Laboratory. Storm Peak is a high altitude site located in the Rocky Mountains in north-central Colorado that is among only a handful of sites worldwide that offers scientific laboratories where mixed phase clouds exist for long time periods. Using this new inlet, the research team will carry out two-season long observational studies of droplet and ice crystals within mixed phase clouds.

More information about the conference is available online at http://www.humancomputation.com/2018/.  The Doctoral Consortium will be a research-focused full-day meeting immediately following the conference technical program on July 8.  It will enhance the scientific workforce in this emerging research area by nurturing a group of promising young investigators interested in human computation and crowdsourcing, allowing them: to attend the conference; to learn of potential career paths within academia and industry; to access an international network of researchers who can support their professional development; and to see firsthand the interdisciplinary nature, diversity and interrelationships of research in human computation.  The faculty mentors also will serve as the review committee for student applications. The organizers will promote diversity by selecting no more than one or two students from any one school, and by prioritizing the selection of women and underrepresented minorities.  <br/><br/>The full-day Doctoral Consortium will include activities to guide the research of these promising young researchers. The Consortium will allow participants to interact with established researchers and with other students, through presentations, question-answer sessions, panel discussions, and invited presentations. Each participant will give a short presentation on their research and will receive feedback from at least one faculty mentor and from fellow students. The feedback will be geared toward helping the student participants understand and articulate how their research is positioned relative to other work on human computation and crowdsourcing.  Activities led by the faculty will include a panel discussion to give students more information about the process and lessons of research and life in academia and industry. To further integrate the Doctoral Consortium participants into the conference itself, students will have a chance to present their work in an interactive poster session, and their papers will be posted online on the workshop webpage.

The award to Spelman College has potential broader impact in a number of areas and will assist in building its research capacity and enhance the educational and research experiences of underrepresented students.  This study seeks to understand beta-cell death, a process that has been suggested to occur partially as a result of an increase in amylin, a protein that is co-secreted from beta-cells. A broader understanding of the role of amylin and UCP2 will contribute to understanding how cells communicate so that they can maintain a healthy cell status.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to clarify the role of Uncoupling Protein 2 (UCP2) in beta-cells, which are cells known for secreting insulin. Although the secretion of amylin is not often discussed when describing beta-cells, amylin has been shown to be co-secreted with insulin. The role of amylin in negatively impacting beta-cell function has recently been described. UCP2 is known for decreasing the number of oxygen radicals resulting from a metabolic process, which suggests that UCP2 may work to keep beta-cells healthy since a high number of oxygen radicals can lead to poor cell function. This project will investigate the influence of UCP2 on amylin's function, thereby affecting the role that amylin plays in beta-cells. In addition, the project examines the influence of UCP2 on amylin in neuronal cells, which are cells that have also been shown to have increased levels of amylin.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process improvement that will be facilitated by sensor technology will reduce manufacturing time and cost by 20-40%, improve part quality consistency, and improve molding productivity by 100%. Each percentage point improvement in productivity corresponds to cost savings in excess of more than $1 billion per year in the United States alone while reducing the energy consumption and environmental waste related to molding, discarding, and/or recycling of defective plastic parts.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will enable the team to determine the ideal parameters of a multivariate shrinkage sensor for industrial polymer manufacturing.  The insights gained from at least one hundred customer interviews will drive decisions on the commercial potential of a new multi-mode shrinkage monitoring sensor that will obviate the need for manual inspections and enable fully automatic production by directly measuring molded products as they are made, before the mold opens, so that defectives parts can be automatically diagnoses and recycled.  Through I-Corps, the team will assess current sensor design, its relative value compared to existing sensors and inspection procedures in the polymer manufacturing industry, and facilitate identification of customer segments with a critical unmet need for in-mold shrinkage sensor capability. Further, key learning from the I-Corps process will drive refinement of sensor development with the goal of developing a more commercially relevant sensor and provide industrial connections for sensor testing in the future.

Poor understanding of how roots respond to stress is an obstacle to understanding plant responses to environmental change. In addition, how quickly roots decompose affects how nutrients are recycled from dead root tissues, which can further influence plant growth. However, current models of root decomposition are based on what is known about the breakdown of aboveground parts of plants, like leaves and stems. Furthermore, little is known about how root chemistry varies with local soil conditions which limits understanding of how plants respond to nutrient poor soils, or how this in turn influences soil nutrient recycling. This research will study how soil conditions and microbes influence root chemistry of important forest tree species in eastern North America. Results of this research will also improve models of root decomposition by incorporating root chemical composition. This project will also provide several benefits to society. It will create workshops for high school students and a summer course and curriculum development materials for K-12 teachers. It will also provide training for undergraduates, graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher.<br/><br/>Fine roots (less than 2mm diameter) have a disproportionately large influence on plant adaptation and key ecosystem processes, yet they remain one of the least understood components of Terrestrial Biosphere Models. Commonly used parameters, such as element ratios, that predict decomposition of aboveground tissues fail to adequately predict the decomposition of fine roots. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that this disconnect is due to the unique chemical construction of roots, which is shaped by their immediate biotic and abiotic soil environments. The PIs propose to investigate the chemical plasticity in fine roots of different tree species developed under different soil resource availabilities and associations with different species of mycorrhizal fungi. The PIs will link observed chemical plasticity to decomposition dynamics of fine roots using decomposition experiments and by utilizing advanced imaging and spectroscopy techniques. The PIs propose to develop parameters that incorporate root chemistry to improve predictions of fine-root decomposition. The proposed project would be one of the first attempts to obtain a comprehensive understanding of the molecular-level chemical profile of fine-roots that facilitate plant stress adaptation, and to develop robust parameters to predict fine-root decomposition and soil organic matter formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These inhabitants were long invisible to scientists studying plants, but with the advancement of DNA-based assessment tools, researchers have discovered an increasing diversity of organisms that reside inside healthy plants. Endophytes include hundreds of microbial species (bacteria and fungi) that live in healthy wood inside standing trees. Some provide benefits to the host tree, but others, particularly fungi, may attack and/or weaken trees (pathogens) or may try to get a head start decomposing wood (saprotrophs). In addition, there are many microbes present as endophytes with functions that have yet to be determined. Determining these functions is a critical need for predicting the risk of tree hazards, and for modeling rates of decomposition and carbon released once a tree dies. Accurately predicting wood decay is difficult and presents a significant uncertainty in carbon cycle models. To improve predictive power, it is necessary to model a key transition that occurs when a tree dies a natural death, killing many endophytes but exposing a payoff to others that rise to dominate these subsequent microbial communities, particularly saprotrophs. This research makes use of a natural disturbance event, the great deal of tree damage created by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, to study how endophytes shape the fungal decomposition communities that develop post-disturbance. With this knowledge, it is possible not only to improve decomposition models but also better predict endophyte success, an asset for predicting tree hazard risks in future hurricanes. The project also offers opportunities for STEM training of several female team members, including Puerto Rican collaborators affected by Hurricane Maria. It will also lead to production of a public video describing the science, the scientists, and the role of endophytes in tree hazards and decomposition processes in nature.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to track the development of tree endophyte fungi post-hurricane in Puerto Rico's Guanica Forest scientific area, and to correlate this process with environmental variables and wood traits (e.g. nitrogen content). There are three specific objectives to reach this goal, 1) rapid-response sampling to assess fungal communities present at time zero, 2) tracking communities at two additional time points to assess persistence of endophytes, and 3) matching outcomes over one year to site climate data (temperature, rainfall) and to wood substrate physiochemistry. This study includes wood sections from 14 tree species, either cut and left in ground contact to decay along a transect or remaining standing as a stump section. A key hypothesis is that endophyte saprotrophs will have a greater influence on decomposition in standing sections rather than in ground contact, but that the overall rates of decomposition will be influenced by climate and wood physiochemical variables, particularly wood nitrogen and heartwood content. The study design allows coupling of community structure and function with host traits over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thwaites Glacier has been accelerating and widening over the past three decades. How fast Thwaites will disintegrate or how quickly it will find a new stable state have become some of the most important questions of the future of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet and its contribution to sea-level rise over the next decades to centuries and beyond.  This project will rely on three independent numerical models of ice flow, coupled to an ocean circulation model to (1) improve our understanding of the interactions between the ice and the underlying bedrock, (2) analyze how sensitive the glacier is to external changes, (3) assess the processes that may lead to a collapse of Thwaites, and, most importantly, (4) forecast future ice loss of Thwaites. By providing predictions based on a suite of coupled ice-ocean models, this project will also assess the uncertainty in model projections.<br/><br/>The project will use three independent ice-sheet models: Ice Sheet System Model, Ua, and STREAMICE, coupled to the ocean circulation model of the MIT General Circulation Model. The team will first focus on the representation of key physical processes of calving, ice damage, and basal slipperiness that have either not been included, or are poorly represented, in previous ice-flow modelling work. The team will then quantify the relative role of different proposed external drivers of change (e.g., ocean-induced ice-shelf thinning, loss of ice-shelf pinning points) and explore the stability regime of Thwaites Glacier with the aim of identifying internal thresholds separating stable and unstable grounding-line retreat.  Using inverse methodology, the project will produce new physically consistent high-resolution (300-m) data sets on ice-thicknesses from available radar measurements.  Furthermore, the team will generate new remote sensing data sets on ice velocities and rates of elevation change. These will be used to constrain and validate the numerical models, and will also be valuable stand-alone data sets. This process will allow the numerical models to be constrained more tightly by data than has previously been possible.  The resultant more robust model predictions of near-future impact of Thwaites Glacier on global sea levels can inform policy-relevant decision-making.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More than 30% (or 120,000) of these unique specimens are housed in two herbaria at the New Mexico State University (NMSU), one of which is the State's oldest herbarium. Together the NMSU herbaria represent the premier plant reference resource for the southern half of New Mexico, adjacent states, and northern Mexico. The goals of the project are to consolidate the NMSU herbaria, modernize their collections data management infrastructure, and update their management procedures, ultimately preserving the collections long-term, while broadening the data accessibility for education, research, and public use. With a multidisciplinary team of botanical researchers and local science educators, a series of academic and outreach initiatives will be implemented to increase literacy in the plant sciences within different sectors of the population. At NMSU, an official Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI), researchers will pursue the recruitment and engagement of students, using hands-on experiences aimed at the care, protection and use of herbarium specimens and their associated data. Skills learned will improve participation in further education and training opportunities (e.g., graduate school) in STEM fields, while increasing downstream employment prospects. Through partnership with a local scientific education non-profit organization, the project will develop comprehensive botanical outreach materials to increase awareness and interest in natural history collections, plant biology and biodiversity, and biogeography among at least 1,500 K-12 students in an underserved Hispanic region located in southern New Mexico.<br/><br/>Activities and expected outcomes include: 1) physical preservation, curation, and integration of herbarium specimens into a unified online digital herbarium (e.g., all specimens databased, barcoded, and imaged), 2) update of currently insecure, disparate databases of the herbaria into a single modern natural history collection management system, 3) acquisition of specimen data from a backlog of important uncurated specimens, 4) development of comprehensive botanical outreach and educational kits for local K-12 students, 5) training of undergraduate research assistants, and 6) implementation of professional workshops, and a crowdsourcing online campaign, all specifically tailored to a wide variety of stakeholders (e.g., students via NMSU's Graduate Certificate in Museum Studies, curators of other natural history collections on campus, land managers and owners, researchers, and citizen scientists). The collaborative nature of the project across campus and the region leverages knowledge and expertise in efficient and exciting directions, creating new research and outreach opportunities that make use of these important herbarium collections and their valuable and unique biodiversity information.

For example, some plankton use photosynthesis to convert carbon dioxide into the organic molecules that compose their cells.  About a quarter of these organic molecules are lipids, which serve important roles as structural components of membranes, as energy reserves in oil bodies, and as signaling molecules.   In some planktonic cells there are over one thousand different types of lipid molecules, each playing a distinct and essential role in the metabolism of the cell.  <br/><br/>Planktonic lipids are also important for humans.  They are measured by geoscientists in order to address a wide variety of problems, from understanding when life evolved on Earth, to estimating the temperature of the ocean in geological past, to assessing the health of plankton and their ability to conduct photosynthesis.  Planktonic lipids are also the main components of petroleum, a critical energy source for transportation and industry. Finally, ocean plankton are the sole sources of many ""essential"" lipids that humans require in their diet but cannot efficiently synthesize themselves.  Notable examples are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), which in humans play key roles in cardiovascular health, hormone production, and inflammation management. On average, the global population of humans is chronically deficient in EPA and DHA.  Seafood is essentially the only source of these essential fatty acids to the human diet, and yet we do not know if production of these lipids by marine organisms will be able to keep up with future global demand.<br/><br/>Despite the importance of planktonic lipids, geoscientists have only a basic understanding of lipid distributions in the ocean and cannot predict how lipids will change in response to future global warming.  Results from lab experiments with cultures of phytoplankton suggest the potential for significant future alterations in the types and amounts of lipids produced in the oceans.  The research being conducted as part of this project seeks to address this problem by producing the first global-scale assessment of lipids in the ocean.  The overarching strategy will be to apply lipidomics, a state-of-the-art method for simultaneously analyzing all of the lipids in a plankton cell, to a library of thousands of samples from a broad range of ocean environments.  These environments nearly span the global range in factors thought to affect plankton lipid metabolism.   This project will shed new light on the identity, sources, and fates of the vast diversity of planktonic lipids, and enable scientists to predict and respond to changes in the future output of lipids from the ocean.  The project will also inform our understanding of petroleum formation, and provide geoscientist with better tools for understanding Earth's history.  The scientist would continue his efforts to train the next generation of scientists (postdoc), as well as his quest to educate the community and K-12 students via his science outreach endeavors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Attackers now covertly observe and probe systems for prolonged periods before launching devastating attacks. In such an environment, it has grown prohibitively difficult for system administrators to identify suspicious events, correlate these events into an attack pattern, and determine an appropriate response. Data Provenance is a method of modeling a system's execution in the form of a causal relationship graph, allowing investigators to trace the ancestry of data objects and identify relationships between seemingly independent events. The goal of the proposed work is to develop techniques that enable the use of data provenance as an expressive and efficient monitoring tool in large distributed systems. These mechanisms will enable unprecedented capability to reason about system events, centrally monitor activities within data centers, and express fine-grained enforcement of security properties based on the historical flow of data. Research and software artifacts will be made available to the broader community through the Linux provenance web site.<br/><br/>The proposed work will examine central challenges related to expressivity and scalability that currently prevent the further proliferation of provenance-based auditing techniques. To address the semantic gap that has traditionally prevented system-layer auditing from being able to explain higher-level application behaviors, this project pursues the design of universal provenance mechanisms that leverage binary analysis to transparently identify siloed application-layer logging activities, extract their semantics, and graft the information onto a causal relationship graph that encodes the entire system's execution. Grammar induction techniques will be leveraged to overcome the tremendous storage burden of provenance and provide a scalable central monitoring framework for data centers. After enriching system-layer auditing and enabling the efficient communication of suspicious activities via provenance traces, data provenance will be integrated into enforcement mechanisms to address critical security challenges including regulatory compliance, information flow control, and fault attribution. The advancement of state-of-the-art of provenance-based tracing and enforcement should establish a new baseline for reasoning about the flow of data in today's complex computing systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Persistent environmental monitoring, infrastructure inspection, and security surveillance are essential for large indoor facilities to provide safety and comfort. Existing aerial sensing solutions are mainly for outdoor applications. They are not suitable for human-occupied indoor environments due to short flight duration, disturbing noise level, and safety concerns. The proposed technology is based on specially designed robotic blimps that offer long flight duration, quiet sound profile, and safety for collision. The technology can potentially fill the market vacancy for indoor aerial sensing. In addition to indoor aerial sensing, the robotic blimps can also be marketed as a research and teaching tool for researchers, teachers, students, and hobbyists who are interested in performing indoor experiments on human friendly flying robots. The robotic blimps may also be extended to serve as companion robots for the elderly, or as intelligent toys for children. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project explores the commercial potential of an aerial sensing solution that is developed around a robotic blimp. The blimp is cushioned with Helium-filled envelope, and can fly safely among people. Buoyancy from the Helium gas helps reduce the power consumption of the blimp, enabling it to operate quietly for hours. Unique aerodynamic shape of the blimp ensures high maneuverability in indoor environments. The blimp represents an integration of research efforts in mechatronic design, mobile sensor networks, and control systems. The blimps have been successfully employed to support a broad spectrum of research supported by NSF grants, including indoor wind field mapping, swarming control, and human-robot interactions. The basic functionalities of the blimp are stable and reliable, ready to be transitioned into the commercialization stage.

Free energy methods will be used to compute nucleation barriers and identify metastable intermediates, while path sampling algorithms will be employed to characterize crystallization kinetics and mechanisms. This combination of techniques will reveal the effects of matrix properties (density, surface chemistry, and morphology) on nucleation and thereby transform understanding of the physical processes controlling crystallization in soft matrices.  A course focusing on reproducibility in science will be developed, The Art of Reproducible Science, and will be taught to graduate and undergraduate students at the University of Houston and broadly disseminated through online video tutorials. Outreach activities will be developed to provide K-12 students with opportunities to learn about research and STEM career paths through participation in the annual Lemelson-MIT JV InvenTeams program, GRADE summer program for women and underrepresented minorities, Texas Soft Matter Meeting, and Southwest Catalysis Society Meeting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When char interacts with water, some of it dissolves and is carried away by rivers to the ocean.  This soluble component of char is termed ""dissolved black carbon"" (DBC).  Recent research has revealed DBC to be a major component of the carbon cycle.  Most notably, DBC is now known to make up 10% of all dissolved organic carbon that rivers carry to the sea.  Once in the ocean, DBC remains there for thousands of years, storing carbon that would otherwise be in the atmosphere as carbon dioxide.  As carbon dioxide contributes to the greenhouse effect, with higher carbon dioxide in the atmosphere leading to warmer global temperatures, it is important to understand where DBC in the ocean came from and how long it will stay locked away in the deep ocean.  In this funded work, we set out to determine the source of the DBC in the ocean.  Based upon our previous work that shows rivers export massive amounts of DBC to the coast, it has been suggested that rivers are the main source of DBC to the open ocean.  However, in looking more closely at the DBC in rivers and the oceans, we found them to differ in one critical way: they have different isotopic signatures.  This precludes them from having the same source, indicating that the DBC in the oceans is not from rivers.  Our preliminary work only looked at a small river in Georgia, USA, and in the coastal waters offshore.  In this funded project, we will take a global look at the isotopic signatures of DBC collected from large rivers such as the Amazon, Mississippi, and Yukon, and from the middle of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans.  If we find there is no overlap in the isotopes of the DBC from these major global rivers and ocean waters, we can conclude that rivers are not the main source of oceanic DBC and will need to search for new explanations of how molecules produced by fire end up in the deep ocean.  <br/><br/>The project will enhance the career and continue the training of a first-time investigator and train undergraduate students in real world research through the Northeastern University Cooperative Program.  In addition, our findings be adapted to produce learning materials for high school students in collaboration with the Science Journal for Kids.<br/><br/>Previous efforts to track DBC sources in natural waters have come with major limitations, preventing definitive connections to be made between oceanic DBC and its pyrogenic source.  Photodegradation, a significant removal process for DBC in surface waters, drastically alters the molecular composition of DBC and erases any potential link between DBC chemical composition and its source.  Bulk stable carbon isotopic measurements cannot unambiguously identify sources of DOC subcomponents, such as DBC.  As such, this project aims to constrain the oceanic source of DBC by measuring compound-specific stable carbon isotopes of molecular markers (benzenepolycarboxylic acids, or BPCAs), derived exclusively from DBC.  Our preliminary data show BPCA-specific isotopic values to have a sufficiently wide dynamic range between riverine and oceanic samples to test our hypotheses.  In the current proposal, we aim to 1) isotopically characterize the largest quantified flux of DBC to the ocean (global rivers), 2) assess in situ oceanic variation in DBC stable carbon isotopic signatures, and 3) investigate the potential BPCA-specific fractionation effects of DBC photodegradation.  In establishing a robust tracer for DBC source, we will be able to accurately constrain sources of oceanic DBC and further investigate the biogeochemical cycling of DBC across the terrestrial-marine continuum.  The results of our research will also assist in answering larger research questions, specifically those regarding the fate of terrigenous DOM in the ocean, which have plagued biogeochemists for decades.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many questions remain about the fundamental earth processes that create the volcanoes of the Hawaii-Emperor chain and elsewhere, and how the enormous mass of these volcanos is supported by the rock material below them.  This study will involve two seagoing expeditions to seismically image the magmatic crust created by the hotspot and obtain critical information about the crust's volume, its composition, how it varies along the island chain, and how the tectonic plate deforms in response to the weight of the volcanoes. In addition to gaining fundamental insight into the formation of the Hawaiian-Emperor chain, the study will also be beneficial to a more comprehensive assessment of geohazards for the Hawaiian island region.  Seismic data will image faults within the volcanic edifice and in the surrounding oceanic crust that can be used to evaluate seismic, tsunami and submarine landslide hazards. The project involves strong national and international collaborations. The research cruises will provide excellent opportunities to involve students in data acquisition and analysis, and the results will be the basis for a large public outreach and education effort.<br/><br/>The scientific objectives of the planned data acquisition and analysis of this project are to examine controls on magmatic addition along the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, provide fundamental constraints on rheological properties of oceanic lithosphere, address the origin of the hotspot swell, and assess implications for earthquakes and tsunamis from plate deformation in response to flexure. The plan is to acquire coincident 2D, deep-penetration seismic reflection data as well as wide-angle reflection/refraction data using ocean bottom seismometers spaced at 15 km along four 500-km-long transects across the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain.  The locations of these transects will encompass wide variations in the timing of magma emplacement and volume flux, the age of the lithosphere at the time of loading and the presence/absence of a topographic swell. The transects are sufficiently long to capture the flexural response of the lithosphere to volcano loading out to the flexural bulge. The processed seismic reflection profiles and velocity models created from wide-angle seismic data will constrain the volume and distribution of magmatic addition to the crust as well as faulting within the volcanic edifice and within the loaded oceanic plate. New seismic constraints will be combined with gravity, magnetic, bathymetric and geochemical data and used as the basis for flexural analysis and numerical modeling to gain fundamental new insights into crust and lithosphere dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite extensive study of mature dunes, the question of ""How do wind-blown dunes form?"" remains unanswered, yet it is central to understanding dunes as major geological units, particularly given their increasing occurrence in desert regions of the United States and their adverse impact on water and vegetation supplies. This research will examine the key inter-relationships between airflow, surface properties, changes in sand transport and bedform shape that lie behind a meaningful understanding of how nascent dunes emerge. The project will promote international collaboration among the United States, the United Kingdom, and Namibia. It will generate public educational materials about desert landscapes and geomorphology, foster partnerships with National Parks in both the United States and Namibia, and provide quality scientific training and field experience to students.<br/><br/>Field monitoring of surface properties and bedform change at high resolution will be performed at three carefully chosen locations of known dune development. Complementary laboratory experiments will enable accurate characterization of flow very close to the 3D surface of modelled dunes that, together with the field datasets, will drive a computer model to test the sensitivity of dune initiation and growth to different controls in a range of environmental conditions in deserts, coasts and on other planets. In concert, this approach represents an opportunity to overcome an enduring plateau for understanding the origins of one of the major terrestrial landform systems. The team will work with staff at Great Sand Dunes National Park in the United States and the Namib-Naukluft National Park in Namibia to create broadly accessible public engagement materials. At a dedicated impact workshop in Gobabeb, Namibia, the team will showcase to interested local Namibian and international delegates the project findings and how these findings could be used to influence societal and economic issues.

These 3D printed ceramic parts will find use in various areas including sustainable infrastructure, transportation, clean energy, water management, aerospace, and healthcare. Such technological advances in manufacturing advanced materials using EM waves will lead to a smaller energy footprint compared to conventional methods and as such can provide significant savings in energy use in the manufacture of high-strength materials. This research requires linking together advances in multiple disciplines such as electrical and computer engineering, electromagnetics, materials science, mechanical, and chemical engineering. Accordingly, an integrated research and education plan using game-based technology enhanced learning will allow students to explore this multidisciplinary area through hands-on training and visualization of materials processing.  Popular builder's games are well equipped for teaching students how building (processing) can change the way materials assemble (structure) and lead to differences in properties such as mechanical behavior and strength.

Cryoplanation terraces are large upland landform features that give the impression of gigantic staircases, found in periglacial, or cold but nonglacial environments.  Although these elevated bedrock terraces have been identified and discussed in scientific literature for more than a century, debate continues about the nature of the processes responsible for their formation.  Development rates, calculated from dates of rock exposure across terrace treads, will be used to test one of the more prominent hypotheses advanced in the literature.  This hypothesis states that these terraces are formed through intensified erosion associated with snowbanks that last well into the summer months.  Recent methodological developments in geochemistry, specifically the method known as cosmogenic nuclide dating, will provide the infusion of contemporary technology necessary to make progress on this long-standing scientific issue, and has the potential to make transformative advances in the understanding of landscape development in periglacial regions.  Results from this research will be shared with the U.S. National Park Service and used to enhance park management as well as the experiences of park visitors through development of interpretive displays and trail guides in several national parks and monuments.  Further, the project will enable a graduate student to establish an independent research career.<br/><br/>The great antiquity of cryoplanation terraces makes terrestrial cosmogenic nuclides the most appropriate dating method for determining their age and rates of development.  Rock samples for cosmogenic nuclide dating were collected from two locations in the interior of Alaska using a transect-based sampling strategy across individual terrace treads.  Dating the exposure of the clastic rocks (clasts) will facilitate calculation of erosion rates for individual terraces, and can be compared to known erosion rates at existing late-lying snowbanks.  The PIs hypothesize that: (a) calculated development rates will be comparable with those of measured snowbank erosion; (b) exposure dates for individual rock clasts will coincide with Quaternary cold intervals; and (c) terrace treads are time-transgressive surfaces with the exposure age of clasts increasing toward the outer edge of terraces.  The landforms in this region where the rocks for this analysis were collected are representative of those in the much larger domain of unglaciated landscapes of the Northern Hemisphere.  Therefore, the methodologic and analytic approach adopted for this project are potentially applicable throughout this vast region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

First responders need information about the extent of problems, citizens would like information about cities where friends and relatives live, and government planners and researchers would like to design stronger infrastructure. However, information about the location of problems and speed of recovery can be slow to emerge during a disaster, and often remains imprecise and incomplete days or even weeks afterwards. Internet outage measurements can be a sensor to measure the effects natural disasters. The principal investigator and his team have shown that Internet outages can be observed from a few central sites--their work on Trinocular has been peer reviewed and they have been collecting data twenty four hours a day, seven days a week for more than two years. Serious natural disasters often result in Internet outages, typically because of power or communication loss due to utility pole failure, flooding, or wire breakage; this correlation has been shown by several groups. While the team makes outage data available to researchers today, this data is currently inaccessible to lay-people and even scientists, since they cannot easily browse the data or drill down into regions of interest. This project makes Internet outage data accessible through a new, interactive website, with goals of directly assisting citizens, first responders, and scientists to understand the scope of disasters and their recovery. Second, this website and data is used to compare the team's outage data with two sources of ""ground truth"" outages from disasters. A primary source of ground truth will be the Federal Communications Commission's (FCC's) NORS (Network Outage Reporting System): these industry-reported outages are the data the U.S. Government uses today to assess the status of the U.S. telecommunications system.

It is motivated by developments in computational neuroscience where it has become increasingly clear that the sense in which the brain is computational is completely different from digital computation, the kind that predominates computer science. The researcher will develop an empirically-informed philosophical account of neural computation by drawing on current research in neuroscience and in historical research on analog computation. The results of this interdisciplinary project will contribute to the theoretical understanding of intriguing claims by psychologists and neuroscientists about the computational nature of the mind and brain. Findings are to be presented at conferences and workshops in computational neuroscience and in philosophy of science. The results of this research are to be published in an interdisciplinary monograph suitable for researchers in the cognitive science community. More broadly, the findings will be incorporated in courses to help students in both the sciences and humanities to make better sense of these kinds of claims.<br/><br/>Despite the early intellectual exchanges between neuroscience and the study of theoretical computation, it is no longer clear precisely what is meant by claims that the brain computes. Because the brain cannot be a digital computer of the kind whose theoretical underpinnings are found with the Turing Machine, claims that the brain is computational are either vacuous or metaphorical, or in need of a principled account of computation. This research project will provide such an account. It will serve to advance philosophy of neuroscience, and it will provide much-needed theoretical support to computational neuroscientists' claims that the brain is a computer, an intriguing idea that has yet to be carefully articulated. Current ideas about computation have largely ignored analog computation, which was once a thriving paradigm for computational practice. The rehabilitation of analog computation would add to our intellectual repertoire for thinking about other systems as computational.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is critical to understand these patterns to explain the very low presence of female inventors in today's innovation economy. This problem holds significant implications for the inclusive growth of economies. To better understand the gap, this project examines the differences in the regional context where female and male inventors operate. While prior work has explored the role of location (e.g. agglomerations of firms) on innovation, little is known about the role of location on gender-based inventor activity. The goal of this project is to fill this hole by examining key questions such as: Where are female inventors located? What locations and fields have a higher relative presence of FIs (i.e., higher inclusivity)? Within given regions what types of organizations are more inclusive? Do regional industry clusters support higher rates of FIs? How do female versus male inventors source knowledge inside their organizations and in the external environment? To answer these questions, the research develops new indicators on the geography of inventors and their patents by gender. The mapping of inventors is extended to European Union countries to aid comparability in FI inclusivity across countries, and inform policies to promote gender equality. The project also develops an inventor mapping tool that provides interactive maps and visualizations that help policy makers, firms, and researchers to understand variation across regions in the participation and performance of inventors by gender. In this way, this project can inform the design of policy initiatives (e.g., programs to mobilize inventors) to influence locational attributes and firm practices that could reduce the inventor gender gap and, ultimately, reduce the inefficiencies in the match between science and technology skills and innovation.<br/><br/>To address our core questions regarding the gender gap, this project develops new statistics on female inventor inclusivity (e.g., percent of inventors that are women and the percent of patents attributed to women) at the organization, field (industry cluster and technology class), and regional levels since 2000 onwards. These inclusivity indicators, together with data on STEM education and occupations, will identify what locational and organizational attributes are associated with female participation. Beyond detailed descriptive analysis and visualizations, the new data is used to assess a variety of explanations for the gender gap in patenting. First, women are not selecting STEM-based skills that are compatible with participation in patenting. Two, women in STEM are under-represented in patent-intensive fields and organizations. Third, women are more geographically constrained than men (e.g., due to lower income or family obligations), and so, they could benefit specially from being in locations and organizations where is easier to access knowledge and collaborate with nearby inventors. Overall, this work offers important policy and managerial advice to improve the inclusivity and performance of the innovation economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Regeneration of the natural bone is an additive advantage over currently used fixative implants. These implants are also a source of secondary infections and fracture, such risks are mitigated with the formation of natural tissues, eliminating the need for surgical recall. The U.S. reports ~7.5 million Emergency Department visits related to craniomaxillofacial (CMF) injuries, at a cost of $55.2 billion annually. The technology proposes a fundamental shift in CMF bone reconstruction, allowing regeneration of craniofacial bone using guided 3D printed osteoconductive scaffolds. This translates to reflecting a soft tissue flap over a defect to allow a laser or image guided analyzer to study the defect volume and contours, after which a robotic extruder deposits the scaffold into the desired area.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project addresses reconstruction of craniomaxillofacial (CMF) bone defects caused by trauma, developmental anomalies or benign/malignant tumors. Our technology is transforming CMF reconstruction by 3D printing osteoconductive/inductive scaffolds directly into defects.  Preliminary studies on critical-sized calvarial defects in a rat model demonstrated the regeneration of bone while preserving dural tissue. A methacrylated Gelatin-Laponite nanosilicate bio-ink was utilized to print a mesh-like scaffold for a critical-sized defect in rat calvaria. The in-situ printing in the defects helped maintain the micro-pattern stability of the scaffold and the nano-silicate particle-enhanced bone regeneration. These results indicated the possibility of overcoming the current shortcomings in osseous tissue regeneration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Student Research Workshop helps create a new generation of researchers with a more thorough understanding of their field, with connections and collaborations across institutions, and with innovative and exciting research programs. This contributes to America's pool of researchers with the needed scientific and engineering knowledge and skills. The workshop encourages a spirit of collaborative research and builds a supportive environment for a new generation of computational linguists. <br/><br/>The Student Research Workshop solicits two categories of submissions: research papers and research proposals. The research proposal can have only one author who must be a student. The research papers can have multiple authors, with the first author being a student (at either the graduate or undergraduate level). The workshop is a venue for students to receive constructive critical feedback on their work from experts outside of their institution, and to connect with other students and senior researchers in their field. The students gain exposure by presenting their work earlier than they would otherwise (i.e., in a form not yet ready for the main conference). This is particularly valuable for students from smaller institutions and undergraduate students. In addition, the workshop is organized and run by students.

Understanding how energy fluxes and consumer-resource interactions vary in these kelp communities is critical for defining robust management strategies that help maintain these valuable ecosystem services. In this integrated research and education program, the project team will investigate how consumer populations respond to variability in temperature, carbonate chemistry and resource quality to influence the food webs and ecosystem stability of kelp forests. A comprehensive suite of studies conducted at the northern range limit for giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera) in SE Alaska will examine how kelp communities respond to variable environmental conditions arising from seasonal variability and changing ocean temperature and acidification conditions. As part of this project, undergraduate and high school students will receive comprehensive training through (1) an immersive field-based class in Sitka Sound, Alaska, (2) intensive, mentored research internships, and (3) experiential training in science communication and public outreach that will include a variety of opportunities to disseminate research findings through podcasts, public lectures and radio broadcasts. <br/><br/>Consumer-resource interactions structure food webs and govern ecosystem stability, yet our understanding of how these important interactions may change under future climatic conditions is hampered by the complexity of direct and indirect effects of multiple stressors within and between trophic levels. For example, environmentally mediated changes in nutritional quality and chemical deterrence of primary producers have the potential to alter herbivory rates and energy fluxes between primary producers and consumers, with implications for ecosystem stability. Moreover, the effects of global change on primary producers are likely to depend on other limiting resources, such as light and nutrients, which vary seasonally in dynamic, temperate and high latitude ecosystems. In marine ecosystems at high latitude, climate models predict that ocean acidification will be most pronounced during the winter months, when primary production is limited by light. This project is built around the hypothesis that there could be a mismatch in the energetic demands of primary consumers caused by warming and ocean acidification and resource availability and quality during winter months, with cascading effects on trophic structure and ecosystem stability in the future. Through complementary lab and field experiments, the project team will determine 1) how temperature and carbonate chemistry combine to affect primary consumer bioenergetics across a diversity of species and 2) the indirect effects of ocean acidification and warming on primary consumers via environmentally mediated changes in the availability, nutritional quality and palatability of primary producers across seasons. Using the data from the laboratory and field experiments, the project team will 3) construct a model of the emergent effects of warming and ocean acidification on trophic structure and ecosystem stability in seasonally dynamic, high latitude environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When a person is inoculated with a vaccine (by injection, nose or mouth) the body's immune system learns how to confront the harmless version of the disease by creating appropriate antibodies.  The body then ""remembers"" the germ and what is required should another attack occur.  To achieve clinical benefits, since tumors use many strategies to suppress the body's immune system, therapeutic cancer vaccines must include strong ""adjuvants,"" which are substances that are added to vaccines to improve the body's immune response to the vaccine.  The use of adjuvants decreases the amount of vaccine needed to overcome the tumor-related immune suppression, which improves vaccine safety. Though a wide variety of adjuvants are available and have been shown to activate immune cells in laboratory experiments, only a few have reached the clinical stage. Effectiveness and safety concerns are the major challenges that have limited the translation of many adjuvants to the clinical setting. To amplify the effectiveness and safety of two representative molecular adjuvants, this project uses ""rational molecular design,"" which is a strategy for creating new molecules with a desired functionality, based upon having the ability to use physical models to predict how the molecule's structure will affect its behavior. The PI will construct a series of chemically modified immune response modifiers (IRMs) and define the molecular structure-based design rules governing the adjuvant-immune system interactions at the tissue, cellular, and subcellular levels. The knowledge gained through these efforts will bridge the gap between synthetic chemistry and immunology, and give rise to the design of the next generation of molecular adjuvants for cancer vaccines. The results obtained from these studies can be applied to vaccines other than cancer, where adjuvant efficacy and safety are needed. In addition, the research will be directly integrated into educational programs, including enhancement of the Graduate Certificate Program in Polymer Engineering, with the goal of attracting underrepresented minorities to the excitement and career opportunities in the emerging field of immunobioengineering.<br/><br/><br/>This project focuses on integrating molecular engineering and immunology to gain fundamental insight into important aspects of how to rationally design molecular adjuvants for therapeutic cancer vaccines that are safe and can overcome tumor related immune suppression.  Although potent in vitro, most adjuvants do not have the desired physiochemical and pharmacokinetic properties to activate antigen presenting cells (APCs) in lymph nodes (LNs), the anatomical sites where the anti-tumor immunity is initiated. A comprehensive set of studies involving synthetic chemistry and immunology has been designed to amplify the adjuvant function and safety of two representative immune response modifiers (IRMs). A series of lymph node targeting IRMs will be constructed and used to define the molecular structure-based design rules governing the adjuvants-immune system interactions at the tissue, cellular, and subcellular levels. The research objectives are: 1) To synthesize LN-targeting immune response modifiers (IRMs) with a pH sensitive linker and define the structure-based design rules that govern lymph node accumulation via ""albumin-hitchhiking"" (adjuvants bind to endogenous albumin protein and transport to lymph nodes), immune cell uptake and activation; 2) To amplify the magnitude and function of the T cell immunity by combining LN-targeting IRMs and an LN-targeting, thymidine-rich oligonucleotide and 3) To establish the functional and safety impact of this localized IRMs approach in therapeutic treatment of cancer.  Vaccine efficacy, both prophylactic (prior to injection of melanoma producing OVA-B16F10 cells) and therapeutic (after melanoma establishment), will be evaluated in C57BL/6 mice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Symptoms and progression of JIA vary greatly between individuals, and there are many possible treatment options depending on the extent of disease. However, diagnosing JIA on a patient-by-patient basis is difficult because reliable tools for assessing the condition do not yet exist, and treatment is often a trial-and-error process. This project will focus on developing wearable joint health-sensing systems that continuously provide data on joint condition, inside and out of the clinic. The PI will focus on advancing the ability to measure and analyze sounds produced by joints during movement. The study will test the hypothesis that joint sounds decrease as joint health improves with therapy. Sounds collected with the wearable devices will be analyzed and compared with patients' joint health to understand possible relationships that can be used to improve diagnostic capabilities. Research and education are integrated through the incorporation of undergraduate research teams in the sensing brace design process and incorporating de-identified dataset analysis in courses at Georgia Institute of Technology. Additionally, the PI will host K-12 teachers in his lab to develop science and engineering modules to take back their classrooms.<br/><br/>Dr. Inan's long-term career goal is to fundamentally advance knowledge in the field of wearable joint health sensing and, thereby, enable personalized therapies and devices for patients with joint disorders, such as arthritis. Toward this goal, Dr. Inan's research objectives are to: (1) design and implement a sensing brace capable of accurately measuring the sounds of the joints in the clinic and at home; (2) investigate algorithms for quantifying differences between the characteristics of joint sounds of patients with JIA and healthy controls; and (3) conduct a feasibility study in patients with JIA by sending the sensing brace home and evaluating the changes in joint sound characteristics measured throughout treatment. The PI's preliminary data suggests that joint sounds can potentially serve as a physiological biomarker for patients with arthritis. The project will first develop a wearable heterogenous sensor array for acoustical sensing with sufficient battery life. Experiments will collect joint sound data from JIA-affected and healthy patients. Graph mining algorithms will be applied to analyze the high-dimensional joint acoustical emissions data and correlate the data with joint health. At project completion, Dr. Inan will have developed a new physiological measurement tool for diagnosing and treating JIA patients based on their specific symptoms and responses to treatment, ultimately improving their quality of life and minimizing permanent joint damage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ideal of rational government administration has been historically variable. Before 1870, the national government was largely undeveloped and local governments were in the pockets of political machines. Over the next century, calls for moral rectitude and bureaucratic integrity gave way to calls for effectiveness and efficiency, which eventually led to a regime of optimization and the adoption of cost-benefit analysis as the core of administrative decision-making.  This project investigates this history and tests its argument on two case studies.  The findings from this research will inform and illuminate efforts to use modern technologies of rationalization to deal with current problems.<br/><br/>This project uses archival research, text analysis, and interviews to explain the historical processes by which cost-benefit analysis and its attendant assumptions came to be adopted by government in the U.S.  For the first part, the text of documents such as the Congressional record, scholarly journals and presidential speeches is analyzed, plus historical informants active in this process from the 1960s to the present are interviewed.

User interfaces that adapt themselves to available user information (such as special needs or individual preferences) are becoming increasingly important, so much so that adaptability has become a selling point for software products.  A system with the ability to construct and consult a user model (an explicit representation of properties of a particular user or group of users) can adapt diverse aspects of its performance and enhance its effectiveness, usability and/or acceptance in a variety of situations (e.g., to reduce information overload, to improve the quality of information retrieval, filtering and annotation, and to generate useful information visualizations).  Applications for user modeling range from electronic commerce and intelligent learning environments to health care and assistive technologies.  Relevant platforms for user modeling include mobile and wearable systems and smart environments, as well as individual desktop systems, groupware, adaptive hypermedia, and other web-based systems.  The annual UMAP conference is the premier forum at which academic and industrial researchers from all these fields gather to present their latest research and to exchange their complementary insights on user modeling issues. Attending and presenting their work at UMAP will have a significant impact on the careers of the future generation of user modeling, adaptation, and personalization researchers.  More information about the conference is available online at http://www.um.org/umap2018/.  <br/><br/>Student authors at UMAP and attendees in the Doctoral Consortium will both have the opportunity to present their work to a knowledgeable audience and through lively discussions get useful comments at an early stage of their research when it will be most useful.  Just as importantly, they will have a chance to meet established researchers and other graduate students doing similar work, to exchange ideas and to make contacts that will be invaluable to them as they progress in their scientific careers.  Interacting with young researchers is also beneficial to experienced investigators, by providing fresh ideas and new perspectives.  Thus, the Doctoral Consortium is a great confidence builder for the students involved, and highly stimulating to the senior researchers as well.   Students whose work has been selected for presentation at the Doctoral Consortium will be invited to write a paper that will be published in the UMAP 2018 conference proceedings, which will be included in the ACM Digital Library.  They will have a 30-minute window in which to present their work (with a short demonstration where appropriate), including time for questions and discussion.  During the question/discussion period and in subsequent informal interactions, organizing committee members and other participants will provide constructive comments on each student's work and attempt to address aspects on which the student has requested advice.  The organizers have reaffirmed the long-standing and demonstrated UMAP commitment to diversity; to this end, they will make special efforts to recruit women and members of under-represented groups when selecting the candidates to receive financial support.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Modern settings, however, such as the Internet of Things and machine-to-machine communication, require devices to communicate short messages with very small delays while maintaining a high degree of reliability. This conjures up a long-standing challenge in coding theory: design low-complexity channel codes that provide high reliability and low latency. This project aims to develop error-correcting technologies well-suited to such demands of the evolving information infrastructure.<br/><br/>This research will investigate two rich classes of code-designs: stream codes and Reed-Muller codes. Stream codes, recently proposed by the investigator and co-authors, combine the powerful features of convolutional encoding and iterative decoding, while Reed-Muller codes are classic code designs that have recently been shown to achieve capacity in erasure channels. Preliminary studies suggest that both stream and Reed-Muller codes have remarkable performance at short lengths, but using highly complex decoders, posing the issue of whether computationally efficient decoder may be found. This project focuses on developing novel algorithmic and analytical frameworks aiming to: (i) design efficient decoding algorithms; (ii) develop new theoretical frameworks for the analysis of the proposed algorithms; and (iii) establish fundamental length-rate-complexity trade-offs in the non-asymptotic regime.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will establish the mathematical foundations for resource allocation, coupled with computational algorithms and empirical validation methods, for prescriptive and predictive analysis in determining facility locations and associated pricing. Prescriptive analysis helps competing entities in optimizing their scheduling and facility location decisions. Predictive analysis helps central authorities (e.g., government and regulators) in optimizing system efficiency and equity through infrastructure investments, incentives creation, and regulations. Under this project's integrated vision for research and education, the research program directly informs the educational program. The educational program includes the development and dissemination of an active learning module for high-school mathematics focused on underrepresented minority students; an undergraduate research internship program for underprepared prospective engineering students; and undergraduate and graduate course development in OR and game theory. These educational activities contribute toward strengthening and diversifying the pipeline of researchers and practitioners skilled in OR and analytics, in turn fostering the long-term growth of the very disciplines which the research program builds upon. Educational and outreach activities also focus on highlighting the economic, social and political complexities associated with planning and operations of civil infrastructure systems.<br/><br/>Scheduling and facility location problems (together called as spatio-temporal location problems) share similar underlying mathematical structures that allow researchers to analyze them jointly. However, under dynamic pricing, spatio-temporal location decisions become interdependent with pricing decisions which are made at a later stage through complex interactions between competing service providers and their customers. This necessitates the use of two-stage game theoretic models. This project develops a comprehensive framework that relies on combining and mutually reinforcing mathematical, computational and empirical insights. The key innovations are the tight interplay between mathematical, computational and empirical ideas, a holistic approach that enables the optimal tradeoff between modeling precision and solution tractability, and a comprehensive testbed comprising large-scale real-world networks from aviation, railways, transit, hotels and gasoline distribution. The project not only makes deep contributions to the theoretical and applied research in competitive transportation scheduling, but also triggers further exploration enabling similar future contributions to the competitive facility location theory and applications. Additionally, this general approach could be usefully employed in other, otherwise intractable, applications of multi-stage game theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Three goals animate the design of this project. The first is to increase the diversity of students pursuing STEM disciplines. The second is to increase retention and completion of the MCC STEM Scholars. The third is to generate knowledge about specific ways project activities and other relevant factors influence the educational experiences and success of the scholarship recipients. Towards these goals the project's principal investigators will carry out a holistic and systematic range of activities. Such activities will include on-site outreach and recruitment efforts at area high schools with significant minority and low-income populations, on-going individual and cohort-based experiences designed to promote retention and student success, and embedded knowledge-generating efforts guided by a partnership between MCC and university researchers. <br/><br/>Although community colleges possess a large pool of potential STEM talent, greater supports are needed to ensure that they can place their students on a promising path toward success, especially low-income students. Recent evidence has suggested that holistic, rather than singular approaches to student support offer greater benefits to community college student retention and completion. At the same time, while research has demonstrated the positive impact of multiple services and supports on community college student success, there remains limited evidence on precisely how and why such approaches work. Exploring such efforts can help identify the most effective strategies to improve student persistence and completion in STEM. This project not only integrates a variety of supports to assist community college students in succeeding in STEM, particularly those who are low-income and academically talented, but also examines how such efforts work and why. The empirical knowledge derived from the embedded research, assessment, and evaluation will inform small (and typically under-resourced) community colleges on how to reconcile and coordinate various institutional supports, as well as on how to institutionalize and sustain cost-effective, collaborative efforts to assist academically talented low-income STEM students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Thwaites Glacier system dominates the contribution to sea-level rise from Antarctica. Predicting how this system will evolve in coming decades, and thereby its likely contribution to sea level, requires detailed understanding of how it has responded to changes in climate and oceanographic conditions in the past. This project will provide a record of regional sea-level change by establishing chronologies for raised marine beaches as well as the timing and duration of periods of retreat of Thwaites Glacier during the past 10,000 years by sampling and dating bedrock presently covered by Thwaites Glacier via subglacial drilling. Together with climatic and oceanographic conditions from other records, these will provide boundary conditions for past-to-present model simulations as well as those used to predict future glacier changes under a range of climate scenarios. Specifically, the project will test the hypothesis--implied by existing geological evidence from the region--that present rapid retreat of the Thwaites Glacier system is reversible. <br/><br/>The team aims to utilize two approaches: 1. To reconstruct relative sea level during the Holocene, it will map and date raised marine and shoreline deposits throughout Pine Island Bay. Chronological constraints on sea-level change will be provided by radiocarbon dating of organic material in landforms and sediments that are genetically related to past sea level, such as shell fragments, bones of marine fauna, and penguin guano. 2. To obtain geological evidence for past episodes of grounding-line retreat, the team will apply cosmogenic-nuclide exposure-dating of subglacial bedrock. Using drill systems recently developed for subglacial bedrock recovery, the team will obtain subglacial bedrock from sites where ice thickness is dynamically linked to grounding-line position in the Thwaites system (specifically in the Hudson Mountains, and near Mount Murphy). Observation of significant cosmogenic-nuclide concentrations--the team will primarily measure Beryllium-10 and in situ Carbon-14--in these samples would provide direct, unambiguous evidence for past episodes of thinning linked to grounding-line retreat as well as constraints on their timing and duration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cellulose is an important component of food, fiber, textiles, and fuel for human and forage animals.  While many of the enzymes that participate in cellulose synthesis in land plants have been identified, it is still unclear how plants make the decision to produce more or less cellulose.  The Wallace lab will use advanced genetic, biochemical, and cell biological techniques to elucidate how cellulose biosynthesis is controlled during normal plant development and in response to changing environmental conditions, such as heat, drought, salt stress, and limiting nutrients.  This information will be utilized to engineer plants with increased cellulose contents that could be used as biomass feedstocks for the synthesis of sustainable value-added products or as more efficient feedstocks for forage animals.  By understanding how cellulose biosynthesis is controlled, the investigator also expects to provide a foundation for understanding how this fundamental feature of plant cell biology is linked to plant growth and development.  Additionally, this project will support the research training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students from diverse and under-represented backgrounds.  This project will also support the course development of a quantitative mass spectrometry module for undergraduate students as well as public outreach through local agricultural events and web-based videos.<br/>   <br/>The long-term goal is to understand how plant cellulose biosynthesis is controlled by post-translational phosphorylation, and to utilize this knowledge to increase cellulose output under changing environmental conditions.  The central hypothesis guiding this research effort is that CESA (Cellulose synthase A) subunits and other CSC (Cellulose Synthase Complex) components are phosphorylated by protein kinases involved in the brassinosteroid signaling cascade, and these phosphorylation events regulate CSC velocity or subcellular localization.  Specific Aim 1 employs biochemical and genetic methods to identify brassinosteroid-regulated protein kinases that phosphorylate and regulate components of the CSC and to understand how these regulatory events control plant growth and development.  Specific Aim 2 utilizes advanced quantitative proteomic methods to investigate how changing environmental conditions lead to alterations in CSC phosphorylation.  Specific Aim 3 focuses on determining how phosphorylation of CESA subunits influences the in vitro enzymatic activity of cellulose biosynthesis.

Both the fluid and the surface may move and their motion is coupled.  This coupling makes prediction of the motion difficult and leads to new phenomena. In this work, liquid motion on soft substrates will be investigated by both theory and experiments through four research problems. The first research thrust relates to the surface-tension driven wave motion in liquids on soft solids, and is relevant to technologies such as inkjet printing and microfluidics.   The second area involves the motion of a drop on a soft surface due to gradients in the stiffness of the surface, and is relevant to the motion of cancer cells in human tissues.  The third investigation involves splashing of liquids on soft surfaces, and could impact forensic analysis and the aerosol delivery of drugs to neonates.  The final objective involves the spreading of liquids on deformable viscoelastic solids, and is applicable to the manufacture of flexible electronics and the design of biomedical devices.  The research is integrated with undergraduate education through long-term, focused projects and undergraduate summer research experiences, and with graduate education through curriculum development and graduate student research and mentoring activities.<br/><br/>The interaction of soft substrates with fluid interfaces is common to many biological, medical, and industrial processes; flexible electronics are manufactured using immersion lithography, ultrasonic waves are used for medical imaging of soft tissue interfaces, aerosol drug delivery for neonates suffering from respiratory distress syndrome as well as adults being treated for asthma and COPD relies upon droplet deposition on biological tissue, and forensic analysis interprets complex blood splat patterns. Describing these substrate deformations has led to the development of the field of elastocapillarity, in which elastic stresses are coupled to surface tension (capillarity). The aim of this CAREER award is to advance the field of elastocapillary fluid mechanics through carefully-selected theoretical and experimental studies of four canonical problems that focus on the dynamic coupling between the elastic and fluid fields: elastocapillary waves, droplet durotaxis, spreading on compliant substrates, and drop impact. Theoretical models will describe capillary instabilities in soft solids, Marangoni-driven flows that arise from gradients in substrate elasticity (durotaxis), and contact-line dynamics during spreading on compliant substrates. Table-top experiments on drop impact will be designed to facilitate undergraduate learning through research. Elastocapillarity is a new, interdisciplinary field that encompasses a wide range of traditional disciplines, such as fluid mechanics, solid mechanics, and mathematics. The lack of a well-developed course curriculum and a continuously evolving subject matter requires innovative strategies to educate students in this emerging interdisciplinary field, broadly categorized as ""learning through research"", which incorporate focused long-term Creative Inquiry projects and summer research opportunities.

The fate of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet (WAIS) is one of the largest uncertainties in projections of sea-level change. Thwaites Glacier (TG) is a primary contributor to sea-level rise and its flow is accelerating. This faster flow is a response to reduced buttressing from its thinning, floating ice shelf, and is ultimately caused by ocean-driven melting. The degree to which costly and geopolitically-challenging sea-level rise will occur therefore hangs to a large extent on ice-ocean interactions beneath such Antarctic ice shelves. However, the Thwaites system is not sufficiently well understood, exposing a significant gap in our understanding of WAIS retreat, its ocean-driven forcing, and the consequences for sea level.  The chief regulators of TG's retreat are ice and ocean processes in its grounding zone, the location where the ice flowing from inland goes afloat. Ice and ocean processes at this precise locale are central to our understanding of sea-level rise, yet key variables have not been constrained by observation. Model projections of TG's future display extreme sensitivity to melting in the grounding zone and how that melting is applied. Equally-credible melt rates and grounding-zone glaciological treatments yield divergent trajectories for the future of West Antarctica, ranging from little change to large-scale ice sheet collapse with a half a meter or more of sea-level rise. The enormous uncertainty in outcome stems from the lack of observations in this critical grounding zone region.  The enhanced understanding of melting of TG's ice shelf that will come from this project's focused observational program will be built into state-of-the-art coupled ice-sheet and ocean models. These physics-rich, high-resolution models will allow the potential sea-level contribution of TG to be bounded to an unprecedented degree.<br/><br/>This project will enable global and regional climate modelers to make a substantial improvement to projections of future ocean conditions over the continental shelf by providing physics-based projections of TG's sea-level contribution. The team proposes a suite of integrated activities: (1) multi-year oceanographic time series from beneath TG's ice shelf to quantify melting processes that need inclusion in ocean models, with a strong focus on the grounding zone, (2) analogous measurements on the glacier to validate processes governing grounding-line retreat, (3) coupling of these in situ measurements with novel, high-resolution space-borne observations, (4) building this new understanding into state-of-the-art ocean (MIT General Circulation Model and Imperial College Ocean Model) and ice sheet (WAVI) models to correctly simulate the TG system, (5) coupling the models and running with realistic present-day ocean forcing to project the state of TG basin over the next hundred years. The international team will use a range of techniques, from the well-established, such as using a hot-water drill to instrument the ice column and water column in the grounding zone, through to the cutting-edge, such as deploying a borehole deployable remotely operated vehicle to survey the grounding zone, and using phase-coherent radar to monitor ice strain and basal melt rates. The outcome of the project will be a more complete understanding of the TG system in the critical zone extending from a few kilometers inland of the grounding line, through the grounding zone, and out under the ice shelf.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ocean sediments contain abundant microfossils that are an important archive of past climate information with near-global coverage. To place an ocean sediment sample into context, researchers need two kinds of information: (1) an interpretation of the climate represented by that sample and (2) the age of the sample. Age information is crucial for reconstructing the rate and sequence of climate changes globally. Some sediments are well-dated using radiocarbon. However, the ages of many samples can only be estimated indirectly, resulting in age uncertainties as large as 4,000 years. This research project aims to improve these indirect age estimates using statistical analysis of the available radiocarbon-dated samples. Improvements in indirect age estimates will be used to increase the accuracy of global datasets of climate changes for the past 150,000 years.<br/><br/>More specifically, the aim of this project is to improve indirect age estimates derived from the stratigraphic alignment of benthic delta18O (a proxy for global ice volume and deep ocean temperature). A major source of uncertainty in these ages derives from differences of up to 4,000 years in the timing of benthic delta18O change observed at a few core sites with very accurate radiocarbon models. However, little is known about how the timing of benthic delta18O signals differs at other locations. The research approach for this project incorporates ocean circulation models, paleoclimate data (benthic delta18O and 14C from ~100 globally distributed sediment cores), and statistical inference. Phase one of the project is to characterize benthic delta18O age differences (delta18O lags) globally using radiocarbon data from ~100 sediment cores in conjunction with results from ocean circulation models. Phase two is to apply the results from phase one to develop improved methods for delta18O alignment. Phase three is to generate a new database of improved delta18O age models. Thus, the final products of the project will be (1) probabilistic stacks (averages) describing regional and global patterns of benthic delta18O variability, (2) probabilistic algorithms for multiproxy core alignments and for generating Bayesian inferences of delta18O lags, (3) a database of age models for ~300 cores with benthic delta18O data, and (4) estimates of ocean circulation changes based on comparing benthic del18O data with different circulation model scenarios.<br/><br/>This project has broader impacts for climate change research and education. Accurate paleoclimate age estimates are crucial for creating data compilations that are used to test the effectiveness of climate models and improve confidence in their ability to simulate potential future climate changes. The spatial coverage of paleoclimate data compilations is often increased by including data with indirect age estimates that have large uncertainties. By improving age estimates for benthic delta18O alignments and quantifying alignment age uncertainties, this project will allow for more informed selection of which data to include in compilations and overall better accuracy. Data-model comparison performed as part of this project will also better constrain ocean circulation changes, which could help describe the causal chain of events for past climate changes and may identify isolated reservoirs of carbon sequestered in the ocean during glaciations. This project will also provide interdisciplinary training in earth science and mathematics to two graduate students. Research methods and findings will be incorporated into undergraduate and graduate classes through the development and dissemination of interactive computer lab activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Resulting efficiencies can reduce product defects and manufacturing costs by over 25 percent. When coupled with Additive Manufacturing, Smart Manufacturing promises to transform U.S. industry. For example, 20 pounds of raw material are currently required to make a one-pound part for the aerospace industry using subtractive machining. Additive Manufacturing can reduce this so-called buy-to-fly ratio of 20:1 to 2:1, while simultaneously reducing lead time from six months to one week. Realization of these potential manufacturing gains will advance the national prosperity and welfare by increasing U.S. advanced manufacturing competitiveness. Despite these advantages, industries are hesitant to adopt Additive Manufacturing due to process inconsistency - parts may have undetected defects, such as porosity, that make them unsafe for use in mission-critical applications. A potential solution to this problem is a concept called Smart Additive Manufacturing, which melds the ideas of Smart Manufacturing with Additive Manufacturing. Through this Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award, in-process sensor data will be utilized to understand the mechanisms of defect formation occurring during the Laser Powder Bed Fusion Additive Manufacturing process. Advanced data analysis approaches that incorporate the new fundamental understanding of defect evolution will be leveraged to realize a robust correct-as-you-build methodology. This foundational work will find application across many manufacturing sectors including aerospace and defense. The award will also facilitate a discovery-based learning approach to engage learners in hands-on exploration of Additive Manufacturing at multiple levels. A research collaboration with Navajo Technical University will be initiated to further broaden project impact and train the advanced manufacturing workforce of the future. <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to establish a Smart Additive Manufacturing framework for alleviating the poor part quality in the Laser Powder Bed Fusion-based Additive Manufacturing of metals. Success will result in a hybrid Additive Manufacturing strategy that combines material deposition (additive) and material removal (subtractive) actions within the same machine potentially giving rise to zero-defect parts. The research challenges addressed by this award include: 1) understanding how and why certain defects are formed by isolating and quantifying the underlying process phenomena as they happen in real-time using in-process sensors, 2) advancing the mathematics of spectral graph theory to capture defects from heterogeneous sensors in real-time - a big data problem, and  3) forwarding reduced-order models to understand the physical thermomechanical dynamics, such as layer re-melting and reflow, that occur when defects are corrected with hybrid Laser Powder Bed Fusion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An essential part of this effort is determining the sources of trace elements to the oceans.  One important such source comes from seafloor hydrothermal venting. This project will support the measurement of helium isotopes on the 2018 U.S. GEOTRACES expedition in the Pacific Ocean, running south from Alaska to Tahiti. Helium isotopes provide important information on the presence and dispersion of hydrothermal plumes. On a larger scale, they can also be used to calculate global-scale inputs of hydrothermally-sourced trace elements and isotopes. Thus, the proposed work is closely tied to many other projects associated with this expedition.  The measurement of helium isotopes will also allow enable the investigation of physical mixing rates within the upper ocean to help interpret the fate of other trace elements. At the northern end of the section, this approach will also be used to investigate the rate at which other trace elements and isotopes from seafloor hydrothermal venting are delivered to the more biologically productive surface ocean. In addition to supporting the GEOTRACES effort and participating in community-scale outreach efforts associated with the expedition, the investigators will also work with a visual artist to communicate their science to the public in new ways.<br/><br/>The U.S. GEOTRACES Pacific Meridional Transect (56°N to 20°S, along 152°W) in late 2018 will intercept: strong margin fluxes, sub-Arctic high-nutrient, low-chlorophyll waters, the oldest deep waters in the world's oceans, the distal ends of multiple hydrothermal plumes, oxygen minimum zones, subpolar and equatorial upwelling, and, in the South Pacific near 20°S, some of the most oligotrophic waters known. This section, together with the US GEOTRACES East Pacific Zonal Transect (EPZT) conducted in 2013, will also close off a large volume of the Pacific Ocean. Consequently, this work will facilitate new, improved evaluations of regional-scale fluxes of hydrothermally-sourced trace elements and isotopes (TEIs) to the oceans. Because the 2018 expedition will intercept multiple hydrothermal plumes, this project will also allow the investigation of three key questions emerging from the larger U.S. and international GEOTRACES programs: 1) Is there a significant source of hydrothermally-sourced Fe and other TEIs to the euphotic zone in the North Pacific, through upwelling, as was demonstrated for the Southern Ocean from the 2013 EPZT results?  2) How do TEI:He-3 ratios in hydrothermal plumes vary with different geologic settings of their vent-sources?  3) How do the TEI:He-3 ratios imparted to hydrothermal plumes vary along the thermohaline conveyor as a function of varying water column chemistry?  Throughout the section the investigators will also combine upper-water column helium-3 measurements with water column tritium concentrations (extrapolated from data collected on past expeditions) to estimate water column ventilation time scales that can be used to quantify rates of TEI transformation across the wide range of biogeochemical regimes to be intercepted (tropical, subtropical, subpolar).  In regions characterized by upwelling, precise measurements of helium isotopes can be combined with canonical gas-exchange rate estimates to make flux-gauge determinations of upwelling rates for some key TEIs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The commercial impact of the detection system leverages current smartphone capability in concert with advances in imaging, microfluidics, and enhanced computation to deliver detection of multiple important human pathogens all within a portable format.  Further, widespread user experience with smartphone technologies mitigates the need for additional training steps and lowers barriers to adoption.

The intellectual merit of the project stems from the implementation of newly developed particle diffusometry technology, an optical-based method that quantifies the Brownian motion of particles within a fluid. Combining particle diffusometry with nucleic acid-based DNA amplification methods that are standard for point-of-care device industry allows for order of magnitude increases in the sensitivity of pathogen detection. In the presence of pathogens, DNA amplification occurs and causes a decrease in the motion of particles in the sample solution that is imaged by the smartphone camera/external hardware microscope lens system. A smartphone application performs all of the quantitative computation, providing both detection results and immediately logging the data. Data can be readily pushed to the cloud where organizations can track detection events in real-time. Therefore, this I-Corps project will explore the market potential for smartphone-based pathogen detection in remote and low-resource settings and for applications where disease surveillance and monitoring is of great utility.

Any improvements in welding productivity and performance can potentially save billions of dollars for the country. Laser welding is a promising process that can improve the welding speed by tens and even hundreds of times compared with conventional welding processes such as arc welding and electric resistance welding.  However, laser welding can suffer from several problems, including high porosity, coarse grains, and brittle intermetallic compounds in the joints, all of which can reduce performance.

Experimentation and numerical modeling will be used simultaneously to investigate the fundamental physics in V-LKW. The research, if successful, will significantly advance scientific understanding of the complex phenomena in V-LKW, and promote the applications of this novel process in the manufacturing industry (especially the automotive and aerospace sectors) for the improvement of welding productivity and performance.

The success of implanted biomaterials in particular hinges on the behavior of macrophages, the primary cells of the innate immune system that dictate whether a biomaterial will be successfully integrated with the body or will be rejected. Thus, there is a need for a versatile biomaterial modification strategy to precisely control the behavior of infiltrating macrophages for different applications. The protein-ligand binding pair biotin and avidin is known for its exceptional strength. However, it was recently discovered that this binding strength decreases when biotin is attached to larger molecules like proteins and drugs, causing the bond to break and the protein to be released, with resultant effects on the behavior of infiltrating immune cells. The rate of protein release can be tuned over a wide range by modifying preparation parameters, and the selected protein can be chosen to precisely manipulate macrophage behavior, allowing the biomaterials designer to tune the immune system for each intended application. When this system is incorporated into the three-dimensional environment of a biomaterial, the rate that the bond breaks and the protein diffuses from the biomaterial likely depends on the biomaterial environment, including the biomaterial itself and its surrounding milieu, but these phenomena have never been explored. Thus, in this project the effects of biomaterial properties like microstructure and density, and how these properties are changed by the inclusion of the dynamic biotin-avidin-binding system, will be thoroughly characterized, in order to advance fundamental knowledge of the interactions between the binding system and biomaterials. In addition, the effects of the external biomaterial microenvironment will be assessed, including the infiltration of immune cells and blood vessels, an inevitable outcome for all implanted biomaterials. The results of this project will pave the way for the design of biomaterials that can modulate the immune system for biomedical applications, while contributing fundamental understanding of binding interactions in three dimensions with applications in basic biology, biosensors, and nanotechnology.

Thus, there is a need for a versatile biomaterial modification strategy to precisely control the phenotype of infiltrating macrophages for different applications. The goal of this project is to determine how changes in affinity binding interactions and the biomaterial microenvironment affect the release of cytokines from biomaterials to modulate macrophage behavior. The affinity binding pair biotin and avidin will be utilized to identify how dissociation kinetics are altered upon conjugation of biotin to larger molecules like proteins to result in controlled release from biomaterials, a new application of biotin-avidin technology that has never been explored. The effects of bioconjugation parameters like biotin valency and the length of the spacer arm as well as biomaterial properties like crosslinking density and spatial distribution on release of macrophage-modulating cytokines will be determined in vitro. Combination with biomaterials design strategies for spatiotemporal control will be explored, including 3D bioprinting and the sequential release of multiple proteins. Finally, the effects of interactions with the in vivo microenvironment, such as the presence of endogenous biotin, number of infiltrating macrophages, and biomaterial vascularization, on cytokine release will be investigated using a combination of in vitro and in vivo experiments. These results will also contribute preliminary data on how biomaterial-mediated control over macrophage behavior affects biomaterial vascularization.

This study will involve two seagoing expeditions to seismically image the magmatic crust created by the hotspot and obtain critical information about the crust's volume, its composition, how it varies along the island chain, and how the tectonic plate deforms in response to the weight of the volcanoes. In addition to gaining fundamental insight into the formation of the Hawaiian-Emperor chain, the study will also be beneficial to a more comprehensive assessment of geohazards for the Hawaiian island region.

The research cruises will provide excellent opportunities to involve students in data acquisition and analysis, and the results will be the basis for a large public outreach and education effort.<br/><br/>The scientific objectives of the planned data acquisition and analysis of this project are to examine controls on magmatic addition along the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain, provide fundamental constraints on rheological properties of oceanic lithosphere, address the origin of the hotspot swell, and assess implications for earthquakes and tsunamis from plate deformation in response to flexure. The plan is to acquire coincident 2D, deep-penetration seismic reflection data as well as wide-angle reflection/refraction data using ocean bottom seismometers spaced at 15 km along four 500-km-long transects across the Hawaiian-Emperor seamount chain.  The locations of these transects will encompass wide variations in the timing of magma emplacement and volume flux, the age of the lithosphere at the time of loading and the presence/absence of a topographic swell. The transects are sufficiently long to capture the flexural response of the lithosphere to volcano loading out to the flexural bulge. The processed seismic reflection profiles and velocity models created from wide-angle seismic data will constrain the volume and distribution of magmatic addition to the crust as well as faulting within the volcanic edifice and within the loaded oceanic plate. New seismic constraints will be combined with gravity, magnetic, bathymetric and geochemical data and used as the basis for flexural analysis and numerical modeling to gain fundamental new insights into crust and lithosphere dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, egg-tending behaviors can reduce growth of pathogens on eggshells and thereby reduce egg mortality. However, many egg-layers lack parental care and instead leave eggs unattended and exposed to environmental pathogens. The PIs are interested in how such animals prevent egg loss in the absence of parental care, and propose a novel source of protection, protective microbes that passively transfer from the reproductive system of the mother to eggshell surfaces during egg-laying. A collaborative team centering on behavioral ecology and microbiology will examine maternal and eggshell microbiome and their interactions with soil pathogens utilizing lizards as a model system to test the hypothesis that the microbiome affects reproductive success, signaling, and behavioral interactions of lizards. The PIs will mentor undergraduate and high school students in research, especially women and STEM underrepresented minorities. They will provide high-quality interdisciplinary training to the next generation of scientists by involving students in all aspects of their research and by translating their work into class-based projects.  The proposed research has the potential to shed light on the role of the microbiome on animal behavior.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>The interdisciplinary research group will investigate the novel hypothesis that vertically-transmitted cloacal microbes function in egg protection. Preliminary data from Sceloporus virgatus (a phrynosomatid lizard with no parental care) suggest that mature eggs have more bacteria, less fungal growth, and higher hatch success when oviposited than when surgically removed without cloacal contact. The team will: 1) quantify temporal variation in cloacal microbiomes of S. virgatus to test whether females? microbiota change in preparation for egg-laying; 2) use both experiments and observational study to characterize vertical transmission and the role of transmitted microbes in reducing egg infections; 3) relate cloacal microbiota to female reproductive success and signals/cues of reproductive value; and 4) conduct comparative studies across Sceloporus spp. to examine the relationship of reproductive mode (oviparous vs. viviparous) and infection risk on antifungal capacity of cloacal microbiota. Vertical transmission during oviposition is expected to be a general phenomenon, so results should be broadly applicable to other oviparous taxa. The proposed work includes training in sequencing and bioinformatics for the PI, who is based at an undergraduate-serving institution. These methods will be implemented, along with culture-based techniques, in vitro analyses, and field study, in collaboration with carefully mentored undergraduate and high school students. The research will be foundational to the integration of microbiology and behavioral ecology, contributing to long-standing theoretical questions about costs and benefits of parental care (or lack thereof) and sexual signaling, expanding knowledge of microbial diversity and composition in an understudied host lineage, and potentially identifying new antifungal agents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, the manufacturing industry is operating production systems vulnerable to malicious attacks, which may cause produced parts to not meet intended design requirements. Such a deviation from design intent could result in damaged products, loss of customer trust, and potentially injure employees and/or customers. The adoption of the proposed approach will secure manufacturers from cyber-physical attacks and create a strong supply chain. This will allow manufacturers to continue to produce sensitive parts both for the general public and the defense industry, increasing the difficulty of a malicious attack to affect part production. Through successful completion of this program, the I-Corps team will further develop awareness in this area through mentoring graduate students and discussing cyber-physical security with manufacturers across the United States.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project employs both traditional decision analysis and data analysis techniques to identify and detect malicious events within manufacturing systems. This is done through a two-phase approach. First, a cyber-physical vulnerability assessment is completed which highlights areas within the production environment susceptible to malicious attack. Employing decision trees and process mapping, the vulnerability assessment is used to provide a high level overview of the cyber-physical resiliency of a manufacturing facility. Second, the proposed detection approach consists of an air-gapped sensor suite which can be placed on any piece of critical equipment to detect malicious events in real-time. The proposed approach analyzes side-channel measurements independent of the machine such as power consumption, vibration, and sound to identify anomalies within the process. Through performing the vulnerability assessment and implementing the proposed sensor suite, the entire production facility can be secured from malicious cyber-physical attacks intended to reduce part quality and/or sabotage produced parts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia. The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign awards is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on ""OTREC"".<br/><br/>Tropical convection plays a critical role in earth's climate system and is also responsible for extreme precipitation and hurricane formation.  Easterly waves are of particular interest for weather forecasting given their tendency to spawn hurricanes.  More generally, tropical convection is an engine of weather and climate worldwide yet poorly understood and difficult to simulate.  Work leading to better representation of tropical convection in weather and climate models can thus lead to better weather forecasts and impact assessments, both for the public and decision makers.  Aside from the societal relevance of the science, the campaign includes several education and outreach activities including support for undergraduates to participate in fieldwork and production of short documentary videos for use in classroom teaching and informal science education.  In addition, the project builds international scientific collaboration through partnerships with researchers in Costa Rica and Mexico. The project also supports fieldwork participation by three graduate students, and outreach to local students is conducted through short courses at the University of Costa Rica.<br/><br/>The eight week OTREC deployment consists primarily of a set of 20 flights in the Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).  The campaign uses an airport in Costa Rica for easy access to the equatorial Pacific and southwest Caribbean study regions, and conditions in these regions are sampled using dropsondes and a wing-mounted W-band radar.  Dropsondes contain the same instrument package as standard weather balloons, only dropped from an aircraft (in this case from about 40,000 feet) with a small parachute.  The radar determines cloud properties such as the relative abundance of ice particles versus liquid droplets, and uses Doppler shift to measure updraft and downdraft speeds in clouds.  The aircraft sampling is augmented by observations collected at ground sites in Costa Rica and Colombia.<br/><br/>The specific focus of this project is easterly waves, which play a dominant role in the variability of tropical convection and serve as precursors for hurricane formation.  Easterly waves in the southwestern Caribbean are generally thought to propagate into the region from West Africa.  But it is not clear whether easterly waves in the eastern Pacific originate locally or reintensify after crossing Central America from the Caribbean.  Some studies suggest that formation or reintensification occurs through instabilities of strong low-level jets which occur where winds are funneled through gaps in the Central American mountains.  Generation and intensification could also happen through interaction with convection, either over Central America or off the Pacific coast of Colombia, regions where a strong diurnal cycle produces episodes of intense convection and rainfall.<br/><br/>The role of jet stream instabilities in generating or reinvigorating easterly waves is examined using data from meteorological analyses produced using observations from the OTREC campaign (provided by collaborators at ECMWF).  The interaction of easterly waves with convection over Central America is examined using satellite data and surface meteorology stations in Costa Rica. These include GPS receivers already deployed as part of the COCONet network (see EAR-1042906), which record the total precipitable water vapor in the atmosphere.  These assets are augmented with an additional 10 GPS ground stations and 10 surface weather stations, as well as two weather balloon launching stations. A key issue to be examined with the surface stations is the timing of the maxima in precipitable water vapor and precipitation, as the lag between the two (i.e. whether precipitation peaks first or precipitable water peaks first) provides valuable information regarding the organization and vertical structure of convection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As these services scale to billions of users, system operators are increasingly relying on in-memory storage to meet the necessary throughput and latency demands. A major challenge in scaling distributed storage is coping with skewed, dynamic workloads, which can lead to severe load imbalance and performance degradations. While traditional flash-based and disk-based storage can be balanced using a fast in-memory caching layer, server-based caching does not work for in-memory storage, because there is little difference in performance between the caching and storage layers. This project investigates a new distributed storage architecture that leverages the power and flexibility of new generation programmable switches to cache data in the network. The project goal is to not only improve the performance and reliability of cloud systems in practice, but also provide new architectural and theoretical insights on classical distributed systems topics. This project will foster the collaboration between the networking and systems communities in the new area of co-designing networks and systems with programmable switches.<br/><br/>The project will develop a new architecture to provide high aggregate throughput and low latency even under highly-skewed and rapidly-changing workloads. There are two major technical thrusts. The first one is to design the switch cache with limited switch functionalities and resources. The approach will be to exploit the match-action tables, register arrays, and multi-pipeline, multi-stage structure of modern switch designs to efficiently index and pack variable-length objects into limited switch table and memory resources. The second research thrust is to design the overall system to achieve scalability, consistency and fault-tolerance. While these are classical distributed systems topics, they will be revisited in a new type of heterogeneous system which consists of fast switch caches and general-purpose storage servers. A prototype system will be constructed using both programmable software and hardware switches, and extensively evaluated with a wide range of realistic and synthetic workloads.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project combines physics-based modeling of images and shapes, with the versatility of robust optimization and deep learning, to recover 3D shape and semantic information. The work establishes connections between computer vision, machine learning, computer graphics and perception. Vision is a powerful sensing modality since images encode rich information about shape and semantics. However, image formation is a physical phenomenon that often includes complex factors like shape deformations, occlusions, material properties and participating media. Consequently, practical deployment of autonomous or intelligent vision-based systems requires robustness to the effects of diverse physical factors. Such effects may be inverted by modeling the image formation process, but hand-crafted features and hard-coded rules face limitations for data inconsistent with the model. Recent advances in deep learning have led to impressive performances, but generalization of a purely data-driven approach to handle such complex effects is expensive. To address these challenges, this project develops technologies of handling the diversity of real-world images through incorporation of physical models of image formation within deep learning frameworks. The project creates a cross-disciplinary educational program in vision, graphics, learning and perception through coursework that draws connections across wide areas such as physically-based modeling, deep learning, 3D reconstruction and semantic understanding. The program also develops K-12 educative modules that provide experiential insight into novel technologies such as virtual reality or self-driving, with a focus on outreach to students from under-represented backgrounds.<br/><br/>This research lays the foundations for physically-motivated learning of 3D shape and semantics, with benefits such as higher accuracy, better generalization or greater ease of training. It develops theoretical frameworks that relate unknown material behavior to 3D shape, which allows robust optimization frameworks and convolutional neural network architectures for material-invariant shape estimation. It designs novel network structures that model complex transformations, to generalize recovery of shape or semantics across non-rigid and articulated deformations, or distortions due to refraction and participating media. Further, it uses physical models of appearance or motion to bridge the domain gap between simulations and real images, leading to weakly supervised frameworks that mitigate the expense of data annotation. These advances enable novel applications for light field imaging, augmented reality, self-driving in challenging weather, or underwater robotic exploration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a community-led program aiming at providing mentoring to junior women in physical oceanography to improve their retention in the field. The activities carried out as part of the program contribute to the creation of a scientific workforce whose diversity more closely matches that of the student and of the U.S. population. This is achieved by aiding the retention of women in the field of physical oceanography and other geoscience disciplines. The program was initiated in 2004, it was first fully funded by federal agencies in the spring of 2007, and then renewed in 2009. The objectives of the program, as determined by the community in a planning workshop in the fall of 2005, are to: (1) provide continuity of mentoring from a young woman?s graduate career, through her postdoctoral years to the first years of her permanent job, (2) establish a collective responsibility within the physical oceanography community for the mentoring of junior women in the field, (3) provide a variety of mentoring resources and mentors, (4) cast a wide net to avoid exclusiveness, and (5) open this mentoring program to all those who self-identify as a physical oceanographer. Specifically, the following MPOWIR activities will be carried out:<br/>1.Pattullo conference: A biannual conference that brings together about 25 junior women physical oceanographers, and 12 senior physical oceanographers, both male and female, for a 2.5-day meeting focused on discipline-based mentoring.<br/>2.Mentoring groups: Groups of approximately 6 junior women and 2 senior women physical oceanographers meet monthly through a teleconference, for confidential, personalized mentoring.<br/>3.MPOWIR website: The website serves as a repository of resources for mentoring and physical oceanography careers.<br/>4.Databases and surveys: Regular surveys are conducted to assess the effectiveness of MPOWIR activities, determine community mentoring needs, and evaluate progress in retention.<br/>5.Town hall meetings and networking: Events at the Ocean Sciences meeting facilitate networking between physical oceanographers and provide career development information to junior scientists.<br/><br/>The website and town hall meetings are open to all, and great emphasis is placed on making material available via the website, to ensure a gender-neutral benefit. Efforts to export the MPOWIR model to other disciplines and institutions will be undertaken via links with the Earth Science Women's Network, and through a quarterly newsletter. Social media will be used to publicize MPOWIR activities, announcement and events.

These inhabitants were long invisible to scientists studying plants, but with the advancement of DNA-based assessment tools, researchers have discovered an increasing diversity of organisms that reside inside healthy plants. Endophytes include hundreds of microbial species (bacteria and fungi) that live in healthy wood inside standing trees. Some provide benefits to the host tree, but others, particularly fungi, may attack and/or weaken trees (pathogens) or may try to get a head start decomposing wood (saprotrophs). In addition, there are many microbes present as endophytes with functions that have yet to be determined. Determining these functions is a critical need for predicting the risk of tree hazards, and for modeling rates of decomposition and carbon released once a tree dies. Accurately predicting wood decay is difficult and presents a significant uncertainty in carbon cycle models. To improve predictive power, it is necessary to model a key transition that occurs when a tree dies a natural death, killing many endophytes but exposing a payoff to others that rise to dominate these subsequent microbial communities, particularly saprotrophs. This research makes use of a natural disturbance event, the great deal of tree damage created by Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, to study how endophytes shape the fungal decomposition communities that develop post-disturbance. With this knowledge, it is possible not only to improve decomposition models but also better predict endophyte success, an asset for predicting tree hazard risks in future hurricanes. The project also offers opportunities for STEM training of several female team members, including Puerto Rican collaborators affected by Hurricane Maria. It will also lead to production of a public video describing the science, the scientists, and the role of endophytes in tree hazards and decomposition processes in nature.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are to track the development of tree endophyte fungi post-hurricane in Puerto Rico's Guanica Forest scientific area, and to correlate this process with environmental variables and wood traits (e.g. nitrogen content). There are three specific objectives to reach this goal, 1) rapid-response sampling to assess fungal communities present at time zero, 2) tracking communities at two additional time points to assess persistence of endophytes, and 3) matching outcomes over one year to site climate data (temperature, rainfall) and to wood substrate physiochemistry. This study includes wood sections from 14 tree species, either cut and left in ground contact to decay along a transect or remaining standing as a stump section. A key hypothesis is that endophyte saprotrophs will have a greater influence on decomposition in standing sections rather than in ground contact, but that the overall rates of decomposition will be influenced by climate and wood physiochemical variables, particularly wood nitrogen and heartwood content. The study design allows coupling of community structure and function with host traits over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The long-term goal of this public investment of money and trust is to improve our nation's health, economy, and social policies. In order to determine which researchers and projects will receive funding, grant agencies employ a process of peer review in which expert researchers evaluate the merits of submitted proposals. This longstanding social technology -- of relying on expert evaluation to inform determinations of merit -- empowers grant agencies to make funding decisions based on a fuller understanding of the social and scientific excellence of each project. As such, it is critical for grant agencies to employ rigorous and fair peer review processes in order to recruit, retain, and fund the best minds. This project builds on a growing scientific literature that studies how grant peer review works with an eye towards identifying ways of improving its effectiveness. More specifically, grant proposal review procedures commonly require reviewers to score applications along multiple dimensions -- for example, a proposal's approach, innovation, versus significance -- as an intermediate step in determining the proposal's overall score. When procedures are left unspecified for how reviewers should combine individual scores (along multiple dimensions) into overall scores, evaluators might arrive at overall scores in ways that subtly advantage and disadvantage grant proposals submitted by applicants from different social groups. Any such difference is what we call commensuration bias. This research identifies and evaluates approaches for measuring commensuration bias by analyzing peer review data from applications submitted to an ongoing intramural collaborative biomedical research program that utilized the independent peer review services of the American Institute of Biological Sciences. This project aims to offer concrete, efficient policies that ensure fair review for any grant agency that requires scoring of applications along multiple criteria, including the National Institutes of Health, which is the world's largest public funder of biomedical research in the world.<br/><br/>There is currently no established methodology for detecting commensuration bias. The availability of criteria and overall scores from individual reviewers makes it possible to examine how individual reviewers evaluate multiple criteria simultaneously and how they unconsciously combine criteria scores to arrive at overall scores. In addition to hierarchical linear models that assume overall application score is an additive function of criteria scores, this study uses Bayesian regression trees to model non-linear decision processes and multivariate analyses to model the distribution of criteria scores. This range of statistical approaches allows this study to avoid making strong assumptions about the nature of commensuration and provides tools needed to inform two main types of potential policy recommendations: (a) those that focus on the restructuring or modification of programmatic review procedures as a whole and (b) those that focus on the monitoring of unusual peer review scores.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Comparative archaeological analyses of complex societies have demonstrated that there is a high degree of variability in the expression of such complexity, as well as in the processes that led to its emergence around the world. Within this broader context, this study focuses on household economy in order to gain insight about the sources of political and economic power, and reveal other forms of organization that may differ from top-down norms. The results will inform about social and political complexity, domestic and community economy, and occupational differentiation. This project represents an opportunity to collaborate with Costa Rican heritage authorities and the National Parks system to promote public outreach, education, and conservation of cultural heritage. Student participants will receive mentorship, training, and experience in archaeological theories and field and laboratory methods. The project will integrate Latina women as field supervisors and crew in order to broaden their participation as an underrepresented group in science. The results of the project will be shared globally as well as with local communities and National Parks officials through workshops, talks and field visits. <br/><br/>University at Albany-SUNY doctoral student, Yajaira Núñez-Cortés, supervised by Dr. Robert Rosenswig, will investigate how the development of economic and political power had an effect on household economies from all segments of the social hierarchy. During AD 800-1500, the appearance of monumental centers in Costa Rica indicates a reorganization of social, political and economic relationships. Such changes coincide with an amplification of interregional exchange and chiefly interaction for Central Costa Rican polities. These large-scale developments are best measured by their impacts in all levels of society, but especially by their impact on the smallest and remote residential units. This study will evaluate previously held assumptions about the relationship between elite power and control of resources and valuable objects by studying household economic differentiation, activity organization, and access to exchange networks at Lomas Entierros site. The researchers will analyze domestic assemblages in combination with house architecture in order to characterize manifestations of wealth, power, and material culture usage. Data from house structures located in the main core of the site and humbler edifices on its periphery will provide contrastive examples from higher and lower social status contexts. This project also incorporates LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) data to understand the settlement system and spatial organization of the site. The results will contribute to the debate about sources of political and economic power and will inform anthropological models on political and household organization in the ancient past.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this funded project is to determine the mechanisms responsible for oceanographic and environmental changes associated with the most severe mass extinction in the Silurian. This project will utilize both newly developed and well-established geochemical approaches to develop a detailed history of oxygen levels in the oceans during this time interval. It is important to understand the history of oxygen concentrations in ancient oceans because changes in oxygen levels impact marine life, critical biogeochemical processes in the oceans and atmosphere, and the formation and preservation of economic hydrocarbon and mineral deposits. The project will provide meaningful hands-on field and laboratory experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, support the training of underrepresented groups in the geosciences, and support a high school science teacher to conduct cutting-edge research, which will provide motivation for new activities in their own classrooms. <br/><br/>The project will address three research objectives: construct high-resolution isotopic analyses of sulfur and carbon, along with a suite of redox proxies (Fe-speciation, trace metal concentrations, thallium isotopes, I/Ca ratios), and detailed sedimentary facies analyses through late Silurian strata from multiple ocean basins on three separate paleocontinents. This will allow the research team to directly test existing hypotheses related to the causes of this late Silurian mass extinction event and associated large positive 13C excursion. Second, new high-resolution sedimentary geochemical data will be integrated with known paleobiological records via numerical stratigraphic methods (CONOP) for constraining possible causative connections between carbon cycle perturbation, marine extinction event, and eustatic sea-level records. Third, geochemical modeling will be used to further evaluate hypotheses regarding the links of local environmental changes, biotic extinction and recovery, and fluctuating global redox conditions in the oceans during the late Silurian.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This means they are often thought of as being liquid water, also called warm clouds, or ice, also called cold clouds. Those clouds that contain liquid water droplets and ice crystals at the same time are called mixed phase clouds. Mixed phase clouds are currently poorly understood because of the complicated mixture. Our lack of understanding of clouds, particularly those that are mixed in phase, limits our ability to understand precipitation, the atmosphere chemistry and climate. This project will determine the particles on which the droplets and ice crystals in mixed phase clouds form by deploying a new inlet and both warm and cold cloud chambers at Storm Peak Laboratory. Storm Peak is a high altitude site located in the Rocky Mountains in north-central Colorado that is among only a handful of sites worldwide that offers scientific laboratories where mixed phase clouds exist for long time periods. Using this new inlet, the research team will carry out two-season long observational studies of droplet and ice crystals within mixed phase clouds. This project will allow a resolution of the question of which atmospheric particles make droplets, which make ice crystals, and which do not effectively make either.<br/><br/>A graduate student will work on this project full time, thereby being trained in this important area of atmospheric science. A post-doctoral fellow will also work on this project part-time, increasing their research experience in this area. The collected data will be archived and presented to the atmospheric sciences community. This will include both papers and presentations, with a focus on providing data to help improve models that include precipitation, climate and air quality. Beyond the scientific community, a documentary of the project at Storm Peak will be made in partnership with Science for the Public, a WGBH-Boston television and multimedia production.

The team has developed a nitinol-based foot orthoses. Compared to the current foot orthoses that are made of nonmetallic materials, the nitinol-based foot orthoses can provide enhanced functional capabilities including optimized energy dissipation capacity, improved comfort, long functional life, and lightweight. The life expectancy of the nitinol orthoses is twice as long as that of the plastic orthoses. The foot orthotic insoles market is currently estimated to be worth $2.6B and will grow to $3.7B by 2021. Thus, commercialization and application of the proposed foot orthoses will greatly impact the footwear industry. This project is the beginning of a new science and technology based company that will enhance the technology infrastructure and upon completion provide jobs for the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce of the state of Mississippi.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the market potential of the novel foot orthoses previously developed by the team. The foot orthoses are made of nitinol using additive manufacturing methods. Their cellular structure generated during the additive manufacturing process can absorb more shock energy from every step a customer takes, therefore offering adjustable cushioning and comfort to the customer. Due to the shape-memory property and superelasticity of nitinol, the designed foot orthoses are easier to deflect under human body-support interaction forces, and can withstand corrosive environments and fatigue loading conditions. This I-Corps project aims to evaluate the market opportunities of the developed foot orthoses to gain a clear identification of market of the technology, as well as a deeper insight into the needs of potential customers.

The ultimate goal of SEDI is an enhanced understanding of the past evolution and current thermal, chemical and dynamical state of the Earth's deep interior and of the effect of that the interior has on structures and processes observed at the surface of the Earth. The ""deep interior"" is generally considered to be the core and lower mantle, but interest often extends to the surface, for example, in the study of mantle plumes or dynamics of descending lithospheric slabs. The scientific questions and problems of interest to SEDI include the geomagnetic dynamo and secular variation, paleomagnetism and the evolution of the Earth's deep interior, material properties at extreme conditions, structure and dynamics of the core and mantle, core-mantle interactions, and the nature and location of deep geochemical reservoirs. <br/><br/>This workshop will contribute to interdisciplinary education of US graduate students and beginning researchers by fostering dialog with researchers at all levels at a relatively small workshop-style meeting. The international format complements efforts by US national groups such as CIDER and will be useful to those funded under or seeking funding from the NSF CSEDI program.

One aspect of biodiversity that directly impacts human health is its importance in mitigating risk of disease transmission from wildlife.  A prominent theory in ecology is that greater diversity of species reduces the risk of disease transmission, through an effect called dilution. Evidence for the dilution effect has been found in several disease systems, including Lyme disease.  Greater species diversity of small mammals that serve as hosts for Lyme disease result in less transmission of the disease.  However, even in this well-studied system, there is little research on the importance of genetic variation within the Lyme disease pathogen. This project focuses on the Lyme disease system, to address a critical question in disease ecology: how does species diversity of hosts influence pathogen genetic diversity and what does the culmination of these interactions mean for disease risk? This project also will provide research training to undergraduate and graduate students, will develop active learning focused courses on disease ecology, and will engage the public in tick-borne disease biology through citizen science opportunities.

Changes in atmospheric water vapor and clouds due to changes in the hydrological cycle also alter the surface-atmosphere exchanges via changes in absorption and reflection of the incoming solar energy and in emission of infrared radiation. Changes in the amount of rainfall and the frequency of heavy rain events have been observed over the last century. These changes are, in part, a result of human emission of greenhouse gases.  Increasing levels of carbon dioxide, aerosols, and other greenhouse gases causes warming of the surface and atmosphere, which in turns leads to more evaporation from (ocean) surfaces and increases of the amount of moisture and clouds in the atmosphere, as well as more rainfall. The extra heat transferred away from the surface associated with the strengthening of hydrological cycle warms the atmosphere further. This together with the stronger greenhouse effect due to more moisture in the atmosphere leads to a stronger emission of infrared radiation to the surface, which compensates the surface warming reduction due to stronger evaporation.  These changes can occur on both slow (years to decades) and fast (days to months) timescales. It is these changes in the flow of energy, not the increase in moisture, that causes rainfall to increase globally in response to increasing greenhouse gases. Thus, in order to fully understand and predict future changes in rainfall requires a better understanding how the transfer of energy between the surface and atmosphere will change in a warmer climate. <br/><br/>This research uses an innovative method of computing the effects of an increase in greenhouse gases and aerosols, and a warmer and more humid climate, on the flow of energy between the surface and atmosphere. Through this new method, termed radiative kernels, the individual contributions of different processes can be isolated and their contributions to the changes in precipitation quantified. In doing so, this research will provide a better understanding of the physical mechanisms that underlie model projections of future precipitation change. In particular, this research strives to better understand the cause of disparities between different model projections of rainfall change and use this information to improve models and ultimately provide more reliable projections of future changes.<br/><br/>Because of the role of rainfall in determining the availability of fresh water and agricultural food production, changes in its amount, distribution or intensity have significant impacts on people and the environment. In addition, changes in the occurrence of heavy rainfall events alters the frequency of floods, which cause damage to infrastructure, loss of property, and loss of life. Predicting future changes in rainfall that stem from changes in climate therefore represents a key scientific challenge with important societal benefits. The knowledge gained from this research will ultimately lead to both a better understanding of the underlying physical processes that govern rainfall change and improved predictions of future rainfall change. By increasing the reliability of long term projections of changes in rainfall, this project will help decision makers plan for adequate adaptation and mitigation strategies that, in turn, lessen the cost and consequences of future changes in climate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An emerging technology, electromyography (EMG)-based Neural Machine Interface (NMI), offers enormous potential in the restoration of function through neuroprosthetics for this population, including amputees, stroke survivors, and cerebral palsy patients. The technology senses bioelectrical signals from muscles, interprets them to identify the intended movement of the patient, and makes decisions to control neurorehabilitation applications (e.g., a prosthetic limb). While neurorehabilitation system design has progressed remarkably over several decades, no system is currently capable of meeting all desired technical specifications for commercial and clinical implementation. This project takes a computer engineering approach toward improving EMG-based NMI technology functionality and robustness. Software will be developed for managing the sensor status and real-time responses, and novel computing platforms will be implemented to handle the large-scale, data-intensive computations required for responsive neurorehabilitation applications. The project integrates research and education through several avenues: enhancement of undergraduate curricula with embedded research experiences, development of a massive open online course on neural machine interface, and initiation of a K-12 through community college outreach program. <br/><br/>The PI's long-term career goal is to develop next-generation NMIs that will connect people and enable the exploration of big data and deep learning technologies in neurorehabilitation research. Toward this goal, the project's objectives are to (1) develop new hardware and software methods to enable the use of high-density grid sensing technology in real-time EMG-based NMIs to improve the functionality and robustness of the NMIs and (2) develop new computing technologies so that computing power and storage capacity are no longer barriers to the advancement of NMI neurorehabilitation research. The PI will first address the challenge of applying high-density EMG grids to real-time NMIs by employing a Grid Status Awareness and Response Engine to closely monitor the status of the EMD grids and respond accordingly. The issue of computational burden posed by the high-density EMG grids will then be tackled through the development of a neuromorphic computing system. Finally, a hierarchical computing platform that provides sufficient computational and storage capabilities to enable real-time response and portability will be developed. Insights and advancements made here in EMG-based NMI design will markedly improve reliability and functionality of EMG-controlled neurorehabilitation systems. Additionally, the developed NMI methods and tools are applicable to research fields beyond neurorehabilitation applications, such as brain-computer interfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Limitations imposed by silicon (Si) power semiconductor devices make it challenging to achieve the desired power density, efficiency, and reliability for future traction and propulsion drives. Fortunately, emerging silicon carbide (SiC) power devices enable a pathway to develop the next-generation motor drives. However, control practices must evolve from the existing approaches for Si-based motor drives to take advantages of SiC power devices. Innovations are also desired to address challenges related to the electromagnetic interference (EMI) issues due to the inherently faster switching of SiC devices, and the thermal management for higher heat fluxes. On the practical side, the research and development of high-power propulsion drives is hampered by the lack of testing facilities at a full power scale. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will develop and demonstrate a novel dual-core control concept comprising an electro-magnetic-thermal co-optimization framework for the next generation SiC motor drives. The proposed research plan will lead to an innovative solution overcoming the limitations of present control practices, and thus having the potential to transform the existing ways to model, monitor, and control the SiC motor drives. The research will be seamlessly integrated with several undergraduate and graduate courses as well as K-12 outreach activities at National Center for Reliable Electric Power Transmission (NCREPT) at the University of Arkansas. The main objective is to utilize research as a driving force to build a thriving and diversified power electronics program, and to inspire young individuals to pursue STEM careers. Thus, there will be various opportunities for student involvement in the research program, both in and out of the classroom, to develop a complete set of skills required in the power electronic profession.  <br/>The research goal of this project is to develop a dual-core control framework to co-optimize the electro-magnetic-thermal tradeoffs for the SiC motor drives. Control and optimization functions related to the performance of the motor and inverter will be implemented in two control cores. Critical information will be exchanged between the control cores to achieve the co-optimization objectives. More specifically, the research thrusts will include: 1) developing a novel model-based current ripple prediction approach and investigate ripple-based switching sequence optimization to mitigate EMI and reduce switching losses; 2) developing a reliable real-time junction temperature monitoring approach for SiC power modules and a new active thermal management method; 3) investigating a novel mixed-timescale modeling for the proposed dual-core control that also enables a new tool to study the stability of a power electronic system; and 4) revamping the megawatt-class NCREPT testing facility to develop a unique testbed for experimental studies at propulsion power levels. As an electro-magnetic-thermal co-optimization framework, the proposed dual-core control will disrupt today's model-based motor controller design practice. It will advance our understanding on the integration of real-time multi-objective optimization into motor drive controllers. It will also create a paradigm shift to address EMI mitigation and thermal management from the root causes, which are significantly different from the use of EMI filters and heat sinks that address only symptoms. In summary, this project will contribute to the theories and applications of optimal control, state estimation, variable switching frequency modulation, and thermal management in several aspects. Very importantly, the outcome of this research will benefit various sectors of the nation's economy because motor drive systems lie at the heart of a wide variety of industrial applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Major droughts and floods will occur more often and will be more intense. These changes are likely to have a large impact on grasslands and the ecosystem services they provide. Scientists have studied grassland ecosystems and the plant species that live in them for many years. Predicting the future of grasslands as the environment changes remains a challenge, however, because it is very difficult to understand causes of patterns using observations alone. Controlled experiments can uncover what causes changes in grasslands with enough confidence to predict their future as they begin to experience conditions never seen before. It is also difficult to predict long-term changes using only short-term experiments. This project will expand on decade-long field experiments in which rainfall amount and variability were manipulated to learn how grassland ecosystems are likely to change. Results from these experiments will yield new understanding that will provide guidance to managers of drylands in the Southwest United States, and around the world. This project will also train a new generation of scientists, many of whom are members of underrepresented minority groups.<br/><br/>This project is guided by two hypotheses about endogenous and exogenous phenomena that interact with each other to generate dryland responses to changes in amount and variability of precipitation. (1) Endogenous biogeochemical and demographic phenomena mediate abrupt or continuous changes in populations, communities and ecosystem processes. (2) Exogenous phenomena, such as El Niño events that occur with low frequency, interact with endogenous mechanisms to affect system resilience, leading to changes in population dynamics and ecosystem processes. This project will capture the impacts of infrequent exogenous phenomena and the cumulative effects of endogenous factors on populations of desert species, communities and ecosystems. The project will build upon two extant experiments located in a Desert Grassland in New Mexico: (a) manipulation of rainfall amount (80% reduced precipitation, ambient, 80% increased) crossed with changes in nitrogen availability, and (b) manipulation of rainfall variability (control, enhanced variability by 50% and 80%). Long-term manipulations of precipitation amount are accomplished using rainout shelters coupled with irrigation systems. Different levels of nitrogen availability are achieved via fertilization.  Manipulations of precipitation variability are conducted by flipping drought and irrigation treatments from year to year in the same plots. Response variables include above and belowground net primary production, species composition, net nitrogen mineralization and leaf nitrogen isotopic ratios. This research has the potential to transform understanding of long-term ecosystem responses to changes in patterns of precipitation, which is critical to assessment of how ecosystem services are likely to change over the coming decades.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, such datasets are typically archived in inaccessible repositories and may be poorly described and difficult to use by others. Current manufacturing research must shift from siloed repositories of product manufacturing data to a federated, decentralized, open and inter-operable approach. This transformation can be achieved by embedding cyber-capability in every physical end-point, be it on a desktop used by a product designer or within the control systems of a manufacturing machine. The goal of this project is to develop a pilot manufacturing-focused cyberinfrastructure called FabWave. FabWave will gather together digital data on product and manufacturing processes from diverse sources, in particular, three-dimensional (3D) computer aided design (CAD) models generated by academia and public community users, into a new rich dataset that, in turn, will be fully accessible to manufacturing researchers and others. FabWave's system design will be driven by the needs of the manufacturing research community, and the project will encourage its adoption by academic users, government labs and the public. FabWave will aim to lower the barriers for users to upload, share and download 3D product model data; it will also enable manufacturing science researchers to gain access to an information rich dataset for testing and evaluation of algorithms to advance manufacturing research and offer the capability for the community to build custom apps that provide services to the community. This infrastructure development project aligns with the NSF Harnessing Data for 21st Century Science and Engineering Big Ideas vision and can serve to improve US competitiveness in advanced manufacturing.<br/><br/>The de novo cyberinfrastructure tools to be built in the FabWave project include: 1) Direct plugins within design software to allow easier capture of metadata and upload of 3D product models to the FabWave repository with limited human interaction; 2) a data-store with application programming interface (API) tools to allow users to write scripts to search through the repository for content specific to their research questions. Innovative use of the Inter-Planetary File System (IPFS) protocols along with next generation unstructured databases will serve to index and enable search services for Fabwave's users. the project will demonstrate use of FabWave for development of community facing third-party apps and libraries. Ultimately, the research community will have access to a rich source of product datasets created within research laboratories, within classes and through other open sourced projects. This data network, if expanded across universities, would accelerate advancements in cybermanufacturing, engineering systems design, and cyber-physical systems in manufacturing. In addition, FabWave will enable new areas of research in manufacturing information integration and informatics combined with reducing the barriers to exploring the science of manufacturing machine intelligence.

This unparalleled fossil assemblage allows rigorous studies of extinct mammal biology, especially of carnivores which are rare at most fossil sites. The La Brea fossils span a critical time in Earth's history (approximately 50,000 years ago to the present) that includes major events such as the end of the last Ice Age, the arrival of humans in North America, and an extinction that killed two thirds of the large mammals on the continent. This unique deposit will be used to investigate relationships between major environmental changes and evolutionary variation (size, diet, etc.) in large mammals, information that is critical for promoting the survival of wildlife today. The project involves significant community outreach in the greater Los Angeles area through the Tar Pits Museum and will create educational content that will be available online for high school teachers across the country.<br/><br/>	The major impediment to system-level study at Rancho La Brea is a paucity of radiocarbon dates and the resulting inability to correlate biotic change with time. This project will intensively radiocarbon date samples from multiple pits spanning the last 50,000 years to establish the first detailed chronology for the entrapment of four extinct species of large mammals, and one extant species. It will involve the collection and compilation of census data for these species to track changes in total abundance and diversity, as well as data on morphological and dietary changes. A well-resolved chronology will allow these data on evolutionary changes in mammals and the Pleistocene megafaunal extinctions to be linked to existing records of major paleo-environmental changes.

No other group of animals has such diverse forelimbs, and the flexibility of mammal forelimbs seems to be a key reason for the group's success. The first mammal relatives found in the fossil record are over 300 million years old, and are a striking contrast to living mammals: their forelimbs show a very limited range of shapes and functions. How did the evolutionarily-flexible forelimbs of mammals evolve from such seemingly constrained ancestors, and did changes to the forelimb increase the ability of mammals to explore new ways of life? This research project will use state-of-the-art techniques, and extensive data from fossils and modern animals, to reconstruct forelimb structure and function in ancient mammal relatives, and to test whether changes to the forelimb correlate with increases in their ecological diversity. The results will deepen our understanding of the evolution of a quintessential characteristic of mammals, and its role in the evolution of animals as distinct as bats, moles, whales, horses, and humans. Dissemination of the research will occur through a series of educational online videos produced by the award-winning YouTube Channel ""The Brain Scoop"". The series will include three episodes describing different stages of the research, and two episodes that describe the results and their significance. Audience responses to the videos will be used to evaluate the effectiveness of online videos as a tool for science education.<br/><br/>Modern mammals display remarkable ecomorphological diversity, which is underpinned by exaptation of the forelimb to serve novel functions (e.g. flying, running, swimming, and digging). In contrast, the ancestors of mammals - the non-mammalian synapsids - are generalized terrestrial tetrapods with seemingly limited ecological scope. The mammalian-style forelimb, including a fully mobile scapula, ventrally oriented ball-and-socket shoulder joint, and ""upright"" limb posture and movement, is the result of a profound reorganization of the ancestral synapsid musculoskeletal system. Drawing from the extensive synapsid fossil record, this project integrates a diverse set of methodological techniques to pinpoint how morphofunctional transformation of the forelimb influenced the tempo and mode of phenotypic evolution of the synapsid clade. Rigorous morphometric analyses will quantify shape disparity in forelimb skeletal elements and identify major shifts in morphology. Cutting-edge biomechanical analyses will correlate morphological shifts with functional transformation. And, advanced phylogenetic modeling techniques will determine whether shifts in morphology and function resulted in increases in diversification rates. Key products include a new comprehensive metatree of Synapsida, an extensive geometric morphometric dataset, and 3D musculoskeletal models of ten taxa at phylogenetically informative stages of synapsid evolution. Combined, this project will build a robust comparative framework to quantify musculoskeletal transformations in extinct animals and provide a unique evolutionary perspective on an integrated anatomical module of significant adaptive value.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much like any system of resource extraction (e.g. oil and natural gas, minerals, precious gems) there is the opportunity for accumulating great wealth and power by controlling the production, distribution, and consumption of a highly sought after raw material. Obsidian, a widely used volcanic glass, was the principal material used for all cutting, scraping, and piercing tools for over three millennia throughout pre-Hispanic central Mexico. However, previous archaeological studies into obsidian political economies have focused on the systems of obsidian distribution and consumption, due to the types of sites investigated, ignoring the initial systems of extraction and production. As a result, the means by which resource distribution networks develop and how commodity production is connected to consuming populations is poorly understood. Likewise, the details of how economically and political centralized polities might gain from their control over such resources and the nature of that control have not been vigorously researched. Since raw material quarrying was common throughout the ancient world, the questions addressed in this study have universal applicability, while the methodology can be replicable across the globe in similar contexts.<br/><br/>Dr. Knight and his research team will examine whether obsidian extraction was the result of centralized control by a regional polity, or organized by local populations asserting their territorial rights to the land. Obsidian from the Zaragoza-Oyameles source in eastern Puebla, Mexico dominates chipped stone assemblages at sites throughout much of south eastern Mexico from ca. 400 B.C. to A.D. 1000, and is found in lesser amounts well beyond this region. The ancient, regional center of Cantona may have had its economic clout underwritten by its control over this obsidian source. However, the nature of that control has never been investigated or even modeled. The data collected by Knight and his team of archaeologists, osteologists and faunal experts from broad-scaled excavations at the Zaragoza-Oyameles obsidian quarries and associated habitation sites, will directly address the assumption of political and economic control. Utilizing the strengths of several disciplines, they will reconstruct who and how many were involved in obsidian extraction, the methods used to quarry the material, what types of tools were produced and in what quantity, and the nature and degree to which obsidian extraction and production benefited local inhabitants, as opposed to, and/or in addition to the Cantona elite. Since archaeological investigations of quarries are relatively rare, the interdisciplinary approaches developed here can be used universally as a template for future research and student training.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is partly due to our limited understanding of the physical processes that relate the mechanics of touching an object to perception and movement.  Recent research has shown that even lightly touching an object with a finger often excites elastic waves that travel throughout the hand and elicit responses in the sensory nervous system that evoke the conscious experience of touch contact in the brain, but the biomechanics that mediate this process are as yet unclear.  The goals of this project are to elucidate aspects of the sense of touch that are affected by mechanical waves propagating in the body, to investigate the range of tactile sensations that accompany natural interactions with the hands, and to design new hardware technologies and algorithms for providing touch feedback in virtual reality.  The work will quantitatively explore mechanisms of touch elicited wave propagation in order to catalyze advances in technologies for haptic sensing and feedback.  Project outcomes will have broad impact by establishing a unique approach to teaching concepts from engineering and neuroscience to students at all levels, by using the sense of touch as a focal point and arena for creative hands-on learning, by enabling science outreach to the public through a radio show hosted by the PI, and by contributing to new technologies for aiding individuals with complex sensory impairments affecting the sense of touch.<br/><br/>This project unites theoretical and empirical studies of touch-related viscoelastic waves with the engineering of new technologies for haptic sensing and display.  To elucidate the mechanisms of human touch sensing and to realize technologies that can accurately address the haptic sense, a quantitative account of the mechanical signals involved is needed.  Building on recent findings about touch-related elastic wave propagation in the hand, the viscoelastic waves produced during touch interactions with objects and surfaces, and the information they carry, will be measured and analyzed in order to: (1) Reveal the mechanics and information content of contact-elicited waves; (2) Create sensing methods that will be used to characterize tactile information in real world environments; and (3) Design haptic display technologies and rendering techniques to provide evocative haptic effects to the hand.  The research will address a major gap in our understanding of tactile function by clarifying the biomechanical processes that link remote touch contact to neural processing and conscious perception.

These observations have started to revolutionize our understanding of many areas in physics, including the origins of the heavy elements, like silver, gold, and platinum. However, they also pose many pressing open questions.  This project will make use of the Blue Waters supercomputer to address these open questions.  State-of-the-art NS merger simulations will be performed on the Blue Waters supercomputer to examine all the different possible NS collision scenarios to understand the fundamental physical processes that generated the observation data. This will be followed by extremely high-resolution simulations considering the post-merger evolution.  Simulation results will be made publicly available, and dissemination via movies, public lectures and school visits are planned.<br/><br/>A systematic study of the evolution of NS binary systems compatible with the observed NS collision, GW170817, will be performed by means of merger simulations on Blue Waters, employing sophisticated microphysics and neutrino treatment.  These simulations will ascertain the viability of tidal torques and shocks as mechanisms for the ejection of matter during mergers, which in turn powers the observed optical and infrared transients and synthesizes heavy elements. The impact of the NS equation of state (EOS) will be evaluated by considering a set of 3 EOSs spanning the range of the current nuclear uncertainties. The range of possible outcomes of the merger as a function of the binary parameters and EOSs will be assessed. High-resolution general-relativistic magnetohydrodynamics simulations of the merger remnant will be performed, with sufficient resolution to determine the magnetorotational instability (MRI) and the angular-momentum redistribution in the remnant while employing a microphysical treatment of the NS matter. These simulation results will ascertain the role of magnetohydrodynamics processes in determining the lifetime of the remnant and the observational signatures of an early or delayed black-hole formation. The role played by magnetized winds in the powering of the optical and infrared emissions and their nucleosynthetic yields will be assessed.   In addition, this project will develop significant improvements to current open-source codes, and all improvements will be released to the community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims to place new teachers into rural high schools in Western Kansas, thus increasing the workforce for secondary STEM education. To accomplish this goal, the project will provide students with scholarships and develop curriculum materials to prepare them to be successful teachers in high needs, rural classrooms with high percentages of students eligible for free and reduced lunches (a poverty indicator). A key element of the curriculum will be a rural field experience planned in cooperation with the school districts through a regional service center, coupled with academic year seminars. The project will use a mentoring program for undergraduates and a professional development program for early teachers that will support both future and practicing teachers. Rural areas in Kansas have a critical shortage of STEM teachers. By supporting the pipeline of students from community college, through teacher certification, and placement into high-need rural areas of Western Kansas, this project will contribute to STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>The project aims to recruit 33 undergraduates from five local community colleges (Dodge City, Garden City, Barton County, Colby, and Seward Community Colleges) to Fort Hays State University, where they will double major in secondary education and a STEM discipline.  The project will also collaborate with the Southwest Plains Regional Service Center, which serves 34 rural school districts in Western Kansas. The service center will provide scholarship recipients with early experiences in rural schools and assist with student teaching placements.  The project will provide scholarships and support activities to students through their undergraduate and post-baccalaureate year, intended to enable the students to become certified STEM teachers.  The project focuses on research questions including: What recruiting practices for attracting STEM teachers to FHSU are most effective? What recruiting strategies attract more STEM teachers? What factors result in retaining STEM teachers once they enter the profession in a high needs rural area? What factors negatively impact retention in rural areas?

It supports computational research and education that includes developing computer simulation tools and applying them to advance understanding of battery electrode material performance. Material failures are serious roadblocks to the development of high performance energy storage materials, which are vital to many applications, such as electric cars and delivering renewable energy. The PI aims to use computers to simulate the chemistry and mechanics of candidate electrode materials in a lithium-ion battery. The PI will investigate proposed high-performance electrode materials, particularly one made of copper coated silicon on a scaffold made of carbon. The simulations will show how charging and discharging cycles affect the failure of the electrode material. The research activities will not only advance the scientific knowledge on the material structure changes and the dynamics of lithium ions of silicon-based electrode composites, but also will provide a Mutliscale Modeling Toolbox that describes physics and chemistry that spans from processes on the scale of atoms to macroscopic scales. The computational toolbox can be extended to systems beyond silicon and lithium technology such as newly developed magnesium and lithium air batteries. This approach has impact on enhancing the performance of energy storage materials. This project also supports educational activities that will employ the latest methods of emerging media to recruit and retain underrepresented students and women to engineering through professional programs at Rice University, and provide outreach to local high school teachers in Houston to help enrich the science content and to introduce pedagogical methods with lesson plans to nurture future generations.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award is a collaboration between the Division of Materials Research and the Division of Civil, Mechanical, and Manufacturing Innovation. It supports computational research and education to develop a reactive molecular-dynamics-based multiscale simulation framework that enables the application of fundamental material science to tackle the pressing global needs for high performance energy storage materials. These needs include high capacity, rate, and cycle life rechargeable batteries. The overarching goal is to study how the intrinsic coupling between mechanics and electrochemistry during cycling impact the failure and performance of silicon-based electrode composites of lithium-ion batteries. Copper coated silicon deposited onto a 3D carbon scaffold will be a focus of this modeling effort. A novel computational protocol will be developed to enable understanding of the synergistic behavior of material characteristics and atomistic processes across multiple length scales and how it affects the performance of silicon-based electrodes. The proposed electrode composite will provide a 3D template, which exhibits improved service life and performance as well as lightweight and multifunctional features. The key hypotheses of this project are: 1) there exists two or more phase boundaries in the composite silicon electrodes that co-evolve, influence each other, and trigger defects and mismatched strains, and 2) a memory effect in the topology of the active material controls the system to retrace a similar electrochemical pathway during cycling, leading to voltage hysteresis. By sequentially monitoring relithiation and delithiation processes, the PI aims to unravel a series of complicated dynamic atomistic mechanisms at unprecedented length scales, including aggregation and segregation pathways of residual silicon topology, and formation of voltage hysteresis. The work is aimed to provide fundamental insights and to introducing new design concepts and principles for de novo computational-driven fabrication of lightweight and high performance rechargeable batteries, which may lead to a new line of research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Carbon chemistry at depth is responsible for carbon sequestration and volcanism. The growth of diamonds at depth not only drives an industry, but also traps and preserves our only samples of Earth's deep interior. Earth's lower mantle, the Earth's biggest layer, has great capacity for carbon even at very low concentrations and is thus important to the global carbon budget. The project will integrate research in the role of the mantle in Earth's deep carbon cycle with an education plan that includes recruitment of diverse students to laboratory geoscience and improves teaching of spatial reasoning, a critical skill for Earth scientists, at Michigan State University (MSU) and beyond. The whole-Earth carbon cycle is a timely subject well-suited to outreach to attract students with interest in environmental problems to careers in geosciences. Short modules on carbon mineralogy and geochemistry will be developed for gateway courses in geology and global change at MSU. The effectiveness of these exercises will be assessed in terms of recruitment of undergraduate majors and developing spatial reasoning skills for geoscience careers. Undergraduate and graduate research assistants will participate both in the lab and in geoscience teaching evaluation.<br/><br/>The primary research goal is to determine the stability of carbon-bearing phases in petrologic context at conditions of the lower mantle. Depth- and region-dependent differences in mantle mineralogy and oxygen fugacity (fO2) will result in changes in the speciation and host phases of carbon within the mantle phase assemblage. Quantifying the relationship between stability of carbon-bearing phases and pressure, temperature, redox conditions, and major mineralogy is critical to understanding the fate of carbon in Earth's interior. Experiments performed in laser-heated diamond anvil cells will provide some of the first experimental constraints on carbonate and carbide stability and physical properties in petrologic context of mantle phase assemblages at pressure-temperature conditions reaching the Core-Mantle Boundary (CMB). The results of the proposed experiments will be necessary to an integrated understanding of the origin, storage, and flux of carbon among a community including geochemists, cosmochemists, volcanologists, petrologists, mineralogists, and geophysicists. Earth's carbon cycle and popular interest in diamonds offer an opportunity to teach and recruit students through coursework and research assistantships. The education component of this project is a collaboration between the PI and geocognition expert Dr. Julie Libarkin to develop and evaluate educational modules incorporating deep carbon context and developing 3D reasoning skills. Modules will be evaluated by in-class observations, surveys and interviews and disseminated openly online.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An essential part of this effort is determining the sources of trace elements to the oceans, one of which is from the atmosphere: dust falling from the air, and rain, both deliver elements to the sea surface. This project would collect and analyze samples of rainwater and of particles from the atmosphere, along a U.S. GEOTRACES expedition from Alaska to Tahiti in the fall of 2018. The timing of the expedition corresponds to the part of the year with the highest atmospheric dust concentrations in the Gulf of Alaska and may also capture the tail end of peak fire season in Asia. In contrast, the southern end of the proposed ship track is known to have very low atmospheric dust. Aerosols will be influenced by human activity in Asia as well. The anticipated differences in atmospheric deposition along the ship track will allow the assessment of the role of this process on trace element and isotope cycling. The project will support a postdoctoral investigator. The relevance of ocean-atmosphere studies to the public will be communicated at campus open house events and in online forums in collaboration with the GEOTRACES management team.<br/><br/>In alignment with the mission of GEOTRACES, the proposed research will address the following biogeochemical and oceanographic questions: 1) What is the magnitude of atmospheric aerosol deposition (wet and dry) to the surface of the Pacific Ocean? 2) What is the chemical composition of these aerosols and how does composition vary based on source (e.g. Alaskan glacial flour, Asian mineral dust, emissions from biomass burning, anthropogenic emissions)? 3) What is the fractional solubility of trace elements in Pacific aerosols and does solubility vary based on aerosol source? 4) What is the potential bioavailability of soluble aerosol Fe? 5) How is the soluble fraction of aerosol trace elements distributed across operationally defined size classes? 6) How does atmospheric deposition impact distributions of other GEOTRACES parameters? Atmospheric aerosol and precipitation samples will be collected over the 70-day expedition and the investigators will provide sub-samples to collaborators and other interested scientists. These samples will be analyzed for a suite of key trace elements from bulk and size-fractionated aerosol samples, aerosol leachates, and rain samples. A sequential extraction scheme designed to solubilize aerosol Fe as a function of its FeOx morphology and particle size will be used on selected samples because an understanding of aerosol trace element fractional solubility is fundamental to future work to assess the bioavailability of aerosol derived trace elements. The proposed work will provide data that directly contribute to the GEOTRACES objectives related to atmospheric deposition and will help to address temporal variability as this cruise section follows the CLIVAR/Repeat Hydrography P16N line.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current methods for app design are largely based on either individual designer expertise and intuition, leading to variable results, or else require a large number of active users and engineering resources that are typically only available to large companies.  This project's goal is to solve the research challenges involved in automatically capturing and aggregating design features and user interactions across the large number of existing mobile applications already available for download and develop a platform allowing designers to learn from the choices and experiences other designers have made.  The platform will allow designers to find relevant third-party apps that have relevant design requirements and features, define experiments involving those design choices, and run the experiments by leveraging the existing user base of those apps.  This will help individual designers explore options more cheaply than developing their own prototypes while providing data-driven arguments to support design decisions and communicate with other members of their project teams.  The platform could also lead to tools to accumulate collective design knowledge, identifying emerging trends as well as best practices, useful for both practicing designers and as an educational resource for existing courses on web and app design.  <br/><br/>Developing the platform will require a number of technical advances.  The first involves developing scalable systems for capturing design features and interaction data from large numbers of mobile apps and combining them into representations useful for data mining.  To do this, the team will expand the existing ERICA platform for black-box design capture in a single application, developing it into a background monitoring app that captures interaction and design data for any app the user gives permission for, while detecting and obscuring personally identifying information.   The monitoring app will be deployed primarily via long-term crowdworkers who are paid to install it and participate in designer-defined experiments.  The second main advance is creating functional semantic embeddings for interface components based on the collected data that define common features, app states, and functions.  To do this the team will capture visual, textual, structural, and interactive information about each interface element, then use multimodal embeddings of the data to first classify individual interface elements, then use those labels to identify semantics of app screens and interaction flows between elements and screens.  The third advance involves developing a series of tools to use the data and semantic embeddings.  This includes working with designers to develop query techniques and views over sets of applications to find relevant applications and flows; creating visualizations of user behavior based on Sankey flow diagrams that allow designers to make sense of user behavior across applications; and designing app analytics tools to support meta-analysis across applications and experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is however less recognized that sea level rise can push water tables above the land surface to flood low-lying depressions. Lakes and wetlands that form by groundwater flooding expose connected aquifers to direct, continuous evaporation, which can result in substantial losses of water resources. Impacts from groundwater flooding and evaporation will be most intense on low-lying carbonate islands, where evaporated freshwater is replaced by seawater that percolates through the bedrock. These models incorporate impact of climate and predicted that lakes should remain fresh, and groundwater resources continuous, beneath islands in humid regions. In arid regions, lakes would be hypersaline, and much fresh groundwater would be replaced by seawater. In contrast to expectations, modern lakes that are formed by groundwater flooding in the arid southern Bahamas islands have salinities that range from fresh to hypersaline. This paradox between modeled and observed lake salinity underscores our lack of understanding of how groundwater flooding impacts island water resources. During this project, new field data will be collected, and new transient modeling tools will be developed, to test the overarching hypothesis that how groundwater flooding will impact island water resources. We will test the impact of lake area relative to its groundwater contributing area, the degree of connectivity between lakes and the ocean, and dynamic interactions with climate and sea level change on this process. The results of this study should improve predictions of freshwater resource loss of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) from groundwater flooding, perhaps the primary environmental factor triggering their loss of habitability. The modeling tools to be developed as part of this project will be freely distributed to the hydrological community. A field hydrogeology curricular exercise, with learning outcomes of quantitative coastal hydrology, will be developed to be used by the more than 100 student groups that visit the Gerace Research Centre (base of operation for this project) each year. Project results will be presented as part of a guest lecturer series at the University of the Bahamas and at international conferences. The project will enhance human resources by introducing coastal hydrology to 2 geology PhD students, and one civil engineering postdoctoral researcher at Michigan Tech. Each PI will work with their institution's diversity office to ensure that these positions are effectively advertised to under-represented groups.<br/><br/><br/>Evaporation of lakes and wetlands that form on islands by groundwater inundation reorganizes groundwater flow paths and lowers water tables. Impacts from groundwater inundation and evaporation will be most intense on low-lying carbonate islands, where the Ghyben-Herzberg relationship results in losses from freshwater lenses (the primary freshwater resource) being 40x the lowering of the water table. Primary controls on groundwater inundation will be sea-level rise and island topography, but impacts to freshwater resources could be moderated by climate (precipitation, and evaporation), aquifer permeability, ratio of groundwater contributing area to lake surface area, and distance between the lake and coast. During this project, new field data will be collected, and new transient modeling tools will be developed, to test the overarching hypothesis that groundwater inundation will reduce freshwater lens volumes through interactions of lake area relative to its groundwater contributing area, degree of connectivity between lakes and ocean, and dynamic interactions with climate and sea level change. Hypothesis testing will take a three-pronged approach. First, DEMs of San Salvador Island, Bahamas, will characterize lake hydrogeological setting (catchment/lake area ratios). Field observations of hydrogeological parameters and weather data will be used to estimate groundwater fluxes and lake evaporation; chemical and isotopic compositions of groundwater, lake water, and precipitation will be used to estimate recharge thresholds and lake water sources (ocean, groundwater, recharged precipitation). Second, a package for simulating dynamic flow and solute transport between lakes and groundwater will be developed and integrated into the SEAWAT/MODFLOW model in cllaboration with USGS. The model will be parameterized with observational data collected on San Salvador Island. Third, transient responses of island freshwater lenses to multiple sea level rise, climate change, and lake formation scenarios will be tested with the newly developed numerical modeling tool. Simulations will determine the nature of relationships between freshwater lens volumes and sea level, climatic variables, and island-lake hydrogeological settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Water table fluctuations introduce oxygen to shallow groundwater, which can react with ecologically important dissolved substances like organic carbon, nitrate, iron and manganese and have cascading effects on contaminants like arsenic. This project aims to understand how groundwater chemistry evolves in response to water table fluctuations over a range of timescales. Field observations, controlled laboratory column experiments, and computer models will quantify the movement of reactive solutes such as oxygen, nitrate, iron, and manganese beneath a fluctuating water table. Results will improve our understanding of dynamic changes in both groundwater and river water quality and the management of these vital water resources. This project will also introduce a broad audience of citizens and future scientists to dynamic surface water-groundwater interactions through the creation of a hands-on outdoor laboratory facility and museum exhibit.  <br/><br/>Water table fluctuations play an important role in reactive solute transport and water quality near rivers. When the water table rises, entrapped soil air exchanges oxygen with surrounding pore water, which travels downward when the water table falls. The enhanced supply of oxygen stimulates aerobic respiration, nitrification-denitrification, and oxidation of dissolved iron and manganese in groundwater. Water table fluctuations can propagate tens to hundreds of meters into an aquifer in response to changes in river stage. Yet the implications for reactive transport and water quality near rivers remain poorly understood. The overarching goal of this project is to quantify relationships between water table fluctuations, redox transformations, and solute export from aquifers to rivers. This project leverages novel sensor technology to observe the effects of water table fluctuations on groundwater chemistry in controlled column experiments and natural riparian aquifers. The four field sites in this study experience a range of water table fluctuations in response to tides, storms, and seasons. Each site has unique properties that influence reactive transport near the water table. However, pairs of sites also have commonalities in climate, lithology, catchment scale, land use, and geomorphology. Numerical fluid flow and reactive transport models will quantify dynamics in biogeochemical transformation rates and solute fluxes in these riparian aquifers. Observations and model results will be synthesized to generate a quantitative understanding of the effects of water table fluctuations on reactive solute transport in dynamic riparian aquifers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the current effects of glacier retreat on water supply in these regions can shed light on future water security threats in snow and ice-covered mountainous watersheds worldwide.  Glaciers are the ""water towers"" of the mountains: they store ice during wet periods and gradually release meltwater during dry periods. However, whether groundwater aquifers serve as extended reservoirs and whether plants also take up significant glacial meltwater remain unresolved questions.  These uncertainties make it difficult to predict the future reliability of water supply in mountainous watersheds, as glacier melt first accelerates and then eventually disappears, and as plants move to higher elevations in response to warming temperatures.  This project will develop a new and general computational watershed model that will incorporate chemical and isotopic data for tracing water flow source regions, as well as measurements from innovative low-cost, open-source environmental monitoring technologies. Results from the model can inform communities that rely on stream discharge from ice and snow-covered mountainous watersheds about present with regard to future water resources vulnerabilities, and can facilitate adaptation strategies as glacier retreat accelerates. <br/><br/>	The recession of glaciers will curtail their ability to modulate river discharge and its variability. Studies of this hydrologic consequence typically classify meltwater and groundwater as distinct contributors to streamflow, but this oversimplifies the potentially complex relationships among glaciers, their underlying groundwater systems, and ecohydrologic pathways. The investigators propose to assess these relationships using an integrated data-model approach in four rapidly changing, glacierized Ecuadorian watersheds, two each at Volcán Chimborazo and Volcán Cayambe. This work will produce a new isotope-enabled watershed model with reactive transport, to which data assimilation will be introduced in order to condition uncertain simulations in data-sparse watersheds with robust environmental tracers.  Open-source data loggers and sensors for measuring model input data will further advance critical-zone process understanding beyond data-intensive sites to remote settings that are undergoing some of the most rapid environmental change in the world.  This work will shed light on less-studied volcanic ranges that potentially facilitate greater infiltration of meltwater through their fractured bedrock, as well as expand the established water-resources focus on glacier retreat to also consider vegetation shift when examining the hydrologic response of glacierized mountainous watersheds to glacier retreat.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, many insects have specific calls which are barriers to mating between species. This diversity is in large part under the control of genes. Patterns of gene expression and regulation during development can also result in specific behaviors. However, it is unclear how differences in behavior relate to genetic differences: what is the contribution of changes in the actual genes relative to that of changes in gene regulation? This remains a fundamental open question of general importance, far beyond the diverse calls of insects. In this research this question is addressed in a katydid species that produces two alternative calls in response to the environment experienced during development. The differences between these calls within a population are due to differences in gene regulation. Population-level differences also occur across the geographic range of this insect, and this variation is largely caused by differences in individual's genes. This allows the assessment of the contributions of both genes and genetic regulation to the diversity of behavior in this species. This project integrates genetics, neurobiology, behavior, and evolution. Its outcomes contribute to the understanding of the genetic foundation of biodiversity and are relevant in many areas outside of animal behavior, including medical research. Broader impacts include training opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds that prepare them for the challenges of careers in life sciences. Outreach activities introduce the public to modern biology research in a relatable study system. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the genetic underpinnings of the call diversity in Neoconocephalus katydids. The species Neoconocephalus triops undergoes developmental plasticity (DP) that results in two alternative advertisement calls with species-level differences in two temporal properties (pulse rate and verse pattern). DP can be induced reliably by varying the photoperiod before sexual maturation. First, the relevant developmental stages and tissues (central pattern generators, CPG) in the CNS that contribute to the call pattern generation will be identified. Aim 1 identifies the location of the CPGs using lesion experiments, calcium imaging, and selectively heating of individual ganglia. In aim 2, the investigators identify the sensitive phase of phenotype induction by varying the exposure time of short day conditions and analyzing adult call phenotypes. Aim 3 explores the genetic underpinnings of the diversity of call patterns. RNAseq will be conducted using tissues containing the CPGs collected at the relevant times identified in aim 2.  Correlations between phenotypes and differences in gene expression patterns as well as genetic differences among populations will be identified. Comparisons include two call phenotypes of three populations that differ significantly in call pattern and extent of DP. In aim 4, the investigators will manipulate the expression levels of candidate genes identified in aim 3, using RNAi and examine the consequences for call phenotypes, moving from identifying correlations to testing causation. The outcomes provide testable hypotheses about the genetic control of call variation, which plays a significant role in the diversification of this group.  Training and outreach activities are focusing on the public and students of rural areas in MO, KY, and WV, which are traditionally underserved groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This challenge is a direct consequence of the devastating effects that disasters can produce on societies. These effects impact all facets of the socio-technical processes at the core of modern life. Disaster mitigation, preparedness, and response plans must be improved to minimize vulnerabilities, and to ensure that what is known can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of future efforts. Disaster logistics should be a whole-society effort, where the civic and public sectors participate to minimize the negative impacts of disasters. Disaster researchers have already established that the civic society plays a major role in all aspects of the response to extreme events, from search and rescue and relief distribution, to rebuilding efforts. They are often credited with being the first respondents due to their proximity to the impacted area. These groups are a very heterogeneous collection of formal and informal organizations with different structures and levels of expertise in disaster response. Previous field work has also shown that the civic society can provide effective response to their communities by means of leveraging their connections to access logistical resources and efficiently respond to the disaster. Frequently, these groups delivered relief supplies faster, and more effectively, than any of the large relief organizations. On the other hand, the activities of some groups can prove troublesome, such as the gathering of donations of non-priority supplies. The reality is that the majority of the donations that arrive at a disaster site are non-priority goods that severely complicate disaster response efforts. The main goal of this project is to identify lessons, both positive and negative, that the disaster community should learn from the experiences of the civic society during the responses to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Identifying these lessons will help future disaster responders to conduct more effective operations, and reduce the impacts of disasters on local communities, the economy, and the environment. This project studies the socio-technical factors that hamper the integration of Non-Established Relief Groups (NERGs) efforts and that of relief efforts that come from the outside to help. In addition, the research provides crucial knowledge about the role that NERGs play in the humanitarian logistics, and about how best to structure the interactions among the established groups, the official response and the NERGs, for maximum effectiveness. The data collected about the difficulties of relief groups to deliver supplies will help identify mechanisms to prevent these problems from happening in future disasters. The research documents the logistic structures that emerge in support of relief/early recovery efforts after a major extreme event and enable future model development based on these different relief approaches. The findings enhance theoretical understandings of organizations participating in these extreme event environments. <br/><br/>The research focuses on both formal and informal mechanisms through which NERGs identify, gather, deliver, and distribute relief items. Data collection includes short and informal as well as in-depth interviews with individuals involved in the logistics efforts, at all levels of action (e.g., international, national, re-gional, local, and community levels), from NERGs, and at all levels of power. In order to gain better understandings about the motivations behind physical donations, the team creates a directory of donation drives taking place across the US to support the relief efforts. The goal is to conduct longitudinal tracking of their operations, and perform in-depth studies of how these efforts are created, their evolution, and their decision-making patterns. This effort serves as the basis for more in-depth behavioral research. The researchers promote multidisciplinary collaboration, engages undergraduate and graduate students,and disseminate and integrate research findings into disaster courses. Improving humanitarian logistics operations can reduce human suffering and loss of life in disasters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Relationships between tectonic plates and the underlying mantle layer also remain debated, and those relationships are necessary to fully understand what actually drives plate motion on Earth. Locations like Indochina are particularly complex, influenced by a number of competing tectonic and mantle driving forces, and are thus important laboratories for better understanding how our planet functions as a dynamic, tectonic system. This study investigates the origins of recent volcanic activity and faulting in the Central Highlands of Vietnam. The goal of this research is to better understand the geologic setting of Indochina, particularly what tectonic and mantle processes drive faulting and volcanic activity. This work benefits society because it directly promotes scientific progress by investigating fundamental scientific questions about the planet and processes that shape it. The study contributes to broadening participation of underrepresented groups in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by providing support for two early career women scientists. The project supports STEM education and training of graduate and undergraduate students, thus contributing to the development of a diverse, globally competitive workforce. The project will contribute to increased public literacy and public engagement with STEM supporting outreach events with the University of Nebraska State Museum to disseminate scientific research and educate the local community, and through a written report detailing any new findings regarding potential hazards associated with recent volcanic eruption timing and newly discovered faults. The project facilitates collaboration between several U.S. universities, as well as international collaboration between U.S. and Vietnamese scientists.  <br/><br/>In detail, this project aims to test, develop, and refine a robust, comprehensive regional model that explains the dynamic origins of faulting and volcanism in Indochina, thereby increasing understanding of tectonics and mantle dynamics in complex regimes through the combined approaches of structural geology and igneous geochemistry. The project rationale is the advancement of scientific understanding of plate boundary and microplate dynamics and lithosphere-asthenosphere coupling effects. The central hypothesis for this project states that tectonic extrusion and coupled asthenospheric flow and upwelling have driven rotation of the Southern Indochina microplate, including propagation of strike-slip and normal faulting, and produced voluminous crustal magmatism without mantle plume involvement. The specific research goals for the proposed study are: 1) to evaluate age relationships between fault movement and volcanic activity in the Central Highlands of Vietnam, 2) to gather data to define the stress field of the Central Highlands and assess whether it is consistent with an extrusion- or extension-dominated tectonic regime, and 3) to assess the evidence for mantle upwelling in the same region by identifying mantle source origins (lithosphere vs. asthenosphere) for lavas erupted over time and with geographic distribution. These objectives will be achieved through field mapping of fault orientations and kinematics; isotope dating of volcanic eruptions; and comparative major element, trace element, and radiogenic isotope measurements in basalts and mantle xenoliths. The research is expected to trigger a thorough assessment of relationships between volcanism and faulting, the origin of the tectonic stress driving faulting, and identification of local magma sources over time, leading to a reconciled tectonic model for Indochina.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, harmful algal blooms in lakes can appear suddenly in response to subtle changes in environmental conditions. Knowing when and where they are likely to happen in time to prevent them or to reduce their impact can be quite challenging. Some scientists have suggested that there may be early warnings of algal blooms detectable by frequent measurements of water quality. Recent advances in technology now make it possible to measure water quality in real time using sensors.  These high frequency data provide a way to develop early warnings of imminent blooms of harmful algae. An effective early warning system will help scientists understand what causes harmful algal blooms and develop strategies to prevent them. This research will study how to use spatial patterns, in addition to changes over time, to more effectively detect early warnings in lakes where harmful algal blooms are expected to occur. The goal is to create a new approach to predicting when and where large changes to ecosystems will occur. The results will be useful for management as harmful algal blooms are a serious water quality and public health problem. Early warnings before blooms begin could help managers protect beaches, water quality, and other important public resources. This project will also involve outreach to journalists to help educate the public about efforts to prevent harmful algal blooms.<br/><br/>Empirical evaluation of spatial pattern in ecosystems requires a means of repeatedly generating spatially rich data. The Fast Limnology Automated Measurement (FLAMe) platform rapidly determines the spatial distribution of a suite of variables including phytoplankton pigments that are diagnostic of algal blooms. The project will generate pigment maps and a variety of spatial statistics using the FLAMe platform. Spatial patterns will be studied for lakes across a natural nutrient loading gradient and for a set of eutrophic lakes. Dynamic spatial models of lake phytoplankton will be developed to evaluate existing indicators and possibly develop new ones. Lakes near thresholds for algal blooms are hypothesized to have higher spatial variance, autocorrelation, and skewness than either more oligotrophic (low nutrient inputs) or more eutrophic lakes (high nutrient inputs). Spatial early warnings will be tested in a whole lake manipulation that compares a nutrient enriched lake to an unenriched reference lake. The enriched lake is hypothesized to increase in spatial variance, autocorrelation, and skewness prior to the development of a bloom.

Manufacturing therapeutic cells reliably is a major challenge. This project will define design and control parameters to make this possible. The initial focus is on producing a cell-based therapy for wound healing. If successful, the technology that is developed could lead to breakthroughs in treatments for other life-threatening diseases. An education plan will promote opportunities and training at the high school through post-graduate levels. A progressive program at the high school level that impacts hundreds of students per year will increase exposure to research opportunities and promote retention in STEM career paths. Community outreach programs will also be supported, and research findings will be integrated to enhance these programs.<br/><br/>Establishing new criteria for rational design of biomanufacturing approaches for therapeutic mesenchymal stem/stromal cell (MSC) exosomes is the focus of this project. Exosomes have therapeutic bioactivity, including vascularization. Many of the therapeutic effects associated with cell-based therapies are now being ascribed to protein, nucleic acid, and/or lipid transfer from exosomes and other extracellular vesicles secreted by implanted cells. The general hypothesis is that MSC exosome production and therapeutic bioactivity are defined by the cell culture microenvironment and the status of producer MSCs. The research objectives are to: 1) investigate the mechanism of vascularization bioactivity; 2) investigate the mechanism of cell density effects on production; and 3) develop quantitative predictive criteria to enable quality control of exosome production. If successful, this technology will impact patients by enabling new therapeutic options for wound repair, and ischemic and other diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, we still have a limited understanding of the diverse reasons that people access these technologies, which are likely to relate to cultural, religious, and socioeconomic factors. This research will address this gap by examining gamete transfer and donation in an understudied U.S. population. This project explores what impact the availability and effectiveness these technologies have in influencing reproductive decision-making. The findings from this project will be disseminated to organizations and individuals who inform public health practices and policies related to healthcare decision-making. The project also provides training for undergraduate students in methods of rigorous, scientific data collection and analysis.<br/> <br/>Dr. Daisy Deomampo of Fordham University will investigate the following research questions: How do sociocultural beliefs influence experiences of infertility and the use of assisted reproductive technologies (ARTs)? How do views and practices in reproductive medicine and science shape popular ideas about gamete donation? How do legal cases shed light on sociocultural understandings of the value of gametes? The research will focus on a cohort of Asian American gamete donors and recipients, selected because they are overlooked in research on gamete donation, yet have a high rate of ART utilization, and an older mean age of mothers at first birth compared to other ethnic groups. In order to comprehend how diverse groups in Asian America experience social and cultural issues related gamete donation, this ethnographic study is located in three metropolitan areas with significant diversity in Asian populations: New York, NY, Los Angeles, CA, and Honolulu, HI. Data collection will include in-depth interviews and participant observation with doctors, donor coordinators, and gamete providers and recipients. This project will also include textual analysis of court cases, media coverage, online forums, and policy documents. These data will be used to facilitate analysis of two important themes: the social construction of identity in medical practice, and the role of identity in shaping ideas about reproduction and genetic inheritance. By exploring the social meanings attached to identity and DNA in the context of gamete donation, this project will offer much-needed ethnographic perspective on the bioethical and policy implications of reproductive technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are many words that reflect subjective attitudes, including adjectives such as 'fun,' 'frightening' and 'unhealthy.' An important question is whose perspective or opinion these subjective words are anchored to--whose opinion it is that something is frightening, or fun, or unhealthy. Identifying whose opinion these kinds of subjective words reflect is important. For example, consider a physician deeming a certain individual to be unhealthy compared to a friend with no medical training conveying the same sentiment. However, identifying whose opinion a subjective adjective is anchored to is not always straightforward. The type of sentence in which the word occurs influences its meaning. If someone states 'The situation was frightening,' that speaker is often interpreted as the arbiter of what counts as 'frightening,' but if someone asks a friend 'Was the situation frightening?' then the perspective shifts and the friend's opinion of what counts as frightening also matters. The current project aims to improve understanding of how people understand subjective words, including shifts from one person's perspective to another's perspective, and how language-based and social-interaction-based factors influence this. This research may inform theories of language use, as well as the design of interventions to improve communication in contexts such as health, legal and educational settings.  An understanding of the relation between language and people's personal opinions/attitudes may also be relevant when dealing with social tensions due to attitude divergence, as well as investigations of subjective perspective-taking in nontypical populations.<br/><br/>This research will contribute to our understanding of subjective perspective-taking and its interfaces with language. The research uses both online and offline experimental methods to examine the mechanisms and representations involved in the interpretation of subjective linguistic expressions. The researchers will investigate whether and to what extent subjective expressions of different types trigger perspective-shifts during language processing, and whether this is modulated by top-down contextual factors. The project will also gauge the extent to which interpretation of perspective-sensitive elements is guided by the linguistic context in which they occur and how the perspective-holder is activated during real-time processing. Current debate in psycholinguistics regarding perspective-taking primarily focuses on objective situations where individuals differ in what they know or can observe directly, whereas much of the recent debate on perspective in theoretical linguistics has centered on subjective differences between individuals' opinions and attitudes.  The studies in this project will broaden the empirical basis of work on perspectival processing and will further our understanding of how humans process perspective-sensitive linguistic material.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a consequence, the diversity of opinions about possible solutions waxes and wanes over time. How these changes in diversity of opinion affect group performance is an open question, with extant studies finding both positive and negative effects. This project will investigate whether these inconsistent findings can be explained by how diversity interacts with task complexity and group threat. Higher diversity of opinions about possible solutions can be adaptive when groups face complex tasks, while lower diversity can help in collective solving of simple tasks. In addition, groups that have more homogeneous views, and are therefore better coordinated, often have an advantage in intergroup conflict. As a consequence, when group threat leads to decreased diversity of opinions, it might have negative effects on performance in complex tasks, but neutral or even positive effects for simple tasks. Furthermore, groups can be expected to use strategies to adaptively manipulate their level of diversity according to task complexity and experienced threat. This project will therefore also investigate the adaptive value of such strategies, including policing, ostracism, and denigrating outgroups. Overall, understanding factors that promote or suppress the diversity of opinions is immensely important today for national security issues. Current communication technologies offer unprecedented opportunities for interactions with many different people, and yet they also seem to facilitate formation of relatively isolated communities of people with similar opinions. Better theoretical and empirical understanding of factors that influence the diversity of opinions in real-world communities, and that moderate the value of diversity for finding good societal solutions, is necessary for maintaining and promoting a healthy democratic dialogue. To promote further research in this area, the project will also provide unique training opportunities for students at the intersection of cognitive and social sciences, computational linguistics, and network science, and include two interdisciplinary working groups discussing promising directions for theoretical and methodological progress in understanding diversity in modern societies.<br/><br/>To study how task complexity and group threat influence opinion diversity and the resulting group performance, and to investigate mechanisms that real-world communities use to manage their diversity in response to these factors, the project will first integrate several previously disconnected literatures on exploration-exploitation trade-offs, group behavior and decision making under threat, social learning, altruistic punishment, ostracism, and stereotyping. The resulting hypotheses will be tested using three different methodologies: computational modeling, group experiments, and computational linguistics analyses of discussions on online news sites involving thousands of users over prolonged time periods. This will allow for robustness checks and mitigation of risks of relying on only one method. These theoretical and methodological developments will foster further scientific research of modern human sociality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, these vaccines must be delivered into the intradermal region of the skin, which is known to promote an enhanced immune response. Such a precise, consistent delivery of these drugs, which can be quite viscous, has not yet been achieved. One potential method to resolve this issue is needle-free jet injection, whereby liquid is forced out of a narrow orifice at high-speed and punctures the skin. This technique has been routinely applied for deeper (subcutaneous and intramuscular) injections, but now holds promise for intradermal delivery as well. Therefore, the principal aim of this project is to provide a deep understanding of the key factors governing intradermal injection with liquid jets. The project will also encompass significant educational activities, including a multi-year undergraduate research program, industry-based training and an outreach program for the local homeschool community.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a comprehensive picture of needle-free jet injection into intradermal regions of the skin. This complex process involves creation of a high-speed, slender and coherent jet, which impacts and punctures the skin and then disperses in a poro-elastic heterogeneous matrix of tissue. None of these features have been adequately assessed, either experimentally or theoretically. We propose to fill this broad knowledge gap with the combination of a rigorous experimental campaign and theoretical treatment focused in three specific aims: (i) Understanding the role of rheology in jet characteristics, (ii) Defining the criteria for maintaining jet coherency, and (iii) Determining the factors limiting fluid accumulation in the intradermal region. On the experimental side, we will use high-speed video tracking and dynamic force measurements to characterize the jet start-up, steady-stream speed and peak force for a variety of configurations and fluids. We will also perform both ex-vivo and in-vitro injection studies to examine the accumulation of fluid in the intradermal region. On the modeling front, we will focus on stability and coherence of the jet as a function of geometry prior to the orifice and fluid properties. Our approach is expected to yield unprecedented understanding and provide the platform for future innovation in needle-free injection.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims to reverse the well-documented trend of U.S. student achievement in STEM falling behind that of other industrialized nations. MTP will prepare a cadre of 20 middle school STEM teachers, selected for their potential to lead local and statewide STEM education reform efforts.  MTP may serve as a model for other national efforts because it has the potential to produce a self-sustaining professional learning network consisting of teachers who can carry the project forward with little external aid. The project uniquely builds on an established statewide network of reform-focused individuals and organizations that are part of the Michigan Science Teaching and Assessment Reform (Mi-STAR) program. MTP will focus on the middle school level and emphasize applications of science and to real-world problems that are relevant to students and their families in Michigan. <br/><br/>To implement MTP, Michigan Technological University will collaborate with high-need Kalamazoo Public Schools and Saginaw Public Schools, and with two non-profit organizations: Michigan Science Teacher Association and Michigan Earth Science Teacher Association. MTP will provide financial support for two cohorts: ten Master Teaching Fellows with master's degrees in their field and ten Fellows with bachelor's degrees in a STEM discipline, who are also enrolled in the institution's Master of Science in Applied Science Education.  Upon completion of the initial professional learning training, Fellows with a master's degree will move into leadership positions in their schools and districts and will also serve as mentors for MTP teachers pursuing a master's degree. MTP will prepare Fellows pursuing a master's degree to assume increasing levels of leadership in their schools and districts. An outcome of the project will be its production of teacher-leaders who are prepared to help other teachers effectively implement ""three-dimensional"" instructional practices, which are performance expectations for students in the Next Generation Science Standards and Michigan Science Standards.

This overwork culture stems from the expectation that ideal workers should put work before family and demonstrate unlimited and undivided commitment to work. This norm may be especially problematic for American women, whose time availability is more likely to be limited by caregiving responsibilities. This study investigates this ideal worker norm, and the conditions under which the norm might change.  The project studies organizational policies that allow time off and flexibility in work schedules and locations, as well as conditions under which these policies are implemented.  It also investigates female managerial representation in the organization, which may be important for organizational adoption of new policies to help women in the workplace. The project will also examine how these organizational conditions affect employee outcomes, such as employee assessment of their fit to the ideal worker norm, and their careers and health. This project shows how changes in the overwork culture may be possible in contemporary American workplaces.<br/><br/>The project conducts a nationally representative, probability-based survey of employees and then matches employee data to organization-level data drawn from the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) EEO-1 database. EEO-1 data offer workplace gender and race composition at the establishment level, as well as basic workplace characteristics, such as industry and establishment size. This linked employee-employer data will allow examination of how the ideal worker norm varies by workplace characteristics, and how different organizational conditions influence employee outcomes while controlling for other organizational characteristics.  The probability-based employee sample allows findings to generalize to employed adults working in medium to large organizations in the United States. The employee-employer linked data set will provide a unique opportunity to address questions that span the individual and the organization-level, and in identifying the macro conditions that may reshape the ideal worker norm and its impact on individual workers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This switch in human food supply has similar timing to the end of the African Humid Period when a drop in rainfall in Northern Africa and southern Europe decreased oceanic productivity and dried-up wetlands and savanna in North Africa. Hence, it is possible that the end of the African Humid Period played a role in reducing the yields of marine fisheries exploited by Neolithic people and 'nudging' them to find other resources. This project will reconstruct marine fish abundances through the Neolithic-Bronze Age transition by counting and identifying fish teeth in deep sea sediments. The research will support US involvement in the international ""EMPIRE"" Expedition to the Aegean and Adriatic seas. Sediment cores collected during the cruise will provide a first quantitative assessment of how those civilizations were affected by available fish stocks. The use of fish teeth is a novel new proxy system for directly studying fish communities and will provide a 'proof-of-concept' test for the method. The results will be significant because fish teeth make it possible to quantify fish stocks in the past, show the relationship between fish communities and environmental change, and assess our impact on fish populations through fishing. Prior to this new work on fish teeth, almost all studies of ocean productivity have focused on unicellular plankton and have been blind to changes in the fisheries resources that societies rely on. <br/><br/>The project will obtain samples that can be used to test the links between human resource use and the natural abundance of fish. While archaeologists can tell us how many fish people have been consuming, there has been no other direct way to assess what fisheries resources have been like, or how fishing pressure may have changed those resources over time. This project will examine whether the intensity and pattern of human exploitation of fish is linked to the availability of marine resources by supporting participation in an international research cruise (EMPIRE Expedition) designed to quantify changes in terrestrial and marine ecosystems during the rise of human civilization around the Aegean and Adriatic. The expedition will collect ""Kasten"" cores that recover the large volumes of sediment needed for fish tooth research. These cores will be sampled using custom-built plastic core boxes (purchased through this project) so that the cores can be delivered intact to the US to allow for evaluation of core stratigraphy using XRF and x-ray imaging. The project will return large amounts of new core material from the Mediterranean to the Scripps Geological Collections where it will be available to the US community through normal sample requests. The project will enable proof-of-concept research on fish communities to be integrated with the larger international effort to understand human impacts on vegetation, soil erosion, ocean production, and paleoclimate in the region. In turn, this environmental work will be linked with human cultural development seen through archaeological and historical data sets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The performance of fuzzers is critical, as a faster, smarter fuzzer will find more security bugs in the target program more quickly.<br/><br/>This project takes a novel approach to fuzzing performance by shortening the execution time of each fuzzing iteration by trying to achieve more test coverage in a fixed time interval, whereas other approaches focus on convergence to input sets that are more likely to trigger a vulnerability. In the process, the project will overcome hidden scalability and performance bottlenecks caused at the system software layers, such as operating system and hypervisor.

For example, many insects have specific calls which are barriers to mating between species. This diversity is in large part under the control of genes. Patterns of gene expression and regulation during development can also result in specific behaviors. However, it is unclear how differences in behavior relate to genetic differences: what is the contribution of changes in the actual genes relative to that of changes in gene regulation? This remains a fundamental open question of general importance, far beyond the diverse calls of insects. In this research this question is addressed in a katydid species that produces two alternative calls in response to the environment experienced during development. The differences between these calls within a population are due to differences in gene regulation. Population-level differences also occur across the geographic range of this insect, and this variation is largely caused by differences in individual's genes. This allows the assessment of the contributions of both genes and genetic regulation to the diversity of behavior in this species. This project integrates genetics, neurobiology, behavior, and evolution. Its outcomes contribute to the understanding of the genetic foundation of biodiversity and are relevant in many areas outside of animal behavior, including medical research. Broader impacts include training opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds that prepare them for the challenges of careers in life sciences. Outreach activities introduce the public to modern biology research in a relatable study system. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the genetic underpinnings of the call diversity in Neoconocephalus katydids. The species Neoconocephalus triops undergoes developmental plasticity (DP) that results in two alternative advertisement calls with species-level differences in two temporal properties (pulse rate and verse pattern). DP can be induced reliably by varying the photoperiod before sexual maturation. First, the relevant developmental stages and tissues (central pattern generators, CPG) in the CNS that contribute to the call pattern generation will be identified. Aim 1 identifies the location of the CPGs using lesion experiments, calcium imaging, and selectively heating of individual ganglia. In aim 2, the investigators identify the sensitive phase of phenotype induction by varying the exposure time of short day conditions and analyzing adult call phenotypes. Aim 3 explores the genetic underpinnings of the diversity of call patterns. RNAseq will be conducted using tissues containing the CPGs collected at the relevant times identified in aim 2.  Correlations between phenotypes and differences in gene expression patterns as well as genetic differences among populations will be identified. Comparisons include two call phenotypes of three populations that differ significantly in call pattern and extent of DP. In aim 4, the investigators will manipulate the expression levels of candidate genes identified in aim 3, using RNAi and examine the consequences for call phenotypes, moving from identifying correlations to testing causation. The outcomes provide testable hypotheses about the genetic control of call variation, which plays a significant role in the diversification of this group.  Training and outreach activities are focusing on the public and students of rural areas in MO, KY, and WV, which are traditionally underserved groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the past 15 years, driven by increasingly challenging fuel economy standards, sheet steels used in automotive bodies have achieved strengths that are five times those of previous alloys. Normally, increasing strength results in a compromise in ductility - the ability for a material to stretch or bend without fracture - but these new Advanced High Strength Steel (AHSS) sheets minimize the severity of this compromise. The primary way this has been achieved is by designing the microscopic structure of the steels to resist fracture, based on new understanding of how to control this structure when manufacturing steels. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) Award supports fundamental scientific research to uncover the relationships between the processing of these steels, the microscopic structure, and their properties and performance. A broad range of deformation conditions will be studied to better understand the material response and allow the design of steels with even better properties. This will further improve the automobile structures and help meet stringent fuel economy standards, and can also be translated to other sectors to improve the efficiency and performance in many other steel applications.<br/><br/>This work will aim to close the design loop to develop a fundamental understanding of austenite stability during thermomechanical processing (TMP) of advanced high strength steel (AHSS) alloys that use the Transformation Induced Plasticity (TRIP) mechanism to yield exceptional combinations of strength and ductility. The ability for strain-induced austenite-to-martensite transformation to suppress strain localization, and thereby produce excellent properties, is dependent on the thermal and mechanical stability of the austenite; if austenite is too stable, it will not transform during deformation, and if austenite is unstable, it will not be retained at room temperature. Current approaches to stabilize austenite focus on increasing carbon content by performing precise thermal cycles that allow diffusion of carbon from other phases to austenite. Here the research focuses on the use of deformation conditions, including strain rate, strain state, temperature, and stress state/pressure, to understand how to further control austenite stability by performing focused mechanical testing of specifically designed alloys. The understanding developed in this work will result in a science-based understanding of austenite stability in AHSS that can be incorporated into thermodynamic and mechanical materials models, and which will enable the use of Integrated Computation Materials Engineering (ICME) and Materials Genome Initiative (MGI) principles to realize advanced manufacturing and further improve the exceptional properties that can be realized in these low-alloy, low-cost materials that underpin our efforts for lightweight structures in the transportation sector and beyond. <br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The subject grew into a testing ground for Intersection Theory, which is now a cornerstone of modern mathematics.  This workshop will bring together researchers and students coming from different backgrounds, to present various points of view on the subject of Schubert Calculus.<br/><br/>A large part of Schubert Calculus concerns the cohomology rings of Grassmannians and flag manifolds, as well as their generalizations. The subject has deep connections to combinatorics, representation theory, and algebraic geometry, and the last 15 years have seen remarkable developments in the techniques of Schubert Calculus.  A guiding problem is to find combinatorial formulas for the multiplication of Schubert classes in flag varieties; several new cases of this problem were solved.  New research has extended our understanding of Schubert calculus to the infinite-dimensional affine (and Kac-Moody) flag varieties, simultaneously deepening the connection with representation theory.  Major goals of this conference include sharing new results and introducing a new generation of students to the techniques, applications, and open problems in the field.

Currently, available manufacturing processes for two-dimensional materials require high temperatures or complex chemical treatment, which limits their large-scale production. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award investigates scalable electrochemical exfoliation and functionalization of two-dimensional materials with the aim of controlling their structures and properties for high-performance energy storage devices. Two-dimensional materials come in many compositions and are increasingly utilized in consumer electronics, electric vehicles, smart grids, and renewable energy systems. The capability to produce high quality two-dimensional materials contributes significantly to the nation's economy and advances prosperity and welfare. The award aligns well with NSF's Quantum Leap effort because two-dimensional materials with controlled film thickness and point defects are candidate materials for quantum devices, including sensing, computing and communicating. This research is multidisciplinary, including manufacturing, electrochemistry and nanotechnology, and motivates students with diverse backgrounds to consider future careers in science and engineering. The project develops an energy education module in collaboration with high school teachers to teach energy storage mechanisms and calculation of energy and power densities tied with chemistry, physics, and math curricula. The energy education module can be tested and expanded over a broad range of underrepresented students through NSF INCLUDES program. <br/><br/>The electrochemical manufacturing process has many advantages over conventional manufacturing techniques of fabricating two-dimensional (2D) atomic layer materials, including low-cost, simple operation, rapid production rate, and in-situ functionalization, by taking advantage of scalable and controllable nature of the electrochemical process. However, some scientific barriers, such as mechanistic understanding of electrochemical exfoliation and quantitative methods for controlling the structure and properties, need to be overcome in order to realize the full potential of electrochemical manufacturing of 2D materials. This project investigates comprehensive and general expansion, exfoliation and functionalization mechanisms during the manufacture of these materials in electrochemical processing, specifically, structural changes and gas formation as a function of applied potential. It evaluates properties of the electrochemical processed materials, and establishes processing parameter-structure-property relationships. The work can potentially transform the manufacturing process of 2D materials into a highly scalable and controllable process that can fabricate structure- and property-tuned 2D nanomaterials for specific target applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One challenge facing military spouses is that of finding work and maintaining a career in the face of repeated moves and deployments.  This project will reveal whether and the extent to which the public and employers view military spouse job seekers differently than their civilian peers, and if so, how frequent geographic mobility in the past, or assumptions about moves in the future, influence the perceptions of military spouses as job candidates. The project studies how stereotypes of military spouses as frequent movers and job changers may lead to anticipatory discrimination based on presumptions of future behavior when seeking work. Because military spouse employment problems may influence the retention decisions of their service member, this issue has implications for recruiting and retention of a high-quality military force. In doing so, this study offers evidence that may be useful in creating effective policy solutions for military families, as well as other dual income households. <br/><br/>This study will use complementary experimental and qualitative methods, including survey vignette experiments with actual hiring agents and a series of employer interviews, to identify whether and to what extent hiring agents treat military spouses seeking employment differently than similar civilian peers, and why. The project develops and tests a theory of anticipatory discrimination by explicitly evaluating how past geographic mobility and future expectations of geographic stability influence evaluations of women job seekers, and whether past and future geographic stability accounts for any differential evaluations of military spouse job seekers. The survey experiment is complemented by interviews with actual hiring agents in four labor markets to understand their past experiences with military spouse employees, how they perceive them as applicants, and how hiring decisions are influenced by anticipated futures of these applicants.  The proposed research enhances the study of military spouses and tied migrant labor market outcomes in several ways. First, the project provides explicit attitudinal and behavioral evidence of differential treatment of military spouses relative to civilian spouses. Second, the study broadens the research base on military spouse and tied migrant employment by locating employers as central influences on military spouse unemployment. Third, the proposed research also tests how military spouses and civilian tied migrants are evaluated across labor markets characterized by different levels of military presence. While the case under study centers on one type of worker, similar processes operate with other groups. The concept of anticipatory discrimination may offer new ways to conceive of legal protections for categories of workers based around presumed or actual future statuses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, much scholarship combines these two social structures under the notion of hierarchy, making it difficult to detect how each might be unique. We also do not know how each structure may change over time. This project addresses these gaps by asking how organizational status and authority hierarchies co-evolve. The project investigates whether higher status is associated with exercising authority; whether exercising authority changes a person's relative status; and what the temporal patterns of these changes tell us about the mechanisms linking them. The project studies user actions from over 90,000 workers in 1700 organizations over nearly three years.  These findings help us understand the evolution of inequality at work, with a focus on how authority operates in smaller organizations, where two thirds of net new jobs in the United States are created.  In doing so it will provide policy guidance regarding how smaller workplaces can be organized to reduce social inequality.    <br/><br/><br/>This project analyzes hierarchies in motion by asking how status and authority hierarchies co-evolve in small organizations.  To measure these hierarchies, the project uses uniquely detailed anonymized metadata from five billion user actions taken in a project-and-task-management software system.  These data make it possible to separate the exercise of authority from other actions for 90,000 individuals in 1700 organizations over nearly three years. These data are combined with three months of participant observation at one of these organizations and interviews with managers and employees at it and eight other organizations.

While the ability to forecast the track of tropical cyclones has improved, gaps remain in the knowledge and understanding of their formation or genesis, which is reflected in poorer forecasts.  Recent results suggest that the African easterly waves pathway to genesis in the Atlantic Basin is influenced by the passage of eastward-moving convectively coupled Kelvin Waves.  However, a quantitative assessment of the processes and predictability of these interactions is lacking.  This collaborative research project between the University of Miami and the University at Albany seeks to provide such a quantitative assessment and to seek a more definite answer to an outstanding question in the tropical storm research: ""why do some African easterly waves develop into Tropical Cyclone (TC) and others do not?"".  The project is divided into three phases.  The first phase will use three decades of observational and reanalysis data to test hypotheses on the physical mechanisms related to the attribution of genesis or lack of genesis to convectively coupled Kelvin Waves, on time scales of 1-3 days.  The second phase will use two decades of archived ensemble forecast data to investigate and quantify the predictability in the context of these physical mechanisms.  The third phase will extend these ideas out to 1-2 weeks, accounting for the roles of the Madden-Julian Oscillation and El Niño and the Southern Oscillation.  One novel aspect of the project is the awareness of the need to take account of convectively coupled Kelvin Wave amplitude and favorability of African Easterly Wave structures for genesis.  A second novel development is to use ensemble forecasts to push the boundaries of predictability, in identifying the extent to which the complex interactions are predictable out to 1-2 weeks, and connecting the predictability ideas to the governing physical mechanisms and large-scale flow regimes.<br/><br/>The research will provide quantitative information to support tropical forecasters.  The research will also bridge the gap between the weather and subseasonal prediction communities by advancing our understanding of science and predictability beyond traditional weather time scales, which is recognized nationally and globally as a priority.  This will lead to the identification of regimes where predictive skill of genesis and tropical cyclone activity is high or low, thereby providing information to forecasters and ultimately the decision makers who take actions based on a potential tropical cyclone threat.  A by-product of the research will be the feedback provided to operational modeling centers on strengths and weaknesses of their ensemble forecasts.  Diagnostic tools developed in this research will be shared with the research community.  The project will also advance Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education by funding two students to pursue doctoral research, and in advancing new undergraduate and graduate courses on tropical meteorology.  An annual exchange between Miami and Albany will enable the students to visit meteorological centers and facilities in their reciprocal cities.  Undergraduate Honors thesis projects will be developed.  Several outreach activities related to tropical cyclones, aimed at increasing scientific literacy among decision-makers, the media and public will be continued as part of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These events result in more than just the loss of physical property, as community and neighborhood attributes encompass many different aspects of an individual's social relationships and the cultural institutions. Moving to a new community changes these attributes and will affect an individual's political attitudes and behaviors. This research is therefore able to address not just the immediate policy implications of such displacements but also a classic and important question in social science: how does local context affects political opinions and behaviors? The ongoing post-Harvey migration provides a unique opportunity to examine the effect of social contact and political context in a case where these encounters could not have otherwise been anticipated by the individuals affected. This project will examine the political consequences of Hurricane Harvey by studying post-Harvey migration patterns as an unexpected or exogenous shock. The exogenous shock will allow an understanding of (1) variations in the decision of displaced individuals to move to different areas and how this affects their associated experiences once they move, and (2) how people's political attitudes and behaviors change in response to rapid demographic shifts in their communities. <br/><br/>This research holds great significance because geographic residence is rarely if ever randomly assigned, which makes it difficult to establish whether observed correlations are the result of contextual effects or individuals' self-selection into particular ideological and social communities. Similarly, social contact may have a positive effect because those individuals willing to engage across social barriers are also the individuals who are more likely to change their minds on political issues. This research project teases apart these potentially confounding variables to truly understand their independent effects. To study these relationships, publicly available data from Twitter and the Texas voter registration file will be used. The ongoing post-Harvey migration provides a unique opportunity to examine the effect of social contact and political context in a case where these encounters could not have otherwise been anticipated. This work will build on results on the political attitudes of displaced individuals after Hurricane Katrina. As a result of New Orleans? unique racial geography, Katrina evacuees were more likely to be people of color and of lower socioeconomic status. The 2017 flooding in the greater Houston area, however, affected both rich and poor communities alike, as well as majority white and majority-minority communities.

For example, harmful algal blooms in lakes can appear suddenly in response to subtle changes in environmental conditions. Knowing when and where they are likely to happen in time to prevent them or to reduce their impact can be quite challenging. Some scientists have suggested that there may be early warnings of algal blooms detectable by frequent measurements of water quality. Recent advances in technology now make it possible to measure water quality in real time using sensors.  These high frequency data provide a way to develop early warnings of imminent blooms of harmful algae. An effective early warning system will help scientists understand what causes harmful algal blooms and develop strategies to prevent them. This research will study how to use spatial patterns, in addition to changes over time, to more effectively detect early warnings in lakes where harmful algal blooms are expected to occur. The goal is to create a new approach to predicting when and where large changes to ecosystems will occur. The results will be useful for management as harmful algal blooms are a serious water quality and public health problem. Early warnings before blooms begin could help managers protect beaches, water quality, and other important public resources. This project will also involve outreach to journalists to help educate the public about efforts to prevent harmful algal blooms.<br/><br/>Empirical evaluation of spatial pattern in ecosystems requires a means of repeatedly generating spatially rich data. The Fast Limnology Automated Measurement (FLAMe) platform rapidly determines the spatial distribution of a suite of variables including phytoplankton pigments that are diagnostic of algal blooms. The project will generate pigment maps and a variety of spatial statistics using the FLAMe platform. Spatial patterns will be studied for lakes across a natural nutrient loading gradient and for a set of eutrophic lakes. Dynamic spatial models of lake phytoplankton will be developed to evaluate existing indicators and possibly develop new ones. Lakes near thresholds for algal blooms are hypothesized to have higher spatial variance, autocorrelation, and skewness than either more oligotrophic (low nutrient inputs) or more eutrophic lakes (high nutrient inputs). Spatial early warnings will be tested in a whole lake manipulation that compares a nutrient enriched lake to an unenriched reference lake. The enriched lake is hypothesized to increase in spatial variance, autocorrelation, and skewness prior to the development of a bloom. The research will provide new knowledge of spatial patterns in lakes as nutrient status changes, as well as new insights about spatial variability and change indicators. The study will systematically explore spatial indicators for blooms and generate hypotheses testable in other types of ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process is called nitrogen fixation and it is important ecologically because it allows microorganisms to live in habitats where they would otherwise be unable to grow.  Nitrogen fixation occurs both on land and in the oceans.  One of the key questions facing oceanographers today is resolving how much nitrogen fixation is occurring in the surface ocean and how it varies temporally, on timescales of days to seasons, and spatially, across different biomes.  This work will develop high throughput analysis of nitrogen fixation at sea so that measurements can be made in real-time onboard oceanographic research vessels.  This will help improve targeted sampling of the water-column and facilitate the comparison of nitrogen fixation with rates of photosynthesis which are currently conducted on timescales of minutes to hours.  The work will be done at the Center for Microbial Oceanography: Research and Education (C-MORE) where Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders majoring in an ocean or earth science-related field are given opportunities for scientific training and laboratory experience.  To engage the high-school students in the work and inform them about opportunities in scientific careers, we will hold one to two outreach events per year targeting sixth to eighth grade girls at local public charter schools.<br/><br/>This research will use a highly-sensitive reduced gas analyzer to quantify the production of hydrogen gas which is a metabolic by-product of the nitrogen fixation process.  To improve the detection limit, seawater samples will be sparged with the inert gas argon to inhibit the reduction of nitrogen gas by the nitrogenase enzyme.  Under this scenario, nitrogenase transfers all the electrons used to reduce nitrogen gas into the production of hydrogen.  This technique of amplifying the production of hydrogen via nitrogen fixation is familiar to the biohydrogen research community and will be developed for sea-going oceanographic purposes.  This proposal will test the method on laboratory cultures of diazotrophs to verify the ratio of hydrogen gas production to traditional methods of nitrogen fixation analysis such as stable isotope incorporation into biomass.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In turn, these are influenced by the aerosol particles that act as nuclei for the formation of cloud droplets. This project will investigate on how the aerosols and cloud droplets interact within a turbulent environment, in the context of both the aerosol first and second indirect effects (albedo and lifetime effects).<br/><br/>The studies will be performed in the Pi Chamber, in which clouds are generated through isobaric mixing within a turbulent environment. The laboratory environment allows for aerosol-cloud interaction in the presence of constant thermodynamic forcing and turbulence properties. The laboratory system does not attempt to reconstruct the full complexity of the atmosphere, but rather aims to isolate specific aspects of the aerosol-cloud system.<br/><br/>Objectives of the project are to investigate the transient response of clouds as they interact with and cleanse the surrounding aerosol population; To investigate supersaturation variability in a turbulent environment; To investigate the growth of cloud droplets in a steady-state, turbulent environment, specifically to understand the relative roles of the phase relaxation time and the turbulence correlation times; To continue development of a Large Eddy Simulation (LES)/bin-microphysics model for comparison with and interpretation of laboratory observations, with the eventual purpose of serving as a bridge to the full atmospheric context; And to perform initial exploratory work on the ability to form and measure mixed-phase clouds.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Results from the Pi Chamber have already led to the verification that cloud droplet growth by condensation is fundamentally different when the phase relaxation time is small or large compared to the turbulence correlation time; and to the illustration that this provides a mechanism for accelerating aerosol activation and cloud collapse. Both of these processes are fundamentally linked to aerosol-cloud interactions and their influence on indirect effects. This research builds directly on those results and will lead to a deeper understanding of cloud cleansing of aerosols, supersaturation variability in turbulent flows, and how that supersaturation variability influences the broadening of cloud droplet size distributions, key aspects of the precipitation formation problem. The results also will be compared with a LES/bin microphysics cloud model that can serve as a link to studying the phenomena identified in the laboratory in the context of the more complex atmosphere. Finally, the study will provide further insight into the conditions necessary to generate steady-state mixed-phase clouds.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>Precipitation formation and radiative properties of clouds are critical aspects of the climate and weather forecasting problems. They are therefore issues of immediate societal relevance and have potential to translate to tangible economic benefits and improvements in the human condition.<br/><br/>The Pi Chamber uses Rayleigh-Benard convection as the mechanism for producing supersaturation for cloud formation. The research will contribute to the diverse community of researchers studying Rayleigh-Benard convection. It will have relevance to the vast range of applied problems studied by that community, from stellar atmospheres to the earth's mantle to applications of myriad engineering problems involving turbulent heat transfer.<br/><br/>Finally, the Pi Chamber provides valuable opportunities for education: from outreach at the K-12 levels, to undergraduate internships and senior projects, and finally to graduate student and postdoctoral research. The current project includes support for two full-time graduate students who will become well versed in the operation of the cloud chamber as well as with the wide range of associated instrumentation.  Outreach events in the cloud chamber lab will be continued on a regular basis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia.  The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign grants is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on ""OTREC"".<br/><br/>Tropical convection plays a critical role in earth's climate system and is also responsible for extreme precipitation and hurricane formation.  Easterly waves are of particular interest for weather forecasting given their tendency to spawn hurricanes.  More generally, tropical convection is an engine of weather and climate worldwide yet poorly understood and difficult to simulate.  Work leading to better representation of tropical convection in weather and climate models can thus lead to better weather forecasts and impact assessments, both for the public and decision makers.  Aside from the societal relevance of the science, the campaign features several education and outreach activities.  These including support for undergraduate participation and production of short documentary videos for use in classroom teaching and informal science education.  In addition, the Principal Investigators (PIs) maintain a blog during the period just before, during, and just after the field campaign, helping to communicate the science to a broader audience.  The award also provides funding for the education of a graduate student and to bring three additional graduate students to the campaign, allowing them to gain valuable experience in fieldwork.<br/><br/>The eight week campaign deployment consists primarily of a set of 20 flights in the Gulfstream V research aircraft maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  The campaign uses an airport in Costa Rica for easy access to the equatorial Pacific and southwest Caribbean study regions, and conditions in these regions are sampled using dropsondes and a wing-mounted W-band radar.  Dropsondes contain the same instrument package as standard weather balloons, only dropped from an aircraft (in this case from about 40,000 feet) with a small parachute.  The radar determines cloud properties such as the relative abundance of ice particles versus liquid droplets, and uses Doppler shift to measure updraft and downdraft speeds in clouds.  The aircraft sampling is augmented by observations collected at ground sites in Costa Rica and Colombia.<br/><br/>Despite intensive study we still lack a satisfactory theory for how environmental conditions determine when and where tropical convection will form, how long it will last, how much it will expand and organize, and how much rain it will produce.  Over the eastern Pacific tropical convection occurs in a narrow east-west strip a few degrees north of the equator, in a region where near-surface winds come together in an intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ).  The near-surface wind convergence is a consequence of a strong north-south sea surface temperature (SST) contrast between the ""cold tongue"" along the equator and the warmer waters to the north. Surface winds near the equator tend to blow across SST contrasts and converge over the warmer water, and surface convergence induces rising motions favorable to convection.<br/><br/>But the PIs argue against the notion that convection in the eastern Pacific ITCZ is driven primarily by surface convergence, pointing out that surface convergence does not automatically result in strong convection and heavy rainfall.  Instead they hypothesize that thermodynamic factors including convective available potential energy (CAPE), convective inhibition (CIN), and the influence of moisture through entrainment and downdrafts are key to understanding convection in the region.<br/><br/>The project also considers convection over the southwest Caribbean, where convection occurs despite a lack of SST contrasts and a relatively dry atmosphere.  The PIs suggest that convection in these unfavorable conditions constitutes a self-sustaining equilibrium state which can develop given the right initial state, although the same environmental conditions would equally favor suppressed convection.  Such multiple equilibrium behavior is seen in idealized models and has been associated with self-aggregation in cloud resolving models, and the PIs hypothesize that it is implicated in the active and suppressed phases of easterly waves.<br/><br/>The research is conducted using data collected during the campaign in combination with a variety of numerical models including a cloud resolving version of the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model.  The PIs have several strategies for representing the relevant dynamics and thermodynamics in an idealized form, often using a small doubly-periodic domain. Observational comparisons use data from OTREC as well as earlier field campaigns (EPIC and TEPPS).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is however less recognized that sea level rise can push water tables above the land surface to flood low-lying depressions. Lakes and wetlands that form by groundwater flooding expose connected aquifers to direct, continuous evaporation, which can result in substantial losses of water resources. Impacts from groundwater flooding and evaporation will be most intense on low-lying carbonate islands, where evaporated freshwater is replaced by seawater that percolates through the bedrock. These models incorporate impact of climate and predicted that lakes should remain fresh, and groundwater resources continuous, beneath islands in humid regions. In arid regions, lakes would be hypersaline, and much fresh groundwater would be replaced by seawater. In contrast to expectations, modern lakes that are formed by groundwater flooding in the arid southern Bahamas islands have salinities that range from fresh to hypersaline. This paradox between modeled and observed lake salinity underscores our lack of understanding of how groundwater flooding impacts island water resources. During this project, new field data will be collected, and new transient modeling tools will be developed, to test the overarching hypothesis that how groundwater flooding will impact island water resources. We will test the impact of lake area relative to its groundwater contributing area, the degree of connectivity between lakes and the ocean, and dynamic interactions with climate and sea level change on this process. The results of this study should improve predictions of freshwater resource loss of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) from groundwater flooding, perhaps the primary environmental factor triggering their loss of habitability. The modeling tools to be developed as part of this project will be freely distributed to the hydrological community. A field hydrogeology curricular exercise, with learning outcomes of quantitative coastal hydrology, will be developed to be used by the more than 100 student groups that visit the Gerace Research Centre (base of operation for this project) each year. Project results will be presented as part of a guest lecturer series at the University of the Bahamas and at international conferences. The project will enhance human resources by introducing coastal hydrology to 2 geology PhD students, and one civil engineering postdoctoral researcher at Michigan Tech. Each PI will work with their institution's diversity office to ensure that these positions are effectively advertised to under-represented groups.<br/><br/><br/>Evaporation of lakes and wetlands that form on islands by groundwater inundation reorganizes groundwater flow paths and lowers water tables. Impacts from groundwater inundation and evaporation will be most intense on low-lying carbonate islands, where the Ghyben-Herzberg relationship results in losses from freshwater lenses (the primary freshwater resource) being 40x the lowering of the water table. Primary controls on groundwater inundation will be sea-level rise and island topography, but impacts to freshwater resources could be moderated by climate (precipitation, and evaporation), aquifer permeability, ratio of groundwater contributing area to lake surface area, and distance between the lake and coast. During this project, new field data will be collected, and new transient modeling tools will be developed, to test the overarching hypothesis that groundwater inundation will reduce freshwater lens volumes through interactions of lake area relative to its groundwater contributing area, degree of connectivity between lakes and ocean, and dynamic interactions with climate and sea level change. Hypothesis testing will take a three-pronged approach. First, DEMs of San Salvador Island, Bahamas, will characterize lake hydrogeological setting (catchment/lake area ratios). Field observations of hydrogeological parameters and weather data will be used to estimate groundwater fluxes and lake evaporation; chemical and isotopic compositions of groundwater, lake water, and precipitation will be used to estimate recharge thresholds and lake water sources (ocean, groundwater, recharged precipitation). Second, a package for simulating dynamic flow and solute transport between lakes and groundwater will be developed and integrated into the SEAWAT/MODFLOW model in cllaboration with USGS. The model will be parameterized with observational data collected on San Salvador Island. Third, transient responses of island freshwater lenses to multiple sea level rise, climate change, and lake formation scenarios will be tested with the newly developed numerical modeling tool. Simulations will determine the nature of relationships between freshwater lens volumes and sea level, climatic variables, and island-lake hydrogeological settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This creates a challenge for countries like Indonesia, which produce significantly fewer trained linguists, yet at least 700 of the estimated 7,000 languages of the world are spoken with its borders.  One innovative, collaborative approach to addressing the training bottleneck in documenting endangered languages is the use of relatively short training workshops that bring together teams with different expertise. This workshop will use conduct a one-week language documentation conference that has the additional benefit of producing documentation on the languages. The focus will be on the endangered languages of Nusa Tenggara Timur, since speakers of these languages have little or no documentary expertise.  The scientific interest of East Indonesian languages includes their relevance to the linguistic history of the region and further documentation and analysis of these languages will have broad implications for the study of two entirely different language families in this biogeographical transition zone between the Asian and Australian continents. U.S. graduate students will gain international field research and training experience, and minority language speakers will be trained in best practices in language documentation and archiving. There will be increased international collaboration opportunities.  Project products include materials supporting language efforts in the communities and the deposit of documentation in the highly regarded PARADISEC archive will increase accessible data on the targeted languages.<br/><br/><br/>This conference focuses on training native speaker documenters, because they are often in a better position to conduct the tasks of documentation, from securing appropriate permissions to arranging recording sessions to transcribing and annotating texts. Languages from two entirely different language families, the Austronesian Central Malayo-Polynesian family, and the non-Austronesian Timor-Alor-Pantar, long assumed to be Trans-New Guinea languages of mainland New Guinea, will be documented during the workshop. Both families share a number of typological features which appear to have diffused across the families, most notably in the system of grammatical possession, both in constituent order and in overtly distinguishing between alienable and inalienable possession, features which are rare in the Austronesian family. On the other hand, the languages often distinguish inclusive vs. exclusive pronouns, a feature common among Austronesian language but rare in the non-Austronesian languages of New Guinea. The training of endangered language speakers to produce, linguistically annotate, and archive quality data will lay the groundwork for further scientific investigation of these and other topics. The resulting documentation will increase scientific knowledge of Eastern Indonesian languages, while also laying the groundwork for future projects in this region, including possible collaborations between the two groups of participants, graduate students and native speaker documenters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An essential part of this effort is determining the sources of trace elements to the oceans, one of which is from the atmosphere: dust falling from the air, and rain, both deliver elements to the sea surface. This project would collect and analyze samples of rainwater and of particles from the atmosphere, along a U.S. GEOTRACES expedition from Alaska to Tahiti in the fall of 2018. The timing of the expedition corresponds to the part of the year with the highest atmospheric dust concentrations in the Gulf of Alaska and may also capture the tail end of peak fire season in Asia. In contrast, the southern end of the proposed ship track is known to have very low atmospheric dust. Aerosols will be influenced by human activity in Asia as well. The anticipated differences in atmospheric deposition along the ship track will allow the assessment of the role of this process on trace element and isotope cycling. The project will support a postdoctoral investigator. The relevance of ocean-atmosphere studies to the public will be communicated at campus open house events and in online forums in collaboration with the GEOTRACES management team.<br/><br/>In alignment with the mission of GEOTRACES, the proposed research will address the following biogeochemical and oceanographic questions: 1) What is the magnitude of atmospheric aerosol deposition (wet and dry) to the surface of the Pacific Ocean? 2) What is the chemical composition of these aerosols and how does composition vary based on source (e.g. Alaskan glacial flour, Asian mineral dust, emissions from biomass burning, anthropogenic emissions)? 3) What is the fractional solubility of trace elements in Pacific aerosols and does solubility vary based on aerosol source? 4) What is the potential bioavailability of soluble aerosol Fe? 5) How is the soluble fraction of aerosol trace elements distributed across operationally defined size classes? 6) How does atmospheric deposition impact distributions of other GEOTRACES parameters? Atmospheric aerosol and precipitation samples will be collected over the 70-day expedition and the investigators will provide sub-samples to collaborators and other interested scientists. These samples will be analyzed for a suite of key trace elements from bulk and size-fractionated aerosol samples, aerosol leachates, and rain samples. A sequential extraction scheme designed to solubilize aerosol Fe as a function of its FeOx morphology and particle size will be used on selected samples because an understanding of aerosol trace element fractional solubility is fundamental to future work to assess the bioavailability of aerosol derived trace elements. The proposed work will provide data that directly contribute to the GEOTRACES objectives related to atmospheric deposition and will help to address temporal variability as this cruise section follows the CLIVAR/Repeat Hydrography P16N line.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Millimeter Wave (mmWave) bands are expected to deliver multi-Gigabit-per-second (Gbps) wireless data rates that will be central to next-generation (5G) cellular networks as well as wireless local networks. Networks using these bands will also enable new applications such as virtual and augmented reality, vehicle-to-vehicle communications, and a surge of multimedia and Internet-of-Things traffic. Millimeter wave technology, however, is fundamentally different from existing wireless technologies such as WiFi and cellular networks due to its physical properties, including directionality, wide bandwidth, and sparsity. As a result, today's mmWave systems face new challenges, in terms of mobility, medium access, and control overhead, which prevent them from scaling and supporting mobile networks. The research proposed in this project will address these challenges to unleash the potential of mmWave technologies. The project will design and build practical, scalable, mobile millimeter-wave networks for next generation communication systems. The project will also integrate mmWave communication into novel applications like virtual reality (VR) and self-driving cars. The proposed research will be disseminated through close collaboration with industry and publication in top research venues. It will also be integrated into education through the design of new undergraduate and graduate wireless classes and involvement in community outreach programs. <br/><br/>The proposal will enable practical, agile and mobile mmWave networks and integrate them into higher layer applications. It will address the above challenges by introducing novel cross-layer protocols that exploit the underlying sparsity of mmWave networks to deliver new protocols that can perform beam alignment, tracking, interference management and scheduling in real-time and with low overhead that allows them to scale to large networks. The proposed research will be executed in three key thrusts: (1) It will develop link establishment protocols that can discover the best alignment between access points and clients and track the client's direction. (2) It will develop new medium access control protocols that will scale mmWave to multi-link networks. (3)  It will integrate mmWave networks into higher layer applications like VR and self-driving cars by developing a joint communication and sensing system.

In emergencies, forecasters predict the transport of ash using numerical models, but they typically assume that particles fall as individuals to simplify the analysis.  In reality, fine ash particles combine together into larger clusters, accelerating their rate of fall.  This allows the ash to fall out of the cloud.  Rates of aggregation depend on many factors, including moisture, electric charge, and turbulence.  There is limited existing data on the effects of these properties, particularly for turbulent flows, even though aggregation affects up to 95% of fallout in some eruptions.  Hence, there is a need for better experimental measurements of aggregation processes, along with more advanced models that include the phenomenon.<br/><br/>This study aims to improve forecasting of volcanic hazards through both high-accuracy experiments and upgraded models.  Ash aggregation will be examined in two different, relevant flow conditions: homogeneous turbulence and high-speed jets.  High-resolution optical techniques will be used to study the flow, turbulence, and particle clustering.

Another lesser-known, non-conventional mode of inheritance is called microchimerism, whereby cells travel between mother and baby during pregnancy, and some colonize and persist for decades after birth. This doctoral dissertation project leverages data from a multigenerational, longitudinal health and nutrition study to investigate microchimerism as a mediating factor in immune tradeoffs throughout the life course. The research aims to better understand how microchimerism may be associated with fetal growth during pregnancy, infant feeding practices, early childhood infectious disease, and pregnancy outcomes in adults. The publicly available data from this longitudinal study and the newly-generated microchimerism data will provide opportunities for student-driven research for undergraduates, including individuals from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Microchimerism is thought to influence host immune function by directly contributing stem cells that differentiate and develop into functional immune cells and expressing foreign antigens that trigger host immune responses. Most microchimerism research has focused on relationships with autoimmune disorders, cancer, transplant biology, and adverse pregnancy outcomes, leaving considerable gaps in understanding why some individuals are colonized by microchimeric cells more than others, and how these differences might impact evolutionary fitness. To clarify these issues, population-based data from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey spanning three generations of participants will be used to investigate the following specific aims: 1) evaluate whether having been breastfed in infancy predicts microchimerism in adulthood, 2) assess whether microchimerism is associated with lower risk of early life infection, and 3) determine whether adult women with microchimerism from their mothers have lower risk of adverse pregnancy outcomes as they have offspring of their own.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Virtual reality is a multidisciplinary field involving human-centered computer simulations that seek to imitate or augment real world senses (usually sight, sound, and touch) and experiences.  VR research includes the development and assessment of methods and systems, and facilitating and understanding user perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors.  First organized by the IEEE Computer Society in 1993 and held annually since 1995, IEEE Virtual Reality is the premier international conference and exhibition in this field and includes technical paper presentations, workshops, tutorials, research demonstrations, and exhibits from industry.  More information about the conference may be found online at http://www.ieeevr.org/2018.  The goal of the Doctoral Consortium is to provide a unique venue for interactive, supportive, and prestigious mentoring for mid-level graduate students in virtual reality, to afford these students a valuable opportunity to get independent perspectives on their research from senior individuals with a wide collective breadth and depth of knowledge, and to build a cohort of young researchers within the VR community.  Due to this year's timing constraints, the 18 DC student participants (including 10 from US educational institutions and 8 from non-US institutions) have already been selected.  Special efforts were made to recruit participants from groups traditionally underrepresented in the field of computer science, including women, persons of color, and people with disabilities.<br/><br/>This year's IEEE VR Doctoral Consortium builds on the successful format of the previous such events, which were also supported by NSF.  The main activities of the DC will take place on Sunday, March 18, in parallel with the first day of IEEE 3DUI.  The workshop will include morning and afternoon sessions in which each student presents his/her work to the other student participants and a panel of senior VR researchers, with sufficient time set aside after each talk for discussion and constructive feedback that addresses the strengths of the work, challenges and issues that may arise, and implications of the results.  A group working lunch attended by all the students and mentors will be particularly valuable for unifying the individual goals and projects presented within the group as part of a ""big picture"" envisioning of the future of the field over the next 10-20 years.  The VR conference will begin the evening of Monday, March 19, with a welcome reception, where DC participants will network with what they have learned during the full day event.  DC attendees will also take part in a poster session, which will give them more opportunities to network and discuss their research.  Additional smaller activities, including a lunch with key leaders in the VR research community, will take place at scattered times over the rest of the week; in particular, small groups of 2-3 students will meet for mentoring lunches and/or other networking events with senior members of the VR community.  The conference organizers will generously provide as much financial support as possible to the DC through the conference's budget, including meeting space, audio-visual rental, and food and beverage during breaks for free.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will test the hypothesis that defects in the production of certain components of the extracellular matrix have profoundly negative consequences for pericyte behaviors and could therefore contribute to their dysfunction in certain diseases. The educational component of this project includes working with STEM education leaders to extend the research goals for the development of activities and lessons for primary and secondary educators to use as ""cross-curricular"" supplemental material. Training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students will also be incorporated, advancing the careers of students interested in gaining research experience and developing independent projects.<br/><br/>The project focuses on elucidating the role of the extracellular matrix (ECM) in mediating pericyte(PC)-endothelial cell (EC) interactions and their role in vascular development and maintenance of blood vessel integrity. The Research Plan is designed to test the hypothesis that proper vascular development and function depend critically on the precise regulation of 1) EC production of collagen IV, and (2) PC synthesis of vitronectin.  More specifically, the Plan includes a) development of in vitro and ex vivo platforms for imaging fixed and live PCs migrating along remodeling extracellular networks, b) establishment of a primary PC cell line that has been functionally validated in addition to standard gene expression profiling, 3) establishment of a multi-scale computational modeling<br/>platform to recapitulate PC migration along developing vessels in the context of a range of collagen IV production rates from ECs and 4) use of other in vivo experimental approaches to achieve two objectives:  1) Elucidate the effect of EC-derived collagen IV on (i) PC migration and investment during vessel development and (ii) PC retention along functional vasculature and 2) Determine the role of PC-derived vitronectin in (i) vascular formation and (ii) maintaining the integrity of mature blood vessels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because companies in the sharing economy span a range of services, and because their platforms have become hugely popular, local actors and organizations are now in a political struggle over the implications for other markets and regulatory policy. Such contentious politics have brought into question the viability of sharing economy platforms as city policymakers consider revising local regulations to accommodate the platforms or in some cases, banning them wholly. Most research on the development of new markets focuses either on the social structures that facilitate a market's emergence or on the politics involved to adapt it to existing norms and rules. This project synthesizes the two different perspectives to examine how one of the largest markets in the sharing economy, the short-term rental or ?home-sharing? sector, develops in the context of other local structures and politics. Findings from this research will show new configurations of power emerging from local sharing economy markets. These findings will also contribute to public conversation and policy discussions on the sharing economy, market regulation, lobbying and municipal government transparency.<br/> <br/>The research combines the richness of qualitative investigation with the scope of computational and quantitative methods. Specifically, it analyzes quantitative data from short-term rental websites, the Census, nonprofit organizations, and hotels for 300 U.S. cities and metropolitan areas. It will also use new and original data collected by the researchers, including a dataset on municipal budgets and short-term rental ordinances as well as interview, historical, and participant observation data from a case study of short-term rentals in Los Angeles. In doing so, it extends scholarly understandings of markets to account for the ways in which the local and organizational contexts in which markets emerge also shape the politics over their regulation. Additionally, it considers the distinct resource and political constituency of sharing economy markets--the crowd--in these processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is responsible for a vast array of geological processes, from the generation of continental crust to the modulation of atmospheric composition. Yet, some fundamental questions about its history remain unresolved: when plate tectonics began on Earth and how it has evolved through time. This project aims to resolve the likely mode of mantle convection in the Precambrian (i.e., after the solidification of the putative magma ocean in the early Earth to the beginning of the Phanerozoic at 540 million years ago), by building a robust theoretical framework and exploring its implications for geological and geochemical observations. Reconstructing the evolutionary path of plate tectonics on Earth is one of the most fundamental geophysical problems, providing a global context for geological, geophysical, and geochemical processes, and the radius of the potential impact of this research would cover nearly all branches of solid Earth sciences. Expected research results should also find their applications in the physics and chemistry of terrestrial planets at large and are expected to become part of the theory of habitable planets. This project will provide support and training for a postdoctoral associate and a graduate student, as well as summer intern or thesis projects for undergraduates.  <br/><br/>The planned research has the following five major objectives: (1) Establishing a regime diagram of mantle convection as a function of internal Rayleigh number, the temperature dependency of viscosity, yielding criteria, and the internal heating ratio, so that we can estimate how the mode of convection has evolved in the past, (2) quantifying the relation between quasi-steady-state solutions and transient situations, in terms of the mode of convection and heat-flow scaling, so that we can analyze collectively different numerical approaches to the evolving mantle dynamics in a unifying fashion, (3) understanding 3-D effects on the mode of mantle convection on the basis of newly-developed scaling laws and published simulation results, (4) exploring the influence of the thermal evolution of the core on surface tectonics by a systematic investigation of coupled core-mantle evolution models, and (5) connecting internal mantle dynamics with surface observables, such as global sea level, plate velocity, and geomagnetic field strength, so that we can build falsifiable hypotheses for the evolution of mantle convection in the Precambrian.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This underrepresentation carries over into important aspects of their professional careers.  For example, women authors tend to publish less frequently in top field journals, find their work cited less frequently, and are often evaluated differently than men across a range of indicators.  This project seeks to identify the set of factors that help to explain why women are underrepresented in political science and to devise a mentoring program to assist women early in their careers.  To do so, they propose to conduct a cohort study of individuals who attended graduate school in the 1990s.  Next, they will administer a survey to learn more about perceptions of scholarly journals and publication success.  Finally, they propose an experimental mentoring program to identify the most effective strategies for promoting success for female scholars in political science. The research team is comprised of a number of successful scholars, most of whom are women, and will have the support of the American Political Science Association in helping to administer the studies and implement the mentoring program.     <br/><br/><br/>This project examines the factors that lead to the significant underrepresentation of tenured women in political science.  The percentage of women with tenure is lower than one would expect given the number of female PhDs and assistant professors.   The proposal sets out to accomplish two things: evaluate factors that hinder the advancement of women in political science and generate evidence-based strategies to develop successful mentoring programs.  A diverse team of accomplished scholars has been assembled to conduct this research.  The project consists of three components.  First, a team will conduct a survey to evaluate respondents' attitudes toward journals and perceptions of success with a particular focus on notable differences across an array of respondent characteristics.  Second, they will conduct a cohort study comprised of individuals who entered graduate school in the 1990s and are currently mid-career scholars.  Third, they will implement a randomized experimental mentoring program to assess the relative success of competing interventions.

High courts are called on to be final arbiters of constitutional meaning. The Kenyan Supreme Court's invalidation of the August 2017 presidential election and directive for a new election in late October 2017 presents a crucial test of the Court's institutional legitimacy, or rightful authority to render constitutional and legal rulings for the polity. This project examines how the public has responded to this landmark ruling, as well as to the new election that the Court has ordered. Do citizens' ethnic and partisan affiliations drive their assessments of the Supreme Court's legitimacy in light of this landmark ruling? Or can perceptions of procedural fairness and other non-policy factors overcome ethnic or partisan bias and build a reservoir of legitimacy for the Court? These questions are incredibly important in an emerging democracy like Kenya with a high court that has a short institutional history. Mass and elite responses to the Court's actions will set a strong precedent for the future of the rule of law and democratic governance, not only in Kenya but in Africa writ large. Moreover, a history of mass public protests and violence in response to controversial elections makes understanding the public's response to this episode extremely important for theoretical, empirical, and normative reasons. <br/><br/>	This project will test theoretical hypotheses centered on process-based (procedural fairness, subscription to democratic values) versus outcome-based (ethnic or partisan disagreement with Court outcomes) models of institutional legitimacy. These hypotheses with a two-wave national panel survey, which includes a survey experiment, of Kenyan citizens. Using an oversample of control group respondents from the first wave, descriptive statistics related to legitimacy and other Court-related assessments and examine the effects of process and outcome-based factors on legitimacy and other evaluations will be generated. A field experiment will also be conducted to allow identification of the causal effects of procedural fairness and elite cues, both countervailing and aligning with ethnopartisan preferences' on Supreme Court legitimacy. The experiment will also examine whether procedural fairness and countervailing elite cues can attenuate ethnopartisan bias in legitimacy judgments. Finally, the second wave survey will allow the identification of how different ethno-partisans' attitudes toward the Supreme Court change in light of the outcome of the new election.  Examining these changes will provide an additional test of the outcome-based model and examine how and whether reactions (both positive and negative) to the court?s decision persist into the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analysis of dementia patients' brains has linked the presence of numerous and wide-spread microinfarcts, in some cases thousands in a single brain, to increased cognitive impairment. Animal studies support this finding. While a causal link has been established, the cellular, molecular, and physiological events that occur during small blood vessel stroke and their role in neurological impairment remain unknown. Performing high-resolution cellular experiments in humans or animal brains is extremely challenging. To overcome this limitation, this project focuses on the development and validation of a tissue-engineered, microfluidic, in vitro, microstroke model that accurately recapitulates the cascade of events that occur in vivo. Development and validation of this fluidized, in vitro, microstroke model has the potential to provide significant insights into the fundamental biological changes induced by microstrokes. It is envisioned that the biological discoveries achieved with this model could significantly impact human health and potentially lead to the development of intelligently designed therapies to treat microstroke and dementia in future applications. To increase exposure across a broad range of students, from elementary to undergraduate, an educational plan has been developed that aims to spark interest in students to pursue science, technology, engineering and math education through Art in Science Exhibits, hands-on Art in Science Modules, laboratory research experiences, as well as to incorporating research in microphysiological systems into existing undergraduate courses.<br/><br/>The project focuses on developing and validating a tissue-engineered, microfluidic, in vitro, microstroke model that can be used to study the cellular, molecular and physiological events that occur during microstroke-induced neurological impairment occlusion- and reperfusion-induced changes.  The model overcomes challenges in performing high-resolution, spatiotemporal cellular/molecular experiments in animal brains.  The Research Plan is organized under 3 specific aims:  1) Quantify the influence of capillary occlusion and reperfusion on cerebrovascular flow in a 3D synthetic, biomimetic, vascular network based on a 3D image stack of the vascular system of an entire mouse brain that was generated by high-resolution imaging, via knife edge scanning microscopy, of perfused india ink; 2) Quantify the influence of capillary occlusion and reperfusion on human stem cell derived brain microvascular endothelial cells (BMECs) and 3) Quantify the influence of capillary occlusion and reperfusion on microinfarct progression by spatiotemparally monitoring the progression of a capillary occlusion- and reperfusion induced microinfarct in hydrogel encapsulated human astrocytes and neurons.  Fulfillment of these aims requires further development and implementation of advanced biofabrication techniques (two-photon hydrogel degradation and polymerization), advanced biomaterials (enzymatically-degradable constructs and semi-synthetic blood clots), and incorporation of differentiated human neural stem cells (BMECs, astrocytes, and neurons) to create a microphysiological ìstroke model using all human cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Introductory calculus is an important course in undergraduate STEM curricula, and the design and teaching enhancements proposed in this project have the potential to increase the retention, graduation, and quality of STEM majors nationwide. The mathematical-modeling approach to differential equations uses best practices in STEM undergraduate teaching: it is hands-on, problem-based, inquiry-driven, and incorporates group learning. The project will create teaching materials that focus on real world data and encourage students to transfer knowledge between mathematics and other disciplines. The project will combine in-person and virtual support for faculty seeking to adopt a mathematical-modeling approach in their own classrooms. This support includes workshops, panel discussions, presentations at regional and national conferences, and mentoring in an online community. The project will support different levels of faculty engagement: some faculty will introduce a few modeling activities into their classes while others will complete a full curriculum shift to mathematical models. Finally, the project will conduct research on the efficacy of specific approaches to faculty development. <br/><br/>The first part of the project will support the development of peer-reviewed, open-source teaching materials that will be made available to the public through SIMIODE's HUBZero platform. The online platform will allow users and authors to share comments, modifications, and extensions of the material. The project will also promote awareness of this modeling approach through dissemination of teaching materials at conferences. Secondly, the project will provide initial and long-term support for faculty development via an online community and in-person workshops.  These workshops will focus on incorporating these materials into courses, thus encouraging a sustained pedagogical shift from technique-driven to a model-driven approach. Summer workshops and annual mini-courses at national conferences will demonstrate the modeling approach to teaching differential equations and will provide in-person mentoring and support to faculty adopting this approach. Throughout the project, the assessment team will review the effectiveness of the online communities and in-person workshops so the program staff can modify them to provide the best support. SIMIODE employs a double-blind peer review of published materials by a Board of Contributing Advisors that includes material authors and users. The Board and participants will also provide feedback on the efficacy of the project's activities in delivering faculty support needed to affect pedagogical change.

This challenge is a direct consequence of the devastating effects that disasters can produce on societies. These effects impact all facets of the socio-technical processes at the core of modern life. Disaster mitigation, preparedness, and response plans must be improved to minimize vulnerabilities, and to ensure that what is known can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of future efforts. Disaster logistics should be a whole-society effort, where the civic and public sectors participate to minimize the negative impacts of disasters. Disaster researchers have already established that the civic society plays a major role in all aspects of the response to extreme events, from search and rescue and relief distribution, to rebuilding efforts. They are often credited with being the first respondents due to their proximity to the impacted area. These groups are a very heterogeneous collection of formal and informal organizations with different structures and levels of expertise in disaster response. Previous field work has also shown that the civic society can provide effective response to their communities by means of leveraging their connections to access logistical resources and efficiently respond to the disaster. Frequently, these groups delivered relief supplies faster, and more effectively, than any of the large relief organizations. On the other hand, the activities of some groups can prove troublesome, such as the gathering of donations of non-priority supplies. The reality is that the majority of the donations that arrive at a disaster site are non-priority goods that severely complicate disaster response efforts. The main goal of this project is to identify lessons, both positive and negative, that the disaster community should learn from the experiences of the civic society during the responses to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Identifying these lessons will help future disaster responders to conduct more effective operations, and reduce the impacts of disasters on local communities, the economy, and the environment. This project studies the socio-technical factors that hamper the integration of Non-Established Relief Groups (NERGs) efforts and that of relief efforts that come from the outside to help. In addition, the research provides crucial knowledge about the role that NERGs play in the humanitarian logistics, and about how best to structure the interactions among the established groups, the official response and the NERGs, for maximum effectiveness. The data collected about the difficulties of relief groups to deliver supplies will help identify mechanisms to prevent these problems from happening in future disasters. The research documents the logistic structures that emerge in support of relief/early recovery efforts after a major extreme event and enable future model development based on these different relief approaches. The findings enhance theoretical understandings of organizations participating in these extreme event environments. <br/><br/>The research focuses on both formal and informal mechanisms through which NERGs identify, gather, deliver, and distribute relief items. Data collection includes short and informal as well as in-depth interviews with individuals involved in the logistics efforts, at all levels of action (e.g., international, national, re-gional, local, and community levels), from NERGs, and at all levels of power. In order to gain better understandings about the motivations behind physical donations, the team creates a directory of donation drives taking place across the US to support the relief efforts. The goal is to conduct longitudinal tracking of their operations, and perform in-depth studies of how these efforts are created, their evolution, and their decision-making patterns. This effort serves as the basis for more in-depth behavioral research. The researchers promote multidisciplinary collaboration, engages undergraduate and graduate students,and disseminate and integrate research findings into disaster courses. Improving humanitarian logistics operations can reduce human suffering and loss of life in disasters<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation project investigates relationships between T and maternal behaviors in free-ranging monkeys. The study of T in relation to motherhood in these non-human primates will contribute to the literature on the hormonal mechanisms of parenting, and provide comparative data for understanding the development of human-like parenting behavior during primate and hominin evolution. The project will facilitate training in STEM fields for undergraduates and graduates, including women from underserved and underrepresented backgrounds. This project will also support research collaborations and public science outreach about human and primate biology and evolution.<br/><br/>This project will investigate the role of T in regulation of maternal care away from the current offspring towards future reproduction, and displays of aggression to other group members who can potentially harm offspring ('maternal aggression'). The investigators will collect longitudinal data on behaviors and physiology from 49 Cayo Santiago rhesus macaque mothers during their first 3 months postpartum, when maternal care steeply decreases in preparation for the reproductive transition to the next offspring, and when maternal aggression towards others is heightened. Advances in field endocrinology, including the measurement of fecal hormone metabolites, will enable the continuous tracking of physiology along with a rich suite of behaviors and provide new methods for future studies.

Without causal information, researchers cannot predict the effects of new interventions, estimate retrospective counterfactuals, and, perhaps more importantly, construct meaningful, in-depth explanations of the phenomenon under investigation. With the unprecedented accumulation of data, the challenge of finding meaningful explanations can be summarized under the rubric of ""data-fusion"" -- namely, deriving a causal interpretation from a combination of experimental and observational studies collected under disparate, non-exchangeable conditions (Bareinboim and Pearl, Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A, 2016). Despite all the recent progress, it is still non-trivial to apply state-of-the-art causal inference methods in many large-scale settings. In particular, the scientist's available knowledge does not always match what the theory expects, and the theory does not accept as input (and generate as output) more relaxed causal specifications. Given the completeness of the theory, these requirements cannot be strictly waived. In reality, however, some researchers continue to make their claims even when the required conditions are not met. There is an increasing recognition throughout the empirical disciplines that many of the scientific findings articulated today are too fragile, incapable of resisting to a more rigorous scrutiny or even being reproduced. The goal of this project is to bridge the gap between the conditions entailed by the theory (which, if followed, would generate robust and scientifically-grounded claims) and the knowledge available at the hands of the scientist. Specifically, the project seeks (1) to characterize the trade-off between the combination of data and background knowledge (scientific theories) available versus the strength of newly hypothesized causal explanations, and (2) to construct approximation schemes allowing inputs that are coarse and imprecise, while generating outputs that are still causally meaningful. The proposed research is expected to offer foundational grounding for most of the data science inferences made today, which will impact the practice of several data-intensive fields that are built on cause-and-effect relationships, including econometrics, education, bioinformatics, and medicine. The project also contains a significant educational component. Similar to the importance of physics and calculus in basic science education in the 20th century, causal inference will be a vital component of the curriculum of undergraduate studies in a modern, data-rich society. The project develops a new educational platform tailored to teaching causal inference concepts, principles, and tools to STEM students. The primary goal of this new platform is to move from acausal claims obtained from pervasive regression-based techniques, as well as vague and self-evident statements such as ""association does not imply causation"", and go towards a more fundamental understanding of the conditions necessary to support causal statements.<br/><br/> The goal of this proposal is to develop a principled framework for approximations in causal inference. There are two possible approximation dimensions, one regarding the input and the other the output of a given problem instance. First, we will develop sufficient and necessary identification conditions to accept as input a model that is not fully specified (e.g., a causal DAG), but only a coarser description of the phenomenon is available. We will further develop effective procedures for determining whether a causal quantity can be approximated from a combination of observational and experimental datasets, given structural knowledge about the underlying data-generating process. The project will further leverage both results to design efficient learning algorithms under the relaxed assumption that the input is just partially specified and the output can be an approximation of the target causal distribution. Finally, we will consider the problem of learning causal explanations when multiple biased datasets are available, including when plagued with selection bias, confounding bias, and structural heterogeneity. The goal is to develop a general algorithmic theory of approximate causal inference that is capable of producing more robust, reproducible, and generalizable causal explanations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multiple drives or multi-drives open a new dimension of research into optimizing their combined performance metrics through energy savings, cost savings, increased reliability, and enhanced performance. Therefore, a hierarchy of controls is essential to coordinate among these drives to maximize these metrics. The project's technical success will be partially assessed through an industrial advisory board, which will be formed to ensure quick transitioning of the proposed research into products in areas of national need. The project also aims at establishing new courses, upgrading existing courses, and participating in curricular undergraduate and graduate activities, to promote electric drives and related application areas of national interest. Under-represented minority students will be recruited to participate in research, educational and outreach activities through existing and new initiatives at the University of Connecticut. A new K-12 outreach program will be established with low-income high-minority-population high schools in the State of Connecticut, with focus on solar powered motor drives. <br/><br/>Technical Description: This project will establish foundations for control, fault diagnosis, fault mitigation, and coordination between multiple motor drives, i.e. multi-drives. It will mainly utilize supervisory and switching control concepts at the local and global drive levels. The research objective at the local drive level is to achieve highly reliable operation by switching between controllers or reconfiguring the drive based on available feedback, sensor signals, and health information. Therefore, different faults in these drives will be diagnosed and mitigated with single algorithms, and techniques to reconfigure and thus extend the lives of these drives will be proposed. These algorithms will also focus on minimizing the dwell time during which a drive remains in failure mode. At the multi-drive global system level, coordination and optimization will address how roles and priorities are shared among these drives to minimize their energy consumption. This will be achieved through discrete-time supervisory control and energy optimization. Results from this research will be integrated in two graduate motor drives courses as well as a graduate certificate course, and in undergraduate senior design projects and a new course. A trained workforce from technicians to graduate students is expected to result from K-12 through graduate educational and outreach programs, especially a new K-12 program with focus on under-represented minority and low-income students who may start a career path in STEM. Publications, theses and dissertations, technical workshops, and seminars will be integral in disseminating this research at local, national, and international levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is hugely significant because these marshes normally gain elevation through sediment accumulation more slowly than local sea level is rising. Because marshes are essentially flat, even a small rise in water level will affect a large area. Ultimately, if the waters remain too deep, marshes will drown and switch to open water, with loss of all ecosystem services and coastal protections they afford. The large amount of sediment that was deposited in January, assuming the marsh grasses can grow through it, will give the areas a boost in elevation, making them more resilient to rising waters. The event occurred when two weeks of extreme cold were followed by higher than normal astronomic tides, combined with a powerful northeast winter storm. During the prolonged cold snap, tidal waters froze to the bottom of creeks and bays, incorporating bottom sediment into the ice, which thickened and trapped more sediment with each successive low tide. When the storm surge occurred, the ice rafts floated up and onto the marsh surface, where they became stranded, eventually melting and leaving the sediment on the marsh. In a normal year, ice-rafting would bring about 5% of the annual inorganic material deposited, but this single storm layer is estimated to be equivalent to 71 years of normal accretion. Such infrequent, high sedimentation ice rafting events may therefore be integral to sustaining marshes in New England (as hurricanes can be to wetlands in the southern US); yet are rarely documented. This project addresses this knowledge gap by mapping the area covered in sediment using aerial photography ground-truthed with measurements of thickness and coverage in the field, to fully quantify the amount of sediment transported onto the marsh and its impact on marsh elevation. In addition to quantifying the importance of winter storm processes to northern marshes, this study will provide insights into marsh restoration strategies, such as artificial elevation building through ""thin layer deposition"" whereby locally-dredged sediment is sprayed on top of the marsh surface to build new marshes or elevate existing marshes. The January 2018 event sedimentation provides a natural laboratory to study how a Spartina patens-dominated high marsh will respond to artificial sedimentation, and what thickness of sediment the marsh can withstand. The study broadens participation in geoscience research, as it is headed by an early-career woman researcher, and also forms an independent research project for an undergraduate student, who will analyze sediment samples, translate field data into maps, and combine these data with the aerial photography to determine the impact of this event. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this study is to assess the extent and volume of the extreme sedimentation event which occurred in January 2018 on the Great Marsh, MA. The researchers will collect measurements of thickness and surface extent of the deposit before the spring grass begins to shoot and obscure its coverage. They will conduct aerial survey mapping to collect ortho-photographs capturing the entire marsh region (~130 km2) at a resolution of 10 cm2 and will use a combination of automated image analysis, manual digitization, and comparison to historical images to map the new ice rafted sediment. Field-based ground-truthing of aerial photos will involve a minimum of eight land to barrier island transects (by foot) across the marsh to map and measure the sediment deposits. Multiple sediment plugs of known volume will be extracted for grain size, organic content and bulk density analysis. Sediment thickness and lateral extent of the deposit, determined from the aerial photographs and field surveys, will allow the researchers to estimate the total volume of sediment deposited during this event, enabling a comparison to known accretion rates. The data collected for this study will provide a record and a baseline for future investigations, including analysis of storm conditions when the ice rafts inundated this marsh, and correlation of vectors of transport to wind direction, water depth and marsh elevation, as well as assessments of grass recovery following the sedimentation event. The work will inform the proposed marsh restoration practice of ""thin layer deposition"", by determining the thickness of introduced sediment layers that can be tolerated by the marsh ecosystem as aids to accretion under accelerating rates of sea-level rise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Communities learn from the experience of disaster but often that learning does not lead to a policy change that reduces risks. Furthermore, communities vary in their capacity to mitigate future disasters. The broader impact of this study is to identify the limits on policy learning about disaster mitigation after a community has experienced a disaster. It is critical to understand why one community may be more vulnerable to a disaster than its neighbor. Hurricane Harvey presents a case for understanding the limits on policy learning after a disaster because of the range of communities it affected across Southeast Texas. Data will be collected using a series of semi-structured interviews over several months with local government officials - mayors, emergency managers and city planners - in communities affected by Hurricane Harvey. The intellectual merit of this project is the use of data collected directly from local government officials on policy learning after a disaster across time.   <br/><br/>This project asks what are the constraints on policy learning after disaster? The central theory of this project is that local governments will attempt to engage in policy learning after a natural disaster but those efforts will not necessarily lead to a policy change that reduces future risk. This theory is based on the idea that the process of policy learning can stall or halt when local governments are assessing information about mitigating natural hazards. This study examines policy learning after disaster in the context of Hurricane Harvey because of the range of communities it impacted across Southeast Texas. It hypothesizes that information is the critical factor for policy learning and that learning can be constrained by (1) the types of sources a community looks to for information, (2) whether the information is credible, (3) whether the local government officials tend to be myopic in how they consider the information. Data will be collected using a series of semi-structured interviews over several months with local government officials?mayors, emergency managers and city planners in communities affected by Hurricane Harvey. Previous studies of policy learning have relied on ex-post analyses of government documents to infer the presence and meaning of policy learning. However, this project will gather data in real time, thereby capturing the decision making process for how information is considered and used.  Furthermore, it allows local government officials who are engaged in the process of policy learning to speak for themselves and their communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses the question: What ideas about fairness underpin an economic system that uses data about individuals and their past behavior to determine who gets what going forward? Economic sociologists have long studied how markets and the people who decide their contours, like business leaders and regulators, institutionalize certain understandings of good and bad, of legitimate and inappropriate. Over time, these ideas about how markets should operate become taken-for-granted assumptions that seem natural and obvious, but when market practices are new, these ideas are not yet settled on. By studying the big data economy in its early years, this project seeks to capture how certain ideas about market fairness are becoming accepted?and others are being left aside. <br/><br/>To understand these dynamics, the project focuses on the case of car insurance pricing and leverages a series of U.S. policy debates to study how market actors?including companies, regulators, and consumers?morally frame the use of personal data in insurance pricing. The project also studies how different moral frames enable or deflect the use of various types of information, such as credit scores, social media posts, and real-time driving data. The project draws from policy and industry documents, in-depth interviews, and ethnographic observations at insurance conferences to analyze how different ways of construing fairness lead to different business practices and policy outcomes. To complement these data, the project includes a survey of American consumers to understand the moral intuitions of the people whose lives are affected by these policies and practices. With this analysis, the project contributes to economic sociology?s morals and markets literature and burgeoning efforts to understand the practices of mass data collection, predictive analytics, and algorithmic decision-making, which increasingly give markets their shape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ignoring this uncertainty typically leads to inferior solutions that perform poorly in practice due to the notorious flaw of averages, whereby plans based on the assumption that average conditions pre-vail are usually wrong. These decision problems are often also dynamic in nature they span across multiple time stages and involve high dimensional non-anticipative recourse decisions which further increase the problem complexity. Thus, effective and efficient solution schemes for these decision problems are highly desirable. Traditional solution schemes, however, suffer from the curse of dimensionality and are extremely challenging to solve. Recent advances in distributionally robust optimization (DRO) have been successful in mitigating the intractability of various single-stage decision problems under uncertainty. In DRO, we seek a decision that performs best in view of the most adverse distribution of uncertain parameters that is consistent with the available statistical and structural information. Thus, DRO not only improves computational tractability but also alleviates the overfitting effects characteristic of the traditional solution schemes. By leveraging and inventing new techniques in DRO, the proposed research work aims to significantly advance the state-of-the-art methodologies for addressing the challenges of dynamic decision problems and to initiate the effort for industrial-size applications. The research outputs of this work will have a significant and immediate practical impact on important applications in energy, engineering, machine learning, operations management, finance, etc., and on learning problems in robotics and automatic control. This CAREER work will also advance the state of pedagogy by developing an integrated curriculum that bridges the gap between the deep theory of decision-making under uncertainty and the real-life practice. The proposed curriculum is aimed at future practitioners and researchers, and is designed to equip these experts with the analytical skills and tools to deal with real-life decision-making problems under uncertainty.<br/><br/>The proposed research work is aimed at addressing a major gap in the theory and practice of decision-making under uncertainty. It concentrates on four main research thrusts: 1) Derive exact mixed-integer conic programming (MICP) reformulations for convex dynamic problems as well as for dynamic problems with discrete decisions 2) Deal with the case of endogenous uncertainty whose representation depends explicitly on the chosen decisions 3) Systematically integrate data into the description of uncertainty. Obtain provable out-of-sample performance guarantees from the resulting data-driven DRO models 4) Derive exact MICP reformulations for inverse optimization problems in the dynamic setting. The proposed research effort endeavors to develop more powerful solution schemes which leverage standard off-the-shelf MICP solvers for various intractable decision-making problems under uncertainty. The work will establish a new connection between generic dynamic DRO models and renowned classes of mixed-integer conic programs. The resulting connection will give us a better understanding of the inherent difficulty of the decision problems and enable us to derive attractive performance guarantees for the new solution schemes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research furthers the study of complex systems by introducing a new framework that improves our understanding of the mechanisms that govern decision-making under social influence. Advancing complex systems theory in this way greatly enhances the ability to predict when crowds will provide accurate decision-making support for complex problems and when they will fail miserably.

The planned work will result in developments that make collective intelligence detection tools practical by providing early warning signs of shared misconceptions. <br/><br/>To attain these goals, the research will apply a general framework that incorporates (1) network models that help understand the social processes that lead to observed decision patterns; (2) machine learning tools that draw from uncovered processes to identify signals that optimize the accuracy of collective judgment; and (3) evaluation testbeds that use simulation tools in addition to rich high-dimensional, real-world data about the various stages and performance of group decisions.  This research will contribute to societally-relevant outcomes, including: (a) understanding decision-making in online investment and lending settings to enhance the economic growth of underserved market segments; (b) generating novel knowledge about the performance benefits of collective judgment, and (c) quantifying the link between limited opinion diversity and crowd misconceptions.

In addition, the project will explore the potential for improving the effectiveness of the catalytic materials by synthesizing them as nanoparticles rather than traditional micron-sized particles.  The new materials can be formed through combinations of many different elements, and the study will also develop methods for predicting the best combinations of elements for specific chemical reactions, thereby streamlining the catalyst discovery process and promoting U.S. competitiveness in the fuels and chemicals manufacturing sectors.  The project will be linked to educational and outreach efforts that will train the next generation of engineers, and increase public awareness of new energy-efficient technologies such as fuel cells and batteries.<br/><br/>Preliminary efforts in the investigator's laboratory have established a working understanding of how supported nanoparticle intermetallic compounds (IMCs) may be synthesized with well-defined bulk and surface compositions.  The project will utilize those findings to enable a systematic study of IMC surface chemistry as a function of constituent elements in the selective hydrogenation of unsaturated aldehyde and nitro compounds. Experimental and computational methods will be used to examine the selectivity of C=C, C=O, and N-O activation, dissociation, and hydrogenation as a function of IMC bulk and surface composition and electronic structure information.  Synthesis of oxide-supported non-noble metal nanoparticle IMCs will focus on developing clear understanding of the physical phenomena that dictate their bulk and surface composition as a function of element selection, oxide choice, and preparation environment. Formation of the bulk crystal structure of the nanoparticles will be investigated by ex- and in-situ x-ray diffraction and neutron scattering. Complementary high-resolution energy-dispersive x-ray spectroscopy will verify bulk composition and quantify elements not incorporated into the IMC nanoparticles. Surface composition of the IMCs will be analyzed using low energy ion scattering. Diffusion of constituent elements, particle growth, and bulk crystal structure will be analyzed as a function of synthesis variables to produce a complete picture of how well-defined nanoparticle IMCs may be produced. Results of these studies will allow for a general procedure to be developed for the synthesis, characterization, reactivity evaluation, and stability analysis of the IMC catalysts.  Beyond the targeted reactions, the project will enable atomic- and electronic-level understanding of how nanoparticle IMC catalysis can be controlled and widely utilized in chemical transformations important to the field of heterogeneous catalysis. The educational component of the proposed program will serve to develop a surface and materials chemistry education program at the University of Tennessee, Knoxville.

Recent studies show that these courses often promote the fixed mindset, or the belief that programming aptitude is an inborn trait. Psychology research shows that students with the fixed mindset view mistakes as indications of low ability and perform poorly in the face of challenge. In contrast, students with the growth mindset believe that programming aptitude is malleable and excel when challenged. This project aims to design, build, and evaluate programming tools that help students develop the growth mindset by automatically detecting and praising good learning behaviors as students write code. This research will contribute scientific knowledge about the growth mindset in the domain of computer science and provide insights about the process of learning to program. The project team will deploy the tools to hundreds of students at their own university and release them for free online for any student or teacher to use. If successful, this intervention has the potential to improve the experiences, skills, and diversity of students who successfully complete programming courses and go on to participate in employment and research in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a new growth mindset intervention that leverages the programming environment by using artificial intelligence techniques to automatically detect and praise good learning processes in real time. Programming environments provide a unique opportunity to track and understand student learning behaviors, and offer a scalable environment for praising good practices automatically. By exposing and praising the learning process, this intervention will teach students to attribute their successes and failures to malleable learning processes, rather than an innate aptitude for computer science. This research will be conducted in two phases. First, the project team will develop heuristics that detect good learning processes using behavioral log data, leveraging the computer science education literature and studying the behavior of fixed and growth mindset students to identify good processes.

Ubiquitination is a modification of proteins with a number of biological functions including signaling. For example, when DNA is damaged, ubiquitination plays a critical role in activating specific response pathways to initiate DNA damage repair.  A newly developed quantitative chemical proteomics approach is  applied to reveal just how this takes place. Experimental studies are expected to identify novel ubiquitination-dependent regulatory mechanisms and find previously unknown enzymatic activities in DNA damage response. During the project, undergraduate biochemistry students train with interdisciplinary techniques in chemical synthesis and quantitative proteomics through a fully integrated chemical proteomic training program. Additional outreach programs promote biochemistry education for high school students through specifically designed field learning activities.<br/><br/>The research projects integrate the new isotope-encoded stoichiometry analysis method and chemical proteomics strategies to functionally dissect ubiquitination signaling pathways. Compared to the traditional relative quantification, this approach enables site-specific absolute quantification of ubiquitination prevalence and, therefore, allows the identification of ubiquitination targets that are stoichiometrically activated in specific biological processes. This strategy is applied to determine the dynamic activation of ubiquitination signaling during DNA double-strand break. Temporal dynamics analysis and functional validation reveal key regulatory ubiquitination targets that are critical for the activation of specific response pathways. In vitro and in vivo quantitative analysis determine the substrate dynamics and specificities of important ubiquitination E3 ligases in double-strand break and repair. Overall, these studies provide mechanistic insights into the ubiquitination-mediated signaling and regulatory pathways in DNA damage and response.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the current effects of glacier retreat on water supply in these regions can shed light on future water security threats in snow and ice-covered mountainous watersheds worldwide.  Glaciers are the ""water towers"" of the mountains: they store ice during wet periods and gradually release meltwater during dry periods. However, whether groundwater aquifers serve as extended reservoirs and whether plants also take up significant glacial meltwater remain unresolved questions.  These uncertainties make it difficult to predict the future reliability of water supply in mountainous watersheds, as glacier melt first accelerates and then eventually disappears, and as plants move to higher elevations in response to warming temperatures.  This project will develop a new and general computational watershed model that will incorporate chemical and isotopic data for tracing water flow source regions, as well as measurements from innovative low-cost, open-source environmental monitoring technologies. Results from the model can inform communities that rely on stream discharge from ice and snow-covered mountainous watersheds about present with regard to future water resources vulnerabilities, and can facilitate adaptation strategies as glacier retreat accelerates. <br/><br/>	The recession of glaciers will curtail their ability to modulate river discharge and its variability. Studies of this hydrologic consequence typically classify meltwater and groundwater as distinct contributors to streamflow, but this oversimplifies the potentially complex relationships among glaciers, their underlying groundwater systems, and ecohydrologic pathways. The investigators propose to assess these relationships using an integrated data-model approach in four rapidly changing, glacierized Ecuadorian watersheds, two each at Volcán Chimborazo and Volcán Cayambe. This work will produce a new isotope-enabled watershed model with reactive transport, to which data assimilation will be introduced in order to condition uncertain simulations in data-sparse watersheds with robust environmental tracers.  Open-source data loggers and sensors for measuring model input data will further advance critical-zone process understanding beyond data-intensive sites to remote settings that are undergoing some of the most rapid environmental change in the world.  This work will shed light on less-studied volcanic ranges that potentially facilitate greater infiltration of meltwater through their fractured bedrock, as well as expand the established water-resources focus on glacier retreat to also consider vegetation shift when examining the hydrologic response of glacierized mountainous watersheds to glacier retreat.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This challenge is a direct consequence of the devastating effects that disasters can produce on societies. These effects impact all facets of the socio-technical processes at the core of modern life. Disaster mitigation, preparedness, and response plans must be improved to minimize vulnerabilities, and to ensure that what is known can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of future efforts. Disaster logistics should be a whole-society effort, where the civic and public sectors participate to minimize the negative impacts of disasters. Disaster researchers have already established that the civic society plays a major role in all aspects of the response to extreme events, from search and rescue and relief distribution, to rebuilding efforts. They are often credited with being the first respondents due to their proximity to the impacted area. These groups are a very heterogeneous collection of formal and informal organizations with different structures and levels of expertise in disaster response. Previous field work has also shown that the civic society can provide effective response to their communities by means of leveraging their connections to access logistical resources and efficiently respond to the disaster. Frequently, these groups delivered relief supplies faster, and more effectively, than any of the large relief organizations. On the other hand, the activities of some groups can prove troublesome, such as the gathering of donations of non-priority supplies. The reality is that the majority of the donations that arrive at a disaster site are non-priority goods that severely complicate disaster response efforts. The main goal of this project is to identify lessons, both positive and negative, that the disaster community should learn from the experiences of the civic society during the responses to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Identifying these lessons will help future disaster responders to conduct more effective operations, and reduce the impacts of disasters on local communities, the economy, and the environment. This project studies the socio-technical factors that hamper the integration of Non-Established Relief Groups (NERGs) efforts and that of relief efforts that come from the outside to help. In addition, the research provides crucial knowledge about the role that NERGs play in the humanitarian logistics, and about how best to structure the interactions among the established groups, the official response and the NERGs, for maximum effectiveness. The data collected about the difficulties of relief groups to deliver supplies will help identify mechanisms to prevent these problems from happening in future disasters. The research documents the logistic structures that emerge in support of relief/early recovery efforts after a major extreme event and enable future model development based on these different relief approaches. The findings enhance theoretical understandings of organizations participating in these extreme event environments. <br/><br/>The research focuses on both formal and informal mechanisms through which NERGs identify, gather, deliver, and distribute relief items. Data collection includes short and informal as well as in-depth interviews with individuals involved in the logistics efforts, at all levels of action (e.g., international, national, re-gional, local, and community levels), from NERGs, and at all levels of power. In order to gain better understandings about the motivations behind physical donations, the team creates a directory of donation drives taking place across the US to support the relief efforts. The goal is to conduct longitudinal tracking of their operations, and perform in-depth studies of how these efforts are created, their evolution, and their decision-making patterns. This effort serves as the basis for more in-depth behavioral research. The researchers promote multidisciplinary collaboration, engages undergraduate and graduate students,and disseminate and integrate research findings into disaster courses.

Therefore, immigrants who do not qualify for mandatory detention are enrolled in the Intensive Supervision Appearance Program (ISAP), which enforces the use of a Global Position System (GPS) ankle monitor. We know that some U.S. immigration policies are associated with immigrant ill health, but scant research exists on how being visually marked and placed under constant surveillance affects physical and mental health as well as health care access.

Although these people are no longer in detention, they are still under surveillance via the ankle monitors.

The potential for machine learning to dramatically impact and change people's lives necessitates that machine learning methods be robust, explainable, and understandable---rather than black-box. This research develops new techniques that are both computationally motivated and theoretically sound for robust machine learning at scale. The work is situated in the context of three modern classes of applications. (1) Economists are interested in analyzing the efficacy of microcredit, small loans to individuals in impoverished areas with the goal of eliminating poverty. (2) Biologists are interested in using single-cell RNA sequencing data to understand cells' relationships and development trajectories. (3) The Internet of Things (IoT) is poised to generate a wealth of complex data across energy readings in buildings, within transportation infrastructure, from vehicles on the road, and from many other sensor sources. The PI is working directly with area experts so as to have immediate, broad impact across application domains. In an educational component of the project, the PI is a core part of developing a new graduate curriculum and degree in statistics, data science, and statistical machine learning at MIT. The methods and applications in this proposal feature in a new course on modern machine learning methods. The PI is also developing a high-school level introduction to machine learning as part of the established Women's Technology Program (WTP).<br/><br/>The issues of robustness and explainability particularly arise in domains with nontrivial spatial and temporal dependencies, where the amount of data is often massive, and where practitioners typically have some expert knowledge about the domain before engaging with a particular dataset. These are precisely the domains where existing machine learning methodologies are less well-developed. The need to bring structural knowledge to bear on the problem suggests the use of Bayesian methods, which can incorporate this knowledge via prior and modeling assumptions. To live up to the promise of these methods, though, practical approaches need to be robust to assumptions as well as to noisy or adversarial data, lest this data change important decisions in ways not understood by the practitioner. This research incorporates advances in statistical physics to assess the sensitivity of a data analysis to assumptions and data values. And to realize the advantages of the proposed robust and understandable machine learning framework, practitioners must face extreme scalability issues---both from a computational perspective as well as a modeling perspective. On the computational side, this research builds on recent advances from computational geometry to scale to data sets at modern sizes. On the modeling side, note that while small-scale problems exhibit dense spatio-temporal dependencies, large-scale problems tend to be sparser, and practical approaches must reflect this sparsity to be reliable at scale. This work incorporates advances in probability theory to model sparse IoT networks. This proposal is highly interdisciplinary---bringing together ideas from machine learning, statistics, physics, theoretical computer science, probability theory, and systems and applying these ideas to microcredit, single-cell RNA sequencing, sensor networks, international trade, and industrial applications including customer service at scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All cells are coated in a sugar-rich coating of long molecules called a glycocalyx.  The glycocalyx changes dramatically in many lethal diseases, but little is known about how changes in this cell coating make a disease better or worse.  This project will create new tools for precision engineering of the mechanical properties of the glycocalyx.  They will be used to determine the role of glycocalyx in cell migration.  Cell migration is crucial in how many diseases progress.  For example, the results of the project could lead to new approaches to preventing the spread of metastatic cancer cells.  The tools for glycocalyx engineering are expected to be applied broadly in biotechnology to generate protective and anti-adhesive coatings on cells for diverse applications, including cell-based therapies and cellular production systems for bio-manufacturing. Therefore, results from this research will be important beyond basic research.

Recent studies emphasize that cells can migrate independent of integrins in 3D environments, where the glycocalyx is believed to provide traction against the extracellular matrix (ECM) for propulsion.  Despite the growing appreciation for the role of the glycocalyx in cell migration and mechanotransduction, our overall physical understanding of the structure and its precise mechanisms of action in cell motility remain primitive.  The research will address this challenge through development of a new toolkit for precision engineering of the glycocalyx and application of the toolkit, along with nanoscale imaging approaches, to understand the physical function of the glycocalyx in cell migration.  The research will test the specific hypothesis that the glycocalyx provides physical cues that direct acquisition of specific migration phenotypes in confined 3D environments.

Global costs of rapid sea-level rise to infrastructure (e.g., houses, roads, farms, ports) are likely to be large.  A possible source of water for sea-level rise is the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, and Thwaites Glacier in particular.  Ice sheets and glaciers contain vast quantities of water (in the form of ice) that is continually shed to the ocean, and continually replenished by snowfall (from water that evaporates from the oceans).  If the amount of ice that Thwaites Glacier loses to the ocean over the next decades is much greater than the amount it receives as snowfall, then sea level in all the world's oceans would rise, possibly as much as a meter (approximately 3 feet).  In order to estimate how likely such a catastrophic scenario would be, we need to better understand the surface over which Thwaites Glacier slides.  If we can better characterize that layer (""is to smooth? Is it rough? Is it soft? Is it hard?""), then computer models of Thwaites would be much improved and we can make better projections of the amount of ice that Thwaites Glacier would shed to the ocean.<br/><br/>The objectives of the project are to learn whether basal conditions allow for rapid retreat of the Thwaites Glacier grounding line or whether retreat may re-stabilize near its current grounding line. These objectives will be achieved by using dedicated ice-flow modeling to guide targeted field surveys and experiments over two seasons, and to measure the most important unknown quantities and incorporate them into the models. Numerical models will be used to generate hypotheses for basal conditions that are testable through geophysical surveys and to project future behavior of Thwaites Glacier after assimilating the resulting data. The geophysical methods include seismic, radar, gravity, and electrical surveys that together will allow for a fuller characterization of the bed.

Using declassified documents from the National Archives in College Park, as well as several Presidential Libraries, the project will produce an updated historical narrative of the end of Bretton Woods. There are three objectives: 1) to extend the most current theories of institutional change to address the dynamics of policymaking processes; 2) to articulate a mechanism by which economic policy decisions capitalize on public perceptions of crisis; and 3) to contribute an update social science history of the end of Bretton Woods. These objectives will be reached through process-tracing to make causal inferences based on complex sequences of events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project studies new, more powerful linear algebraic structures and algorithms that exploit these new structures. Given the fundamental importance of these algorithms, ideas generated from this project are expected to be implemented in widely deployed machine learning systems.

Understanding the current effects of glacier retreat on water supply in these regions can shed light on future water security threats in snow and ice-covered mountainous watersheds worldwide.  Glaciers are the ""water towers"" of the mountains: they store ice during wet periods and gradually release meltwater during dry periods. However, whether groundwater aquifers serve as extended reservoirs and whether plants also take up significant glacial meltwater remain unresolved questions.  These uncertainties make it difficult to predict the future reliability of water supply in mountainous watersheds, as glacier melt first accelerates and then eventually disappears, and as plants move to higher elevations in response to warming temperatures.  This project will develop a new and general computational watershed model that will incorporate chemical and isotopic data for tracing water flow source regions, as well as measurements from innovative low-cost, open-source environmental monitoring technologies. Results from the model can inform communities that rely on stream discharge from ice and snow-covered mountainous watersheds about present with regard to future water resources vulnerabilities, and can facilitate adaptation strategies as glacier retreat accelerates. <br/><br/>	The recession of glaciers will curtail their ability to modulate river discharge and its variability. Studies of this hydrologic consequence typically classify meltwater and groundwater as distinct contributors to streamflow, but this oversimplifies the potentially complex relationships among glaciers, their underlying groundwater systems, and ecohydrologic pathways. The investigators propose to assess these relationships using an integrated data-model approach in four rapidly changing, glacierized Ecuadorian watersheds, two each at Volcán Chimborazo and Volcán Cayambe. This work will produce a new isotope-enabled watershed model with reactive transport, to which data assimilation will be introduced in order to condition uncertain simulations in data-sparse watersheds with robust environmental tracers.  Open-source data loggers and sensors for measuring model input data will further advance critical-zone process understanding beyond data-intensive sites to remote settings that are undergoing some of the most rapid environmental change in the world.  This work will shed light on less-studied volcanic ranges that potentially facilitate greater infiltration of meltwater through their fractured bedrock, as well as expand the established water-resources focus on glacier retreat to also consider vegetation shift when examining the hydrologic response of glacierized mountainous watersheds to glacier retreat.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To that end, this project will conduct a number of experiments to address two key questions that link visualization design to cognition.  The first question addresses how different techniques for visualizing the same data affect people's ability to carry out common analysis tasks, as well as how the designs affect their visual perception of and attention to different aspects of the data.  The second focuses on the kinds of conceptual models people form about a dataset when they explore it using different visualization designs, and how visual and interactive elements of the designs affect those models.  Developing better understandings of how people reason with visualizations will advance both cognitive psychology and visualization design.  Students studying information visualization will be involved in the research, directly benefiting their design abilities and having potential benefits in domains where visualizations are becoming increasingly common, including journalism, education, business, and medicine. <br/><br/>To address questions of how visual and spatial elements of a given design affect attention and task performance, the project team will first create a taxonomy of the visuo-spatial properties of common visualizations based on existing research scattered across a variety of academic disciplines, mapping visualization features to their ability to support various analysis tasks such as comparison, interpretation, ranking, and categorization.  They will validate and extend the taxonomy through a series of experiments that look at time spent, error rates, eye gaze data, and qualitative participant feedback to triangulate conclusions about how different designs support observations and inferences over the data and which kinds of visualizations provide observational advantages for which kinds of tasks.  The project team will design a series of analysis tasks that emphasize different cognitive processes derived from both Bloom's taxonomy and different types of knowledge (factual, conceptual, and procedural) in order to conduct experiments that get at the kinds of mental models people form when using different visualization designs.  Participants in these experiments will be given time to explore the visualizations, then perform the tasks using a think-aloud protocol while the project team collects eye gaze data.  Participants will then be asked to reflect on their analysis activities through a series of interviews, and draw a series of representations of the data that capture different sorts of relationships that might compose a mental model.

They preserve well in the fossil and archaeological records, and contain a great deal of information about diet, environment, growth and development, and relatedness among populations or species.  However, the underlying biological processes influencing diversity in tooth form have yet to be fully established. This project uses dental cast samples and family genealogies from diverse bioregional samples to better understand the factors that influence the expression of shape characteristics on an individual tooth, among teeth within an individual's dentition, and among human populations. The findings from this project will advance knowledge about how tooth formation is shaped by genes, development, and childhood environment. The investigators will create an archive of high resolution 3D tooth scans and anonymized genealogies that will be hosted online and made freely available to a global network of scholars. This archive will enhance the research and educational infrastructure for not only biologists and anthropologists, but also clinical dentists, orthodontists, and forensic odontologists who conduct primary research in applied fields. Additionally, the work supports undergraduate and graduate student training at Arizona State University, a diverse and inclusive environment with a high representation of Hispanic and Native American students.<br/><br/>This research uses measurements and observations on the crests, cusps, and furrows that characterize mammalian tooth crowns. Despite their use by numerous scholars across diverse fields, we still do not fully understand how the process of tooth formation is genetically controlled and how different teeth within the dentition are integrated with respect to developmental processes that include both genetic and non-genetic factors. In this project, 150-250 observations will be collected from each of approximately 3,000 individuals from five samples representing distinct modern human populations. Quantitative genetic analyses will be used to estimate the relative contribution of genes and environment in determining variation in tooth size and shape (heritability). Estimates of genetic correlation (pleiotropy) among dimensions and shape variables will define how an organism forms similar tissues (teeth) at different times (in-utero versus early childhood) under the same developmental program and with input from overlapping genetic factors. These estimates will be compared across the five populations to assess whether a general human pattern is evident, and if not, to determine what factors explain disparities between populations. Results will yield insights into how researchers can use dental data as a genetic proxy measure, with an emphasis on the use of teeth from archaeological or forensic contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Results from this work are expected to reveal how the interactive effects between the underlying background state of the Pacific and individual El Niño/La Niña events have changed over the longer context of Earth's climate history. Thus, enhanced knowledge of Pacific decadal variability and its historical effects on both global and regional climate will help guide precautionary efforts taken to ameliorate their anticipated economic and societal impacts in the future. This team of researchers continuously and consistently disseminate their research results through the Education and Outreach Program at The Ohio State University's Byrd Polar and Climate Research Center, dedicated to providing climate information to students, the public and policymakers at all levels. In addition, this project provides support, training, and mentoring for a female postdoctoral researcher representing the next generation of the scientists in this field.<br/><br/>Pacific Ocean surface temperatures oscillate between warm and cold phases every few decades, and these multi-decadal shifts in the background state of the Pacific Ocean affect both regional and global climate. On the regional scale, the underlying warm or cold background state of the Pacific Ocean modulates how individual El Niño/La Niña events affect temperature and precipitation in specific areas. To better predict the impacts of El Niño events on global climate, it is essential to know the background state of the Pacific Ocean. However, our current understanding of this behavior is limited due to relatively short modern instrument observational records. Thus, other methods, such as modeling and/or the use of paleoclimate proxy data, are often used to define Pacific Ocean temperatures prior to the instrumental period. The key goal of this project is to establish a history of Pacific decadal variability and its global climatic influences for the past millennium using a combination of global climate model simulations and readily available ice core records from four different regions around the Pacific Basin. Each ice core provides records of local to global scale climate primarily through annual layer thicknesses (accumulation), stable water isotopic ratios (temperature), and concentrations of both insoluble dust and major anions and cations (atmospheric chemistry). Each record provides distinct insights on precipitation and temperature which will be used to reconstruct the history of basin-wide Pacific variability. The model simulations will serve to improve interpretation of the ice core data and advancing the understanding of underlying mechanisms driving the observed ice core responses to Pacific climate variability. The use of the ice core records also helps evaluate and possibly enhance model capabilities to physically represent critical processes responsible for local climate variability across the Pacific.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Undergraduate students are quite capable of performing tangible research, given the right motivation, facilities, mentoring, and guidance. Moreover, participation in active research can greatly enhance their educational experience and can be effective in motivating them to graduate studies. The proposed theme encompasses innovative and novel topics that can help PWD meet barriers of different kinds - attitudinal, architectural, and technological - in accessing employment, navigating public spaces, freely communicating, and living independently. Our REU program is a summer-long research experience for 10 carefully selected participants. The program includes close mentoring that will provide participants with a balance between technology research focus and grounding in pragmatic aspects that shape PWD's lives and assistive applications. The program also encompasses five weeks of intensive training in scientific research techniques and the technical areas, followed by five weeks of instruction in broader aspects of computer coding, technical writing, presentation skills, and aspects of a graduate career. The proposed innovative theme will excite students intellectually, as well as supporting their passion and creativity.<br/><br/>People who have disabilities make up one of the largest minorities in the world. The World Health Organization estimates as many as 975 million of those 15 years of age and older live with disabilities. For PWD, AT can create a positive influence by removing or reducing many barriers. AT include devices, systems, equipment, and software that make inclusive environments possible and thereby allow PWD to participate fully in society. Through close and frequent interactions between faculty and participants, the proposed theme of AT will expose participants to innovative and novel inter-disciplinary projects through research and prototyping. In the proposed REU program of CSE at UTA, participants will work on computer programming, algorithms, sensors, data analytics, machine learning, and as well as other aspects of basic and applied computer science and engineering. The prototype projects undertaken by REU participants, even though small in nature, will contribute towards inventive methods, techniques, systems, and apps by enhancing the fundamental knowledge base in related fields, while creating new avenues for cross-disciplinary research. By incorporating an important theme of AT in the diversity-rich UTA environment, we expect to increase the pool of diverse and talents students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Automorphic forms play a central role in number theory and related areas, including the proof of Fermat's Last Theorem. The AFW provides a setting for researchers to discuss new developments, learn from other researchers, and begin new collaborations. Many researchers in automorphic forms give their first research talks at the AFW, and many senior researchers attend as well. The workshop has historically also sparked research collaborations leading to new developments in the field. To increase accessibility to a wider audience, the organizers have introduced a ""bootcamp"" to be held March 18th. <br/><br/>Due in part to the location of the conference just outside Boston, the 32nd Automorphic Forms Workshop will attract active researchers for whom attendance at other recent AFWs was impractical because of geographical constraints, time constraints, or lack of sufficient funding. This will ensure that a mix of attendees will contribute new perspectives to the workshop, which also attracts attendees who have participated annually for many years. Typically, about half of the attendees at the AFW are at early stages of their careers, and about one-quarter to one-third of the participants are women. The AFW will continue to provide a supportive and encouraging environment for giving talks, exchanging  ideas, and beginning new collaborations.  In addition to research talks, the AFW will have two professional development panels on topics such as proper mathematical writing, starting a tenure track job, forming collaborations, and transitioning from one career stage to the next. The organizers are committed to continuing to facilitate an inclusive, vertically integrated environment; to this end they are introducing a bootcamp to enhance the experience of early-career researchers attending the workshop.

The amount of water stored in snow, or snow water equivalent (SWE), depends on its depth and density, both of which vary in space and time. New technologies permit mapping of snow depth across large watersheds, but there is no similar advance for measuring snow density. Instead, snow density models are used, but different models can yield divergent results across mountain landscapes. Therefore, understanding why snow density models differ is essential for reducing uncertainty in SWE. This project will improve knowledge of the physical processes that affect snowpack density, focusing on how forests yield predictable variations in snowpack density across watersheds. The project will advance snow density modeling and thus predictions of SWE, snowmelt, and runoff. Snow density models will be used to transform snow depth datasets into SWE datasets, benefiting hydrologic research. The project will train one graduate student, develop two field classes, and support multiple undergraduate interns at the university and through programs that strives to increase diversity in geoscience students.<br/><br/>Spatial variations in snowpack density are driven primarily by differential compaction due to the mass of overlying snow - density tends to increase with greater snow depth. In contrast, secondary processes lead to increased density as depth decreases (e.g., wind compaction) or decreased density as depth increases (e.g., new snowfall). The guiding hypothesis is that landscape properties and climate govern the relative importance of primary and secondary densification processes. Snow in open areas is typically deeper than in forests, so snowpack density is predicted to be greater in open areas. However, secondary processes can enhance or counteract this effect, depending on environmental factors. Hypotheses that assess the roles of primary and secondary densification effects will be tested using coordinated field investigations and modeling experiments. Field investigations in distinct snow climates with landscape controls (e.g., forest vs. open) will measure differences in snow density, depth, water content, and layer characteristics. Snowpack will be simulated with process-based modular snow models and reference models. Field data will be used to quantify model errors, evaluate model representation of primary and secondary effects, and test model sensitivity to meteorological uncertainty. Models will be further evaluated using data from the NASA SnowEx campaign and the second Snow Model Intercomparison Project. Robust models identified will be applied to produce datasets of density, SWE, and uncertainty for community usage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among the constituents of blood, white blood cells represent a particularly rich source of information due to their active involvement in the immune response of the body. As such, technologies that can rapidly characterize blood samples and extract reliable information are in ever-increasing demand for both clinical and basic research applications. The proposed work aims to develop smart microchips that can reliably analyze white blood cells from small blood samples without any sample preparation. These microchips will be low-cost, disposable, and will include built-in electrodes that can convert the chemical information from white blood cells into electrical signals to be interpreted by a smartphone and transmitted to the healthcare provider. The proposed research therefore has the potential to revolutionize healthcare delivery by enabling people to self-administer blood tests at home or in mobile settings. Besides his research, the PI is fully committed to the educational aspects of his profession and aspires to be a role model for next-generation engineers. The PI's educational goal is to create application-focused multidisciplinary courses, research opportunities and learning experiences for students. To this end, the PI proposes (1) to organize innovation tournaments to develop micro/nanotechnologies for solving biomedical challenges, (2) to implement a laboratory module in the graduate- and undergraduate-level courses, (3) to involve and mentor undergraduate and graduate students in conducting the research activities of this proposal, (4) to mentor high school teachers to attract K-12 and High School Students and underrepresented groups to science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) education.<br/><br/>Despite being highly effective in manipulating cells, microfluidic devices lack native sensing schemes and hence often act as upstream sample preparation elements before quantitative measurements typically performed with a laboratory instrument. The disconnect between microfluidic manipulation and quantitative measurements is an important limitation that hampers the widespread adoption of these tools outside of academic research laboratories, for example in resource-limited or in point-of-care settings, where they can be truly transformative in healthcare delivery. The PI's career goal is to develop polymer-based lab-on-a-chip (LoC) platforms with built-in sensor networks, whose purposely simple hardware will be augmented by complex computational algorithms, to function as content-aware, autonomous microfluidic devices for quantitative cell analysis. To achieve this goal, the PI will adopt a highly multidisciplinary approach combining traditionally-distant disciplines such as microsystem engineering, information theory, data science, and biomedicine. This proposal will (1) design and fabricate plastic microfluidic chips wired with networks of<br/>interconnected electrical micro-sensors, each individually designed to produce a signature response that can be recognized among others through computation, (2) develop computational algorithms to process compressed data from the sensor network by utilizing both model-based signal processing and machine learning approaches, (3) develop open- and closed-loop controlled microfluidic systems, where a host of<br/>actuators are combined with spatiotemporal data generated by networked sensors to extract biological information from the sample under test, (4) combine all of the developed concepts to create an autonomous and adaptive microfluidic system that can analyze whole blood samples by label-free immunophenotyping of white blood cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most new polymeric products contain two or more polymers and functional additives resulting in desired properties contributed from each component. The process extrudes multiple materials at the same time in a single-step process using two or more polymeric materials shaped to form a multilayer structure for unique applications. These include optical, mechanical, and gas barrier films, such as brightness-enhancing filters for electronic screens, ultra-strong safety and security window films, or elastomeric barrier films for cushioning bladders in athletic shoes. Foams can be prepared from any plastic by introducing a gas or supercritical fluid within the plastic during processing. This award supports fundamental research that will provide needed knowledge about a new coextrusion foam manufacturing technology for fabricating lightweight composites. This process will also significantly reduce production costs by decreasing material usage as well as increasing performance-to-weight ratios through proper engineering of the material microstructure. This interdisciplinary research encompasses manufacturing, polymer chemistry, polymer physics and materials science. Companies manufacturing value-added plastic materials will benefit from the results.  Students from underrepresented groups will participate in the research and a new program will be developed with a local museum to inspire interest in polymer materials for K-12 students. <br/><br/>The gas/supercritical fluid concentration-dependent crystal nucleation/growth, crystal lamellae orientation, and subsequent bubble nucleation/growth behaviors under geometric constraints pose fundamental challenges in the coextrusion foam process. Further, the materials and process parameters largely influence the microstructure and bubble morphologies. These complex, coupled phenomena affect the properties of the final composite. The objective of this research is to close the knowledge gap in the understanding of microstructural evolution and bubble nucleation/growth mechanisms in coextrusion foam processes. The research team will develop a physics-based model to understand and predict the effects of the gas/supercritical fluid concentration and the interphase compatibility on the microstructure evolution of semi-crystalline polymers and will conduct experiments to verify the model. The team will also perform atomistic and macroscopic modeling simulations to understand the bubble nucleation and growth behaviors, and will test the hypothesis that various stress states influence the solubility and diffusivity by using a newly developed dielectric method. Based on these research results, the process parameters will be selected to achieve satisfactory microstructure and foam morphologies without time-consuming trial-and-error procedures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Healthier fish stocks and habitat are in turn good news for people who depend on the sea, especially in lower-income coastal regions where people increasingly rely on fish for food. One way to structure local involvement in decision-making is community-based management (CBM), in which resource-dependent communities take active part in making and enforcing rules (for example, how, where, and when community members are allowed to fish). CBM has been offered as a way to improve developing-world fish stocks and food security for vulnerable global populations, and has been embraced globally by funders, non-governmental organizations, governments and communities. In particular, international non-governmental conservation organizations (INGOs) actively work to encourage communities around the world to adopt CBM. Understanding how INGOs affect communities' decisions to undertake CBM is thus relevant to national governments seeking to improve food security, INGOs seeking to balance human needs with ecosystem needs, network organizations seeking to empower sustainable local communities, and local communities seeking to maintain local livelihoods and culture. However, how INGOs ultimately influence the ""why"" and ""how"" of communities' decisions to engage in CBM remains poorly understood. <br/><br/>This project proposes to investigate causal links between the activities of INGOs and community-level adoption and implementation of CBM through a process tracing approach. Data will be collected through fieldwork in Fiji, a nation where INGO involvement in CBM is common. Interviews will be conducted with local leaders in purposively selected Native Fijian case study communities that are matched on community size and reliance on marine resources, but that vary on INGO involvement, adoption of CBM, and implementation of CBM. In order to triangulate findings, data collection will also include formal CBM adoption and implementation documentation, as well as interviews with representatives of INGOs active in the case study communities. Process tracing analysis will be used to identify INGO activities and influence on a) material and normative incentives for local adoption and implementation of CBM, and b) local decision-making structures. Process tracing analysis will also test whether local decision-maker attitudes mediate INGO influence on CBM uptake. Counterfactual cases will allow for exploration of alternate pathways to local adoption and/or implementation of CBM. Generalizability of initial case findings will be examined through a broader survey of INGOs active in CBM in other regions of the world.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research supported by this award will investigate if and how these experiences actually affect people's lives going forward.  Anthropologists have studied how cultural beliefs and practices produce spiritual experiences but less is known about the long-term effects of the experiences that informants describe. Do these experiences matter, and if so, how? Answering this question is important for understanding how and why people make major changes in their lives.  These changes could include mundane choices of school or career, or weighty choices such as whether to stop using drugs or join a terrorist organization.  Understanding the full range of factors involved in personal change is critical for developing interventions, counseling programs, and policies that will help Americans to live healthy, safe, and productive lives.  <br/><br/>University of Virginia anthropologist, Dr. China Scherz, and her team will investigate this question by studying the effects of spiritual experience in the lives of people attempting to make a major life change. Building on two years of preliminary research, they have chosen to focus the final phase of their study on recovery from alcohol addiction. The research will be conducted in Uganda because spiritual experiences are more commonly foregrounded in Ugandan recovery narratives due to the limited options for biomedically based addiction treatment.  Over the course of a year, the researchers will will gather data with qualitative ethnographic observations, semi-structured interviews, and mapping exercises. They  will follow 25-30 people who have tried to stop drinking, focusing on the effects of spiritual experiences in their lives over time.   Results of this research provide a model for including spiritual experiences in social scientific understandings of life transformation, which will be generalizable to many United States populations. The study will also provide the first extended analysis of contemporary modes of conceptualizing and addressing problem-drinking in an African context.  Poverty, access to schooling, and diseases including HIV, tuberculosis, cancer, and other non-communicable diseases in many sub-Saharan African countries have been increasingly linked to high levels of alcohol consumption.  Addressing these problems is important to U. S.  interests in global health and development. This study will highlight novel and cost-effective ways to capitalize on local paradigms for addressing problems related to substance abuse and mental health.   Dr. Scherz's ties with academics and policy-makers at leading national psychiatric and medical facilities in Uganda and in the United States will facilitate the dissemination of results and the translation of the study's findings into meaningful program and policy recommendations.

While the ability to forecast the track of tropical cyclones has improved, gaps remain in the knowledge and understanding of their formation or genesis, which is reflected in poorer forecasts.  Recent results suggest that the African easterly waves pathway to genesis in the Atlantic Basin is influenced by the passage of eastward-moving convectively coupled Kelvin Waves.  However, a quantitative assessment of the processes and predictability of these interactions is lacking.  This collaborative research project between the University of Miami and the University at Albany seeks to provide such a quantitative assessment and to seek a more definite answer to an outstanding question in the tropical storm research: ""why do some African easterly waves develop into Tropical Cyclone (TC) and others do not?"".  The project is divided into three phases.  The first phase will use three decades of observational and reanalysis data to test hypotheses on the physical mechanisms related to the attribution of genesis or lack of genesis to convectively coupled Kelvin Waves, on time scales of 1-3 days.  The second phase will use two decades of archived ensemble forecast data to investigate and quantify the predictability in the context of these physical mechanisms.  The third phase will extend these ideas out to 1-2 weeks, accounting for the roles of the Madden-Julian Oscillation and El Niño and the Southern Oscillation.  One novel aspect of the project is the awareness of the need to take account of convectively coupled Kelvin Wave amplitude and favorability of African Easterly Wave structures for genesis.  A second novel development is to use ensemble forecasts to push the boundaries of predictability, in identifying the extent to which the complex interactions are predictable out to 1-2 weeks, and connecting the predictability ideas to the governing physical mechanisms and large-scale flow regimes.<br/><br/>The research will provide quantitative information to support tropical forecasters.  The research will also bridge the gap between the weather and subseasonal prediction communities by advancing our understanding of science and predictability beyond traditional weather time scales, which is recognized nationally and globally as a priority.  This will lead to the identification of regimes where predictive skill of genesis and tropical cyclone activity is high or low, thereby providing information to forecasters and ultimately the decision makers who take actions based on a potential tropical cyclone threat.  A by-product of the research will be the feedback provided to operational modeling centers on strengths and weaknesses of their ensemble forecasts.  Diagnostic tools developed in this research will be shared with the research community.  The project will also advance Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics education by funding two students to pursue doctoral research, and in advancing new undergraduate and graduate courses on tropical meteorology.  An annual exchange between Miami and Albany will enable the students to visit meteorological centers and facilities in their reciprocal cities.  Undergraduate Honors thesis projects will be developed.  Several outreach activities related to tropical cyclones, aimed at increasing scientific literacy among decision-makers, the media and public will be continued as part of this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Governance systems are composed of networks of public, private, and international organizations that make collaborative decisions to solve public issues. Increasing the effectiveness of governance systems is critical for improving human security and prosperity across the world, especially in developing country settings. Large-scale natural disasters often create windows of opportunity for improving the effectiveness of governance systems by reforming the rules and norms that guide decisions, interactions and operations of networked organizations. Collaborative post-disaster reconstruction operations provide opportunities for augmenting the effectiveness of governance systems by improving resource capacity, informational infrastructure, and social support base of interorganizational networks. While much work has been done on expanding resource capacity of governance systems, especially in the context of post-conflict reconstruction and state building, little research has examined the sociotechnical foundations of governance effectiveness: how information and trust facilitate social learning and adaptive capacity, especially at the nexus of post-disaster reconstruction and governance reforms. <br/><br/>Specifically, this dissertation research traces Nepal's new constitution of September 20, 2015 and the resulting transition from a unitary governance system to a federal system of seven autonomous provinces back to the April/May 2015 earthquakes and the post-earthquake reconstruction efforts. The objective of such process-tracing is to reveal the mechanisms of change that logically connect the earthquakes and post-earthquake reconstruction operations with the changes in Nepal's governance system. Setting up a pre-post research design with a focus on short and medium-term effects, the research uses several sources of secondary as well as original expert interview data to measure changes in resource capacity, informational infrastructure, and the social support base. Resource capacity measures are constructed using government statistical reports, foreign aid donor reports, the Prime Ministers Disaster Relief Fund data and the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs financial tracking data. The informational capacity of the system is measured using knowledge graph datasets of the ""Global Data on Events, Location and Tone"" database that records organizations and their dyadic interactions in the context of Nepal's governance system and post-disaster reconstruction. Changes in the social support base are measured using news articles, opinion surveys of news organizations and think tanks as well as multiple waves of post-earthquake citizen feedback surveys conducted by civil society organizations and international development organizations. Semi-structured expert interview data and field observations from Nepal cross-validates the findings of the study and uncovers nuances to the specified mechanisms of change. The resulting analyses show how the 2015 earthquakes and post-earthquake rebuilding projects have significantly shaped the governance system of Nepal. This case study contributes to the broader literature in collaborative disaster governance, humanitarian assistance, and post-disaster governance reforms in developing countries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the specific causes of the declines are unknown it is suspected that they are related to changing ice and water temperature as lakes have experienced reduced ice cover and significant thermal warming in response to environmental change. What is needed is a globally coordinated experiment to test the causes for these declines. Funds are provided to support US participants in a two-day international workshop to design and coordinate a cross-latitudinal, cross-continental experiment to evaluate the ability of freshwater whitefishes (subfamily Coregoninae) to adapt to changing temperature and habitat changes across global latitudes. Workshop participants will design a large-scale common experiment to identify the causes and consequences of global scale changes in lake temperature and ice cover.<br/><br/>This workshop will provide a unique opportunity to design and implement an international collaborative global scale experiment to assess the role of changing global thermal regimes on the role of adaptation and plasticity to changes in life history, physiology, and phenotype through genetic and epigenetic changes of a key freshwater fish family.

The workshop offers an excellent opportunity to integrate and encourage ecological and molecular approaches to enhance and strengthen understanding of environmental change impacts on global fish populations.  Besides the direct fisheries management impacts of the research, it will serve as a significant training experience in team science for the participating graduate students and early career faculty.

They also represent a control on carbon capture and storage, high-level radioactive waste storage, groundwater sources and storage and shale hydrocarbon extraction. Fine-grained soils play an equally important role in agriculture and soil carbon storage. This importance of clay-rich media derives largely from their distinct hydrologic and mechanical properties (ultra-low permeability, swelling-shrinking and cracking). These properties are of singular importance in controlling fluid flow in the subsurface (where fine-grained rocks constitute roughly two-thirds of the sedimentary rock mass), yet they remain a sparsely charted frontier research area in groundwater hydrology.<br/> <br/><br/>This project will develop a general theory of the hydrologic properties of fine-grained soils and sedimentary rocks. This goal requires understanding the coupled hydrologic, mechanical, and chemical properties of porous media on multiple scales, from the nanometer scale (where aggregation and swelling of clay particles takes place) to the 10-100s of meters that control the bulk mechanical and flow properties of the rock. The proposed research relies on a combination of simulation methodologies adapted to each length scale of interest, along with rigorous experimental validations at each scale. Key projected outcomes include detailed fundamental understanding of the meso- and nanoscale properties of fine-grained media and new constitutive relations describing the coupled hydrologic-mechanical-chemical properties of these media. The major education and outreach goal is to develop the use of molecular dynamics simulations as a pedagogical tool that can illustrate the fundamental basis of important scientific concepts and phenomena in an intuitive, and hands-on manner. This tool will be developed for both first year of the Environmental Engineering undergraduate curriculum and as part of a web-based interface (a Science Gateway) that will enable the broader community (e.g., high school students and teachers) to visualize and explore simulation results stored on the high-performance data storage systems at the National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award provides resources for a workshop that brings together theorists and experimentalists to discuss a possible new kind of superconductivity that may have application in the development of quantum computers. The workshop will be held at Rice University on April 24-25, 2018. Whether a material conducts electricity or not provides a natural classification of materials into metals like copper and insulators like silicon. Within the past 20 years, it was realized that insulators can be bit more interesting. There are the classic insulators like silicon and rubber, but there are also topological insulators which have an insulating bulk and intrinsic metallic states that surround the surfaces and edges. Bismuth selenide, a compound made from the elements of bismuth and selenium, provides an example of a topological insulator. Since the discovery of topological insulators, new classes of topological materials have been proposed, among these are topological superconductors. Superconductors have no resistance to the flow of electricity. This reflects the collective quantum mechanical behavior of the electrons in the superconducting state. Topological superconductors have a superconducting bulk. While topological insulators have associated metallic surface states, topological superconductors have exotic surface states that behave differently than collections of ordinary particles like electrons and photons - the ""particles"" of light, but in a way that could form the basis of computation by manipulation of a quantum mechanical state. Topological materials are robust to noise and defects that would disrupt most quantum mechanical states and severely limit their use in quantum computers.<br/>Driven by potential applications to quantum computing, there is now an intense worldwide search for materials that exhibit the experimental signatures of topological superconductors. This two-day workshop will bring together scientists from around the world that use experiments to probe candidate materials, as well as those that develop the theory and phenomenology of topological superconductivity.  An important distinguishing feature of this workshop will be a focus on bulk topological superconducting materials and two-dimensional surface states. The workshop will address an acute need to gather and focus theoretical and experimental leaders in this nascent field, which has received much less attention than other efforts to engineer quantum computers. Graduate and undergraduate students will be encouraged to attend the workshop to excite interest in the next generation. A report on opportunities in research on topological superconductivity will result from this activity.

Spurred by the need to reduce emissions, the electric generation mix is drifting away from traditional fuel-based sources, towards new renewable sources with very different characteristics. However, integrating renewable sources into the existing grid in an efficient and reliable manner will not be possible unless one devises appropriate mechanisms to overcome the technical challenges associated with high levels of renewable penetration. The main challenges that hinder high levels of renewable penetration include (a) the increased dynamic degradation induced by renewable sources, (b) the uncertainty and intermittency in energy production levels, and (c) the incentives misalignment that preclude renewable energy sources to behave in a more grid-friendly manner. <br/><br/>To address these challenges this CAREER proposal aims to develop a new generation of decentralized controllers, distributed algorithms, and market designs that can unlock today's grid rigidity, capture the value of fast timescale actions in operational costs, and allow a seamless integration of renewables. This is achieved by focusing on two main goals. The first goal aims to develop analysis and design tools that allow the systematic design of (i) decentralized algorithms with robustness guarantees, (ii) dynamics-aware distributed optimization algorithms that can perform real-time optimization without introducing system-wide instabilities, and (iii) multi-timescale markets that integrate operations and controls. The second goal is to leverage the developed tools in the design of new control features that are aimed at boosting the grid flexibility.

In recent years, a class of low-cost chemical materials, known as transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs), have been identified as promising materials for water-based hydrogen production to power fuel cells and as a raw material for the manufacture of chemicals.  Despite their promise, additional scientific understanding and engineering design will be needed to maximize the performance of the dichalcogenide materials to levels rivaling more expensive state-of-the-art platinum-based catalysts. To that end, the project will explore fundamental aspects of the dichalcogenide materials and their effectiveness for hydrogen generation utilizing a unique reactor system. The research will help pave the path to a sustainable energy and chemicals future while also laying ground work for long-term competitiveness of the U.S. in the fuels and chemical manufacturing sectors.  The research will be integrated with educational and outreach activities emphasizing participation by under-represented groups. <br/> <br/>The project seeks answers to the extent that electronic transport properties and interfacial effects (rather than the free energy of hydrogen adsorption) limit the overall rate of the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) on TMDCs.  A single-crystalline flake nanodevice will be employed as a HER micro-reactor, which allows precise control of the density and types of catalytic sites, and accurate measurements of charge transport within the catalyst, as well as the Schottky barrier at the catalyst/current collector interface. Three aims are proposed to study how the TMDC electrical properties, interfacial Schottky barrier, and the hydrogen adsorption free energy change as a function of 1) the phase transition from the semiconducting 2H to the semi-metallic 1T' phase of TMDCs, 2) strain engineering of TMDCs, and 3) different current collectors. The changes in the various properties will be correlated with the measured HER activities using a standard three-electrode cell coupled to the individual TMDC nanodevices in sulfuric acid electrolyte solution. Semiconducting MoS2 and WS2, and semi-metallic MoTe2 and WTe2 nanoflakes will be used for the proposed research, grown by chemical vapor deposition or exfoliated mechanically from bulk crystals grown by chemical vapor transport.  Beyond optimization of TMDC materials for HER, the nanodevice platform can be applied to other electro- and photo-catalysts to correlate their catalytic properties to critical parameters such as energetics of catalytic sites, equilibrium electrical properties, interfacial effects, and excited states induced by photons. The project will link the research to education and outreach activities via three outreach programs targeting, respectively, the general public (a weekend Energy symposium at Yale West Campus), under-represented undergraduate students (a monthly seminar series given by minority faculty members), and local high school students (a demonstration HER kit and workbook based on TMDC thin films).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of this DOM is highly resistant to degradation (refractory) and aged, but the nature and reasons behind the accumulation of refractory DOM in the ocean is one of the unresolved mysteries of the marine carbon cycle. While marine sediments have been shown to be a globally important source of DOM to the ocean, the connection between sediment DOM dynamics and the oceanic DOM cycle remains elusive, because information is lacking on the molecular composition and reactivity of pore water DOM.  To fill this knowledge gap, this project will address the question of how refractory DOM is produced in sediments and the fate of benthic DOM in the water column.  The research will focus on the relationship between protein/peptide dynamics and sediment DOM cycling, examining peptide deamination as an important pathway for the production of refractory and 14C-depleted DOM in continental margin sediments. These objectives will be met through a combination of geochemical profiling of sediment cores collected across a range of redox conditions, and long-term sediment incubation studies conducted under controlled laboratory conditions. At the heart of this proposed work is structural elucidation and quantification of intact and deaminated peptides in pore-water DOM using state-of-the-art analytical techniques.  The study will help better understand how the present-day carbon cycle operates, as well as how it may respond in the future. The proposed work will integrate research and education using several approaches. All PIs routinely integrate their research into their classes, which range from introductory-undergraduate to advanced-graduate courses and will continue to do so here.  All three PIs are also committed to engaging women and underrepresented minority students. <br/><br/>Marine sediments are a globally important source of dissolved organic matter (DOM) to the ocean.  However, the connection between sediment DOM dynamics and the oceanic DOM cycle remains elusive because information about the molecular composition and reactivity of pore water DOM is lacking.  To help fill this knowledge gap, this project will address the question of how refractory DOM is produced in sediments and the fate of the benthic DOM flux in the water column.   The proposed study explores a novel and potentially transformative idea that deamination of peptides in sediments is a source of refractory and 14C-depleted DOM in seawater. This idea is consistent not only with the fact that the majority of seawater dissolved organic nitrogen occurs in amide form, but also with recent reports about the widespread occurrence of nitrogen-bearing formulas in deep-sea refractory DOM. The central hypothesis will be tested through a unique blend of bottom-up (molecular level DOM analyses) and top-down (bulk-level elemental and isotopic analyses, and numerical modeling) approaches. This work will involve a combination of geochemical profiling of sediment cores collected across a range of redox conditions, and long-term sediment incubation studies conducted under controlled laboratory conditions.  At the heart of the proposed work is structural elucidation and quantification of intact and deaminated peptides in pore-water DOM using a state-of-the-art liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry system (ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled to an Orbitrap Fusion Tribrid Mass Spectrometer), which is expected to provide an unprecedented wealth of molecular-level information about pore water DOM. The proposed work will lead to an improved mechanistic understanding of organic matter decomposition and benthic DOM cycling and shed light on the connections between the modern-day oceanic and sedimentary carbon and nitrogen cycles as they relate to the formation of refractory DOM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The REU site fits within an initiative in the College of Engineering at TAMUK to involve undergraduate students in research and boost the participation of US citizens (especially Hispanic and female students) in graduate research. The REU site builds on a vision of grooming aspiring researchers from underrepresented groups to embrace the challenge of energy research and developing future leaders who proactively contribute to the nation's energy self-reliance agenda.<br/><br/>This REU Site is designed to develop and implement a model environment for multidisciplinary collaborative efforts where research and education are tightly integrated around the different facets of sustainable energy and environment research. Ten students from various engineering and science departments will be recruited through a nationwide search with special emphasis on Hispanic and female students. It features a 10-week interdisciplinary team approach to mentoring students on different research projects. The proposed sustainable energy research consists of three major research areas: 1) Energy Harvesting, 2) Energy Utilization, and 3) Energy Policy, Environmental and Social Impacts. The specific objectives are: 1) providing research opportunities in the different aspects of energy research to undergraduate students, especially Hispanic and women; 2) increasing the number of underrepresented students who participate in graduate education; and 3) building collaborative links among faculty and students from different engineering departments at TAMUK. Through participation in cutting-edge research with faculty mentors working at the forefront of their respective disciplines, students will engage in complex scientific studies on sustainable energy and environment research topics. The program is structured to teach students how to formulate research questions and develop/modify research plans with the guidance of their research mentors. In addition to the hands-on collaborative research experience, technical and social activities will be incorporated into the program to provide students with a solid foundation in analytical, writing, and presentation skills, helping to enhance the interaction between REU students and faculty mentors. The students will also gain experience with reporting and discussing their research results in multiple settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One well-known feature of existing data is that people shift from risk seeking in some situations (e.g., buying a lottery ticket), to risk aversion in others (e.g., purchasing insurance). To explain this basic instability of risk taking, economists have recently proposed new theories in which attention directly shapes risk-taking. However, empirical work that tests these new attention-based theories has lagged substantially due to constraints on data availability. In this CAREER proposal, this problem is addressed by collecting direct measures of attention in experiments using eye-tracking and neural data to inform the mathematical modeling of behavior and decision processes. The work will also use proprietary data from the field to test the generalizability of the main findings from the controlled laboratory experiments. Ultimately, the goal of this work is to integrate research on attention into standard economic analyses, which will dramatically increase explanatory power of current economic models and inform public policy. The educational component of this project will target several different levels of education from middle school students to PhD candidates.  The PI will create a new undergraduate course in neuroeconomics, offer summer research internships to undergraduates, and train a business school PhD student in cutting edge methods in behavioral and neuroeconomics. There will also be a significant outreach component in which the PI will work with a STEM elementary school to broaden access to basic principles of behavioral economics. <br/>The overall objective of the proposed research is to develop novel experimental tests of attention-based theories of economic choice. There are three specific research goals. First, the PI will conduct an experimental test, using eye tracking data, to characterize the attention function that maps monetary payoffs into measures of attention. Under several of the theories to be tested, there is an assumption that attention to monetary payoffs is deployed in a manner similar to how attention is allocated to sensory stimuli (e.g., a visual photo). The experiment will be designed to test these properties, which will provide much needed guidance for a rapidly growing theoretical literature. Second, the PI will experimentally test for broader sources of attention allocation to payoffs -- including visual properties of the choice set. The PI will also test for feedback loops between attention and risk preferences. Third, the PI will test whether the attention mechanism that affects risk taking in a controlled laboratory setting can be generalized to high-stakes environments in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Photocatalysts that make fuels, such as methane, using only carbon dioxide, water and sunlight would have significant benefit to society. However, developing photocatalysts capable of sunlight-to-fuel conversion is a challenging problem that requires a fundamental understanding of the chemical reactions taking place on the nanocrystal surface. With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry, Professor Sadtler at Washington University in St. Louis is developing microscopy methods to watch individual, light-driven reactions as they occur on single nanocrystal photocatalysts. Together, Professor Sadtler and his students are gaining new insights into why some atomic sites on the surface of nanocrystals are particularly active for catalysis. Professor Sadtler is also infusing his research into education. He is developing new courses that use atomic structure and chemical bonding as a basis to teach the frontiers of chemistry and materials science, as well as working with high school teachers and students in the St. Louis area.<br/><br/>Metal oxide semiconductor nanocrystals with tunable stoichiometry are promising photocatalysts to produce liquid fuels through solar water splitting, partial methane oxidation, and the reduction of carbon dioxide. However, the contribution of specific structural and morphological features among individual catalyst particles to their ensemble activity is not well understood because each particle is different and possesses a variety of potential reaction sites. This project uses super-resolution fluorescence microscopy and redox-active fluorogenic probes to monitor photoinduced charge-transfer events on individual metal oxide nanocrystals with nanoscale spatial resolution. Correlation of the reactivity maps with the atomic resolution of scanning transmission electron microscopy performed on the same particles reveals how the distribution of oxygen vacancies in individual particles affects their reactivity. To further develop structure-activity relationships in metal oxide photocatalysts, the single-molecule, single-particle data are compared to measurements of bulk photocatalytic activity for methane oxidation and carbon dioxide reduction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Though directed care by trained physical therapists has been shown to effectively prevent such injuries, the resources available for such re-training are limited. Unfortunately, the diagnosis of those at greatest risk for such ligament tears depends upon expensive, time-consuming observations by trained clinicians using qualitative metrics that have been shown to be challenging to consistently apply. This project will develop automated prehabilitative techniques to diagnose those at increased risk for ACL injury by constructing and quantitatively analyzing an individual-specific musculoskeletal model of motion. This will ensure the reliable behavior of the diagnostic technique created in this project. Importantly, this broadly deployable approach will add a preventive component for the treatment of ACL injuries that afflict more than 200,000 people annually and drastically affect a patient's quality of life thereafter. More broadly, these models of motion will fundamentally change how human assistive devices are controlled. The ability to leverage systems-based techniques during control will enable the wide distribution of such assistive devices, which currently require careful physician and engineer-guided tuning. This project promotes the progress of science and contributes significantly to advance the national health. The integrated education plan not only has direct impact on undergraduate education but also provides great opportunities for K-12 students to explore STEM careers by exposing them to robotic control via hands-on examples.<br/><br/>This project supports the development of numerical techniques to diagnose an increased risk for ACL injury given articulated pose observations from a set of cameras of an individual performing a functional motion screen.

Second, a novel diagnostic tool that tractably evaluates injury risk metrics across all identified model parameterizations to ensure that misdiagnosis does not occur. Finally, a real-world, two yearlong longitudinal evaluation on 25 healthy subjects and 125 patients who are undergoing rehabilitation after an ACL reconstructive surgery.

Fertilization requires pollen to land on the female flower and form a pollen tube, a rapidly elongating single-celled projection which grows through the female tissue, in some cases for several centimeters. This pollen tube is able to reorient its growth in response to chemical guidance cues to deliver the male reproductive cells to the female. The pollen tube, like other plant cells is surrounded by a cell wall and cell expansion requires the proper secretion of new cell wall material that is specifically targeted to the specialized, flexible cell wall at the growing tip. The internal secretory machinery and the cell wall must be appropriately coordinated with each other and with the direction of elongation for successful sustained growth. Despite the importance of this process for agricultural production, a major gap exists in our understanding of how the external cell wall and the intracellular secretory apparatus coordinate to maintain a stable but responsive tip region over time. This project will elucidate the linkage between these two compartments using genetics, biochemistry and cell imaging approaches. The research will also support the training of graduate and undergraduate students. Research activities will be integrated into an introductory plant biology lab course giving students an authentic research experience. In addition, the project will provide interactive, hands-on activities to the general public in collaboration with the University of Michigan Museum of Natural History. This project was co-funded by the Plant, Fungal and Microbial Developmental Mechanisms Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Cellular Dynamics and Function Program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences. <br/><br/>Flowering plant fertility depends on the sustained rapid elongation of pollen tubes and their ability to reorient growth to effectively target receptive ovules. Proper pollen tube elongation requires hydroxyproline (hyp) O-arabinosylation, the posttranslational addition of arabinose sugar chains to hydroxyprolines. Arabinosyltransferase mutants exhibit shorter, wider and sometimes branched pollen tubes, suggesting impaired tip-region stability. The secretion required for pollen tube elongation depends on the highly dynamic F-actin structures at the pollen tube tip. F-actin organization is controlled, in part, by the nucleation activity of class 1 formin homology proteins. The extracellular domains of these proteins contain predicted arabinosylation motifs which have been implicated in interaction with the cell wall. This project will test the hypothesis that the pollen tube cell wall and actin cytoskeleton are coordinated via hyp O-arabinosylation of the class 1 formin homology proteins, limiting their actin organizing activity to appropriate cortical domains though interaction with the overlying cell wall.  Altered cell wall polarity and actin organization will be assayed in the mutants and wild type. The in vivo glycosylation status of the class 1 formins will be determined for three important members of this protein family, including two known regulators of pollen tube actin. Furthermore, the effect of the extracellular domains on protein mobility and localization in the pollen tube will be determined. This research will establish an essential point of connection between two major cell components required for pollen tube polarization and growth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia. The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign grants is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on ""OTREC"".<br/><br/>Tropical convection plays a critical role in earth's climate system and is also responsible for extreme precipitation and hurricane formation. Easterly waves are of particular interest for weather forecasting given their tendency to spawn hurricanes. More generally, tropical convection is an engine of weather and climate worldwide yet poorly understood and difficult to simulate. Work leading to better representation of tropical convection in weather and climate models can thus lead to better weather forecasts and impact assessments, both for the public and decision makers. Aside from the societal relevance of the science, the campaign includes several education and outreach activities including support for undergraduates to participate in fieldwork and production of short documentary videos for use in classroom teaching and informal science education. In addition, the Principal Investigators (PIs) of this grant incorporate results from the campaign into their outreach to New Mexico high schools, in part through a class on weather and climate offered in the Masters of Science Teaching program at New Mexico Tech. They also develop materials for K-12 classroom teaching in their state. The project supports a graduate student and a postdoctoral research fellow, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.<br/><br/>The eight-week OTREC deployment consists primarily of a set of 20 flights of the Gulfstream V (GV) research aircraft maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). The campaign uses an airport in Costa Rica for easy access to the equatorial Pacific and southwest Caribbean study regions, and conditions in these regions are sampled using dropsondes and a wing-mounted W-band radar. Dropsondes contain the same instrument package as standard weather balloons, only dropped from an aircraft (in this case from about 40,000 feet) with a small parachute.<br/><br/>Despite intensive study we lack a satisfactory theory for how environmental conditions determine when and where tropical convection will form, how long it will last, how much it will expand and organize, and how much rain it will produce. The PIs have developed a theory in which deep convection over warm oceans is controlled by three thermodynamic factors: heat and moisture coming from the underlying ocean, the ""saturation fraction"" of the atmospheric column (a kind of bulk relative humidity), and moist convective instability (with a counterintuitive association between weaker instability and heavier rainfall). But the theory assumes uniform atmospheric and oceanic conditions, and this assumption may not hold in the eastern equatorial Pacific. Instead, the region features a large north-south contrast in sea surface temperature (SST) accompanied by a narrow east-west convection band called the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ). The sharp SST contrast provides an alternative explanation for ITCZ convection, as near-surface winds generally blow across the temperature contrast and converge over the warmer SSTs. Rising motion where low-level winds converge can produce convection, but the observed convection does not clearly match expectations based on SST contrast arguments.<br/><br/>A further issue involves the vertical structure of convective clouds, as convective clouds in the eastern Pacific ITCZ are relatively shallow yet they produce rain rates similar to their deeper counterparts over the western Pacific. The PIs have an explanation for the development of heavy rain from mid-depth convection which can be tested using campaign data. A further mystery is that satellite data from the NASA Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) seem to show a large amount of stratiform rain in the eastern Pacific, even though high stratiform rain fraction is usually associated with the anvil cloud and decaying cloud plumes found in regions of deep convection. The PIs argue that cloud features identified as stratiform rain in TRMM data should instead be classified as weak cellular convection, thus removing the inconsistency between stratiform rain amounts and relatively shallow convection. The combination of dropsonde and airborne radar data should suffice to distinguish between stratiform rain clouds and weak cellular convection.<br/><br/>In contrast, SSTs in the southwest Caribbean are quite uniform so convection does not develop from SST-induced wind convergence. Moreover, mid-tropospheric air over the area is relatively dry and thus not conducive to convection and heavy rainfall.  Yet convection and heavy rainfall still occur, often associated with the passage of easterly waves. These waves appear on a weekly basis and sometimes cross Central America to reach the eastern Pacific.  But it is not clear whether the majority of easterly waves in the eastern Pacific come from the Caribbean or if they form locally.  These issues are also addressed in the campaign.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite claims of economic and environmental benefits, reuse economies are significantly understudied, and empirical research is scarce.

For example, wheelchair-mounted assistive robot arms can help people with motor impairments perform activities of daily living (like eating) independently, increasing their self-sufficiency and quality of life. However, robot assistance is limited by the fact that robots cannot always recognize when people want or need help. The goal of this research is to develop algorithms that enable robots to recognize when a person is having difficulty with a physical task, based on their behavior before they reach a failure point, and then provide the necessary assistance to complete the task. This work will draw from psychology to explore how nonverbal behaviors like eye gaze, body posture, and facial expression can reveal people's need for assistance. The project will include a data collection study of nonverbal behavior during robot operation. The nonverbal behavior collected during this study will be open sourced to enable other researchers to draw insights about human behavior during human-robot interactions. The work will improve the usefulness of collaborative and assistive robots and lead to better integration of personal robots in workplaces, homes, and assistive care environments.<br/><br/>The main research question in this work is: can robots recognize that a person needs assistance based on their nonverbal behaviors during a human-robot interaction? To investigate this, the project has four goals. Goal 1: Recognize the need for assistance. The work will begin with a large-scale data collection of people's nonverbal behavior (eye gaze, body posture, and facial expressions) during an assistive human-robot manipulation task. Using machine learning approaches, the project team will train predictors on the data that can use nonverbal behavior patterns to recognize when people need assistance. Goal 2: Provide assistance. By monitoring real-time nonverbal behaviors during a human-robot interaction, this system will use the trained predictors from Goal 1 to identify when a person needs help. Once the system predicts that assistance is required, it should be able to provide that assistance seamlessly and in real time using shared autonomy. Goal 3: Evaluate the system. Individual system components will be validated separately, then a full-scale evaluation will be conducted to measure the utility of the implemented system in a real-world assistive human-robot interaction.

Despite the potential consequences, no consensus currently exists regarding the brain and behavioral causes of DD. The project team will attempt to characterize the development of and interaction between brain mechanisms responsible for processing symbolic and nonsymbolic numbers in children from kindergarten through 2nd grade with DD, with the hope that understanding the root causes of the disorder will aid the development of effective diagnostic and remedial tools for educational interventions. They will engage in a combination of neuroscientific and behavioral research in order to disambiguate between competing causal theories that are unlikely to be distinguished on the basis of behavioral evidence alone. The project is supported by a CAREER award to Vanderbilt University by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning.<br/><br/>Competing theories of the underlying cause of DD suggest that there is a deficit either in the representation of numerical magnitude, or in the connection between those representations and symbolic numbers. The project will attempt to disambiguate between these theories by providing a multimodal characterization of the neural networks involved in basic nonsymbolic and symbolic number processing in DD children using functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), as well as structural metrics of grey and white matter. The project will examine the development of those networks and will examine the extent to which those networks predict typical and atypical mathematical skill development. Investigators will study children with DD, children with dyslexia (DL), and typically developing (TD) children longitudinally from kindergarten to 2nd grade. By contrasting between these three groups, the investigators will be able to identify atypical brain and behavioral phenotypes that are specific to DD, as well as identify any commonalities between DD and DL. In each year, participants will complete a battery of symbolic and nonsymbolic number processing tasks in the fMRI scanner, in addition to a battery of behavioral tests measuring mathematics skills and general cognitive abilities. Measures of brain structure will also be collected in each year, allowing investigators to assess functional brain activation, functional and structural connectivity, and their relation to behavior and to each other. At the conclusion of the research project, the research team will provide evidence supporting a characterization of the core neurofunctional abnormalities in basic number processing underlying DD, identify the relationships between structural brain integrity and functional neural mechanisms underlying numerical magnitude processing in DD, and explore the causal developmental relationships beween aberrant number processing brain mechanisms and math outcomes in DD from kindergarten through 2nd grade.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The instrument will support faculty and student research at Columbia University, the American Museum of Natural History, other universities in the region and high school teachers and students. Water and CO2 analysis is an increasingly important tool in research on volatile element effects on mantle processes, volcanic activity and the environment. Detailed understanding of the distribution and chemical behavior of water and carbon dioxide in a range of rock types and conditions will be enabled by the acquisition. Students will be trained in instrumental procedures and the instrument will serve regional institutions in the Mid-Atlantic states and New England. The acquisition will also support faculty outreach efforts to engage regional K-12 and community college students in societally relevant environmental and geohazards research. This support is congruent with NSF's mission of promoting the progress of science and advancing the national health, prosperity and welfare and training the next generation scientific workforce. <br/><br/>The past years have seen a leap in understanding of the incorporation and diffusion of water in silicate minerals. Recent laboratory experiments have revealed infrared (IR) band-specific diffusivities in both clinopyroxene and olivine, meaning that the rate of water loss from a crystal depends on the specific defect that hosts H. Different defects can lose water at rates that vary over orders of magnitude. IR imaging becomes necessary to illuminate the zonation profiles for specific defects. Recent work finds pervasive H zonation profiles in volcanic crystals with rapid mapping, and potentially each crystal can tell its specific ascent history. Magma ascent rate is a parameter otherwise difficult to constrain, but one that may be critical to the vigor of eruption. Water zonation in minerals found in mantle xenoliths also records the timing of magma ascent and xenolith re-equilibration, essential for understanding the water content, and thus strength, of mantle lithosphere. IR imaging of water zonation in crystals and melts, at higher resolution and for greater populations of samples, has the capability to provide a new understanding of not only the volatile history of tectonic plates, but also the volatile budget, migration rate and explosive potential of magmas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigators will analyze how a public investment like rail transit affects land values, residential location decisions, and neighborhood changes in ways that influence metropolitan-wide patterns of segregation, with special emphasis given to the movements of lower-income residents.  The project will enhance basic understanding of fundamental theories regarding residential sorting.  It will help fill an important gap in the current state of knowledge of gentrification processes by modeling where potentially displaced residents move.  The project will help identify motivating factors that influence decisions to stay or leave a neighborhood impacted by new transit development through community-engaged scholarship that focuses on the perspectives of local residents and that connects residents, researchers, and key stakeholders and decision makers.  Given widespread investments in rail transit, project results will provide information and perspectives that can be used to address social and public policy issues in many communitiesacross the United States and elsewhere.  The project also will promote technical literacy and education by engaging students and community partners in an applied, mixed-methods geography course where they will examine the issue, participate in surveying residents, perform basic analyses on the collected data, and map and measure segregation trends following the implementation of a new rail transit line.<br/><br/>Much of the recent scholarship examining relationships among rail transit investments, displacement, and gentrification has emphasized how land values and aggregate-level neighborhood outcomes are impacted by transit.  This research project will focus on the movement of lower-income residents in response to transit investments by addressing the following research questions:  (1) Are lower-income residents more likely to move out of neighborhoods following the placement of new transit stations than other residents?  (2) Do lower-income residents relocate to neighborhoods with lower socioeconomic composition?  (3) What are the motivating factors that affect relocation decisions both into and out of transit neighborhoods?  (4) Where and for which income groups do residential economic segregation trends change following the establishment of a new transit system?  To gather quantitative data about residential movements and to understand the rationale behind these locational decisions, the investigators will employ a mix of multi-scalar methods.  They will analyze an individual-level, longitudinal dataset collected as part of the Panel Study on Income Dynamics to trace residential movements of individuals in and out of transit neighborhoods throughout the United States since 1970.  They also will conduct a complementary qualitative analysis in neighborhoods along a new transit line in Charlotte, North Carolina, that will involve interviews with key individuals at both the city and community scales as well as surveys and focus groups with neighborhood residents in proximity to stations of the new line.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Disasters magnify the challenges of managing within this environment, especially when the institution is constrained in its ability to accommodate the unique needs of students who are facing significant difficulties after a natural disaster. The short term disruption caused by a disaster can lead to long-term consequences for public institutions, but many of these more pronounced consequences may not be fully attributable to the effects of the disaster, but instead may be a function of the inability of policy frameworks and administrative structures to adapt to the needs of public institutions and policy beneficiaries after extreme events. Especially important are the financial consequences of enrollment loss and the constraints that come with accreditation structures. This study will use administrative interviews and data on student success to examine the role of policy design in post-disaster decisions and its influence on student success. We hope that our findings will motivate discussions among federal education officials and accreditation organization leaders about the ways in which they may consider options that would enable institutions to better support students in their efforts to rebuild their lives and pursue their educational goals.<br/><br/><br/>Theories of publicness, political control, policy implementation, and the politics of attention mostly speak to the challenges faced by public sector leaders in times of relative stability (not in response to extreme events), and many discussions of disaster response are limited to elected officials and/or federal agencies.

We will use a mixed methods design, with qualitative interviews of administrators and a quantitative analysis of student data. The study site is Lamar University in Beaumont, TX.

To avoid saturating available storage capacity, such data must be compressed at a high ratio. Biological sequences are created over the course of evolution by mutation processes, including substitution, insertion, deletion, and duplication. While these processes shape the statistical properties of genomic sequences and play a critical role in determining which compression approaches will provide improved performance, they are not taken into account by current methods. The goal of this project is to provide a principled approach to biological data compression by developing and leveraging mutation models that approximate the generation process of genomic sequences.<br/><br/>The main research thrusts of the project are: 1) determining the fundamental limits of the compressibility of biological sequences; and 2) developing and evaluating encoding and decoding algorithms that approach these limits. Identifying the limits of compression relies on developing combinatorial and stochastic string-editing models that represent sequence generation through genomic mutations. These models are then studied from an information-theoretic point of view to determine their combinatorial and stochastic capacities, thus providing bounds on the compressibility of genomic sequences. The second thrust leverages the statistical properties arising from mutation models, such as repeat structures, to develop efficient compression tools. In addition to improving compression methods, the success of these research directions will enhance our understanding of complex sequence generation processes, enable the generation of faithful synthetic data, and facilitate the quantitative study of the role of mutations in generating novel biological functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It specifically investigates online news sources that propagate fabricated stories, explores how users engage with these sources on social media, and examines ways to nudge users to be more conscious consumers of online news.  This investigation aims to provide new perspectives that address digital misinformation by focusing on the following questions: How can we establish differences between mainstream sources and misleading sources of online news? How can we nudge people to be more careful and conscious consumers of online news? <br/><br/>The research will be conducted along two symbiotic lines of inquiry. The first involves empirical investigation of misleading online news sources to develop a deep understanding of their behavior along the following threads: topical and writing style differences from mainstream sources, user engagement distinctions, and the corresponding temporal changes. This inquiry will be based on the following data: a professionally curated list of online news sources along with their credibility labels from expert fact-checkers, and tweets sent out by these news sources over a period of at least a year. The second thrust of this research focuses on exploring design interventions to increase people's awareness while they read news on social media sites.  Specifically, it will investigate two classes of design nudges on Twitter. The first intervention, emphasize, will nudge users to reflect on the ambiguity and uncertainty present in certain news posts. Emphasize will automatically detect whether a social media news post from a mainstream source has been questioned and highlight those question tweets for the news reader. The second intervention, de-emphasize, will be triggered whenever news posts originate from misleading sources, to make that post less visible in an attempt to minimize exposure to misleading online news. The human-centered evaluations that accompany the deployment of these interventions will provide qualitative and quantitative evidence about user experiences, as well as measurements about the efficacy of these interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wind shear can interact with the tropical cyclone vortex through a process called ventilation to inject cool, dry environmental air into the tropical system.  While it is well known that these processes exist, there is significant uncertainty as to how ventilation occurs and how it modulates tropical cyclone development.  This project will shed light on these issues by conducting a series of high-resolution numerical modeling simulations.  The main societal impact of the project will be improved knowledge of the factors that affect hurricane intensity, which is especially important for forecasts of hurricanes near populated and vulnerable areas.  The researchers also plan outreach events for students and the general public to enhance scientific literacy.  Two early career researchers will also be educated and trained under this project, ensuring the development of a highly capable workforce.<br/><br/>The research team plans an idealized modeling study to increase understanding of how dry air and vertical wind shear work synergistically through the process of ventilation to modulate tropical cyclone development.  The CM1 model will be used with different combinations of vertical wind shear and relative humidity, starting from tropical cyclones states with different initial intensities.  The simulations will be analyzed to test the following hypotheses:  1) low- and mid-level ventilation both increase as the relative humidity decreases and the vertical wind shear increases, but the ventilation pathway depends on the intensity of the TC, 2) mid-level ventilation is accomplished by vortex Rossby waves in the inner core and descending radial inflow in the stratiform region of TC rainbands, 3) ventilation increases lateral entrainment of low-moist static energy air into convection and convective/turbulent mixing of low-moist static energy air into the boundary layer, thereby weakening TC convection and the secondary circulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Single-instance database algorithms are prone to three distinct problems. First, in the context of Big Data science, the size of the data compared to the number of variables makes it difficult to develop complex predictors without overfitting, and more traditional learning algorithms may lead to over-simplified models that do not capture important related influences or interactions between different types of healthcare information. Second, training and testing predictive models on a single database can lead to learning noise or other irrelevant local practices or differences in definitions that are correlated with, but not causally related to, the outcome in question. This leads to models that do not work in other institutions or in the future when practices or the environment changes. Third, sharing data between institutions, and in particular, across borders, is extremely problematic because of trust, legal issues, privacy issues and national policies. The significance of solving these issues is threefold: 1) it would allow the creating of strong generalizable data science models, which leverage enormous pools of data from around the world; 2) it would also allow the identification of rare diseases or patient types, which, as we compile databases, become less rare; and 3) perhaps most importantly, it would allow the free exchange of data science models and generalized approaches to solving medical problems in the cloud.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a set of distributed deep learning and cloud computation techniques for cross-institution and cross-border machine learning on health and medical data without the need for protected health information to leave the generating institution. The goals are to create demonstration programs which illustrate feasibility and open source the architecture. The scope of this project encompasses the broad set of machine learning-based tasks multiple institutions may want to apply to their healthcare data in the cloud, as well as the technical issues surrounding transfer learning of knowledge across domains (e.g., institutions/demographics) and tasks (e.g., types of classification and prediction problems). The project has three specific aims: 1) develop a cloud-based infrastructure which preserves regional autonomy of data, but allows the sharing of parameters of the partially trained deep neural network (including weights and hyperparameters) between regions, to allow transfer learning across domains and tasks; 2) develop a standardized coded model for deep learning approaches in medical applications; and 3) evaluate the effect of training and testing the model across multiple centers and national boundaries, by comparing improvement in performance with cross-institutional training without loss of privacy protection, using metrics of sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and model calibration. Aims 1-3 will be achieved by taking four databases (including, a database of intensive care unit patients with sepsis, a free text corpus of nursing progress notes, voice recordings taken from a public corpus classically used for speaker identification, and a public database of full-face images used for classification of facial expressions) and placing them in the cloud (Google, AWS and Azure) at different geopolitical locations (namely US and Europe) and developing a distributed deep learning architecture that learns to improve its performance by sharing weights across borders, but not sensitive patient data. This project has the potential to make several contributions to the field. First, it will demonstrate that medical data across geopolitical boundaries can be made available in an interoperable manner (using the FHIR standard) and can be used for training of deep learning algorithms in a privacy-preserving manner, thus addressing both the concerns of Health Insurance, Portability and Privacy Act (HIPPA) and interoperability. Secondly, it will provide open-source deep learning algorithms for several medical datasets and data types that can be used across institutions to solve similar problems with some fine-tuning (e.g., via transfer learning). Third, it will provide a set of open-source meta algorithms for transfer learning (across domains and tasks) implemented on the cloud in containers (dockers) that can be downloaded for local use or transferred across the different cloud vendors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some cases, however, these same projects result in negative social, cultural, or health consequences to the local population.  Although these impacts are common and widespread, methods used to assess the social and cultural effects of initiatives (either positive or adverse) have received far less attention than methods to address economic or environmental impacts. Reasons include the usual market-based perspective of economists or policy analysts and the practical challenges encountered when evaluating the broad range of social, cultural, or health effects of a project. <br/><br/>The proposal takes an interdisciplinary perspective to construct better measures of social, cultural, and health effects using methods based in the decision sciences, environmental risk analysis, cultural anthropology, planning and policy evaluation, and psychology and statistics. The underlying premise is that improved measures of less tangible impacts will require improvements in both analytical and deliberative approaches. Key tasks include better understanding and identification of social and cultural impacts, better and more widely accepted metrics for incorporating qualitative or quantitative measures of these effects, and new methods that will successfully address uncertain future impacts, cumulative effects, and community-wide values (in contrast to the individual values favored under current approaches).<br/>  <br/>This 2-year proposal begins with structured interviews with experienced experts to elicit key concerns and barriers to the routine inclusion of social, cultural, and health indicators as part of project evaluations. Phase 2 includes experiments, which will compare the responses of expert and public participants, and involvement by researchers as part of several ongoing case studies that are now being undertaken by federal (or state) regulatory and management government agencies. Phase 3 is a review and revision of project findings in light of the comments of experts drawn from Phase 1, and then the dissemination of results through papers and conferences.<br/><br/>Outcomes of the project will help analysts to better represent and evaluate the community-based health, social, and cultural components of impact assessments, thereby leading to reduced levels of social conflict and more widely acceptable public policy initiatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Disasters magnify the challenges of managing within this environment, especially when the institution is constrained in its ability to accommodate the unique needs of students who are facing significant difficulties after a natural disaster. The short term disruption caused by a disaster can lead to long-term consequences for public institutions, but many of these more pronounced consequences may not be fully attributable to the effects of the disaster, but instead may be a function of the inability of policy frameworks and administrative structures to adapt to the needs of public institutions and policy beneficiaries after extreme events. Especially important are the financial consequences of enrollment loss and the constraints that come with accreditation structures. This study will use administrative interviews and data on student success to examine the role of policy design in post-disaster decisions and its influence on student success. We hope that our findings will motivate discussions among federal education officials and accreditation organization leaders about the ways in which they may consider options that would enable institutions to better support students in their efforts to rebuild their lives and pursue their educational goals.<br/><br/><br/>Theories of publicness, political control, policy implementation, and the politics of attention mostly speak to the challenges faced by public sector leaders in times of relative stability (not in response to extreme events), and many discussions of disaster response are limited to elected officials and/or federal agencies. This project seeks to examine how these dynamics play out in disaster recovery efforts for public higher education institutions and their students. We will use a mixed methods design, with qualitative interviews of administrators and a quantitative analysis of student data. The study site is Lamar University in Beaumont, TX. The administrative interviews focus on the ways in which efforts to accommodate and support those affected by the storm were influenced by accreditation-related constraints (in this case, from the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools) and concerns about the effects on funding streams (tuition revenue, state appropriations, and federal financial aid). The quantitative analysis examines how the decisions immediately following the storm affected student enrollment and persistence and the extent to which these effects vary by student-level risk factors or level of storm damage for the individual's household.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

General-purpose graph algorithms and graph-based machine learning methods have had some success when applied to a number of security problems ranging from detecting malicious websites and compromised devices in computer networks to detecting compromised or inauthentic accounts in social networks.  However, because the existing methods are designed for generic contexts rather than for specific security problems, there is room to improve their performance in detecting bad actors in networks.  Further, in security contexts, there is often a determined adversary trying to evade detection that general-purpose algorithms are not designed to consider, which makes them vulnerable to attack.  This project will develop novel graph inference algorithms that consider unique characteristics of security problems, analyze the spectrum of possible attacks on such algorithms, define measures of their robustness against attack, and develop methods to improve their robustness.  The project team will create and share datasets related to graph-based security analytics along with software that implements their algorithms and robustness measures with both industrial practitioners and other researchers.  They will also mentor undergraduate and graduate students in the research, using the problems and data to support new college courses and Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) outreach activities for K-12 students.<br/><br/>The work focuses on collective classification algorithms that simultaneously label all nodes in a network as malicious or benign.  The first main research thrust involves advancing analytic techniques that combine random walk and loopy belief propagation-based algorithms through local rules that model the joint probabilities of a given node and its neighbors being malicious.  To do this, the team will develop versions of the algorithms that relax assumptions that neighboring nodes have strong homophily, developing characterizations of neighboring nodes' relationships and creating novel Markov Random Field formulations that leverage these characterizations.  The second research thrust will model the attack surface of collective classification algorithms, characterizing the goals and capabilities of attackers, the cost of evasive moves such as creating nodes or edges and generating network activity, and the effect of different goals, capabilities, and levels of evasion on the algorithms' performance.  The third thrust will be to develop methods to identify such evasion by developing attacker-resistant link prediction algorithms and similarity metrics, then mitigate evasion efforts through developing local rule-based techniques that add noise to graphs in ways that confound attacks.  The team will evaluate the metrics and algorithms on datasets from a number of domains, including malicious users in social networks, malicious URLs in the web graph, malicious domains embedded in domain name service redirects, and malicious orders in an e-commerce marketplace.  These problems, and the associated datasets, will be integrated into an existing course on data-driven security and a new graduate seminar course on collective classification.

The National Science Foundation (NSF) GEM program is a cornerstone of NSF's Magnetospheric Physics Program which supports the study of the physics of the magnetosphere and the coupling of the magnetosphere to the atmosphere and to the solar wind. The GEM program focuses on the development of global magnetospheric models. The success of this effort depends on open cooperation and exchange of ideas and the development and sharing of models. Through various data-model challenges, models are compared and validated in an open and constructive process. The means of achieving the open communication and cooperation required for GEM lies largely in the regular GEM workshops. This workshop award supports the science of the program by providing an opportunity for Principal Investigators (PIs) and students present results and discuss outstanding issues in an interactive setting. There are two GEM workshops each year: the week-long GEM Summer workshop in June which includes a student day and the one-day Mini-GEM workshop in December which is held the Sunday before the American Geophysical Union's Fall meeting. This award provides coordination support for both GEM workshops and travel support for approximately 75 students to attend the Summer workshop. <br/><br/>Basic research in magnetospheric physics is a critical component of the National Space Weather Action Plan and associated efforts. The magnetosphere is the dynamic force field protecting Earth from Solar radiation. Space Weather impacts on Earth occur in and propagate through the magnetosphere. The severity of the impacts depends on the condition of the magnetosphere at the time of impact. Scientific modeling of the magnetosphere is critical for building the tools that can transition to operationally relevant models. Another very important component of the GEM workshops is a strong student-oriented educational element. The majority of this award is for support of student participation in the GEM Summer workshops. Most of the student support is directed toward graduate students but may also toward very talented undergraduate students (attending a U.S. university). In large part, the GEM workshops act to mentor the students and facilitate the transition from student to researcher in the science community. Students have the opportunity to participate fully in the focus group sessions and to present their research in poster sessions that enable detailed discussion and interaction with the broader magnetospheric community. The GEM student organization has been formalized with student leaders and a student-only meeting including tutorial lectures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

UPTEMPO aims to increase the number and diversity of highly-effective mathematics teachers in high-need California schools. At SDSU, several impediments prevent high-achieving students from considering mathematics teaching: (1) women and underrepresented minorities often feel that they do not belong in STEM fields; (2) those who are STEM majors rarely engage in authentic teaching experiences that pique their interest in education; and (3) students who are interested in teaching choose not to pursue a teaching career because they must complete and pay for a fifth-year credential program. UPTEMPO activities aim to address each of these impediments. The project will partner with Grossmont College, a nearby community college, to attract new candidates to STEM. To attract STEM majors to teaching, UPTEMPO will create multiple authentic teaching experiences. Experiences will range from tutoring (in a middle school, high school, or community college) to teaching labs for undergraduates enrolled in precalculus at SDSU. Additionally, to support STEM teacher prospects, the project will develop new pathways, also called on-ramps, to expedite SDSU students? ability to earn a mathematics teaching credential. Noyce Interns and Scholars will be mentored by SDSU's Noyce Master Teaching Fellows and other exemplary teachers in partnering school districts. <br/><br/>UPTEMPO will support initiatives to attract (via new on-ramps) and retain (via authentic experiences and research-based coursework) candidates from Grossmont College and San Diego State University. The project aims to produce at least 44 new secondary teachers of mathematics by 2023. Thirty-two Noyce Scholars will be enrolled in SDSU's credential program as post-baccalaureates. The remaining 12 will be undergraduates enrolled in the institution's new 4-year teacher certification program. All Noyce Scholars will participate in teaching experiences in San Diego Unified School District or Sweetwater Union High School District, both of which are high-need school districts that are partnering with UPTEMPO. Given the lack of a single ?best way? to attract and retain teaching candidates, UPTEMPO will provide multiple pathways (or on-ramps) for Noyce Scholars and follow these Scholars through their first three years of teaching. This sustained interaction will provide the field with valuable research regarding the efficacy of specific affordances provided by the different pathways, as well as the ability of these affordances to meet specific candidate needs. The project will also investigate the process of supporting mathematics majors to develop caring perspectives toward students. As such, project could contribute to the diversification of the teaching community coupled with an ongoing supply of excellent teachers of mathematics for K-12 students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, floods can also be described as  a collection of random processes  using statistics in addition to physical modeling.The relationship between flood severity and likelihood (""flood frequency analysis"") has become a centerpiece in flood risk management practice. Changes in land use due to urbanization and climate variability implies that existing data and methods may no longer be valid. Meanwhile, study of the links between dynamic and statistical behavior of  floods  has been hindered by the lack of long-term, high-resolution observations of rainfall, soil moisture, and streamflow. This leaves us with limited understanding of how factors such as soil moisture and river channel dynamics modulate extreme rainfall to produce long-term flood frequency. This research presents a hybrid approach that uses recent advances in hydrometeorological observations, data processing approaches, models, and theory to better understand floods in a changing world. It also proposes several innovative education and outreach initiatives that will reach K-12, undergraduate and graduate students, and instructors using a combination of physical-virtual active learning tools, interactive web-based ""apps,"" and lesson modules to reinforce learning and assess outcomes.<br/><br/>The research will advance understanding of the role of four-dimensional (surface rainfall rate, time, and x,y spatial coordinates) storm structure as a driver of rainfall and flood frequency. The first objective focuses on regional geospatial rainfall structure and its linkages to rainfall and flood frequencies and trends. The second objective focuses on the physical drivers of flood frequency including rainfall, soil moisture, and their interactions. The principal inveatigatgor will use stochastic-dynamic modeling to establish the cross-scale links between flood severity and frequency that have thus far proven elusive. The proposed work will advance understanding of flood variability at multiple, coupled scales and provides tools that leverage modern computing power, regional high-resolution rainfall observations, and distributed computational watershed models. Using a framework for physically-based flood frequency analysis, this research will provide better insights into underlying drivers and their links to nonstationary flood frequency and severity. This research has an education/outreach component to train a diverse and ""data literate"" generation of professionals able to create a flood-resilient nation. Activities and teaching modules will also improve data literacy and geospatial understanding of flood hydrometeorology and the water cycle among a range of audiences including UW-Madison students, K-12 science fair attendees, high school science teachers and students, water resources practitioners, and the public. These initiatives are motivated by recent research showing that diverse teaching approaches including group activities, technology, and real world examples can reinforce learning and attract underrepresented groups to STEM. The proposed work will involve graduate students, undergraduates, and high school educators directly in the development of education and outreach products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, many insects have specific calls which are barriers to mating between species. This diversity is in large part under the control of genes. Patterns of gene expression and regulation during development can also result in specific behaviors. However, it is unclear how differences in behavior relate to genetic differences: what is the contribution of changes in the actual genes relative to that of changes in gene regulation? This remains a fundamental open question of general importance, far beyond the diverse calls of insects. In this research this question is addressed in a katydid species that produces two alternative calls in response to the environment experienced during development. The differences between these calls within a population are due to differences in gene regulation. Population-level differences also occur across the geographic range of this insect, and this variation is largely caused by differences in individual's genes. This allows the assessment of the contributions of both genes and genetic regulation to the diversity of behavior in this species. This project integrates genetics, neurobiology, behavior, and evolution. Its outcomes contribute to the understanding of the genetic foundation of biodiversity and are relevant in many areas outside of animal behavior, including medical research. Broader impacts include training opportunities for students of diverse backgrounds that prepare them for the challenges of careers in life sciences. Outreach activities introduce the public to modern biology research in a relatable study system. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand the genetic underpinnings of the call diversity in Neoconocephalus katydids. The species Neoconocephalus triops undergoes developmental plasticity (DP) that results in two alternative advertisement calls with species-level differences in two temporal properties (pulse rate and verse pattern). DP can be induced reliably by varying the photoperiod before sexual maturation. First, the relevant developmental stages and tissues (central pattern generators, CPG) in the CNS that contribute to the call pattern generation will be identified. Aim 1 identifies the location of the CPGs using lesion experiments, calcium imaging, and selectively heating of individual ganglia. In aim 2, the investigators identify the sensitive phase of phenotype induction by varying the exposure time of short day conditions and analyzing adult call phenotypes. Aim 3 explores the genetic underpinnings of the diversity of call patterns. RNAseq will be conducted using tissues containing the CPGs collected at the relevant times identified in aim 2.  Correlations between phenotypes and differences in gene expression patterns as well as genetic differences among populations will be identified. Comparisons include two call phenotypes of three populations that differ significantly in call pattern and extent of DP. In aim 4, the investigators will manipulate the expression levels of candidate genes identified in aim 3, using RNAi and examine the consequences for call phenotypes, moving from identifying correlations to testing causation. The outcomes provide testable hypotheses about the genetic control of call variation, which plays a significant role in the diversification of this group.  Training and outreach activities are focusing on the public and students of rural areas in MO, KY, and WV, which are traditionally underserved groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the ability to improve radio frequency and microwave wireless functionality is inhibited by the platform-centric model in place today, where capability improvements must be achieved by developing new individual systems. Such improvements must often occur without increasing the size, weight, and power of the system, since increasing transmit energy, signal gain, or spatial diversity will result in larger size, aperture, or power, if not all three. This research seeks to break the platform-centric paradigm by investigating new techniques in dynamic distributed antenna arrays, where individual elements in a distributed antenna array use dynamics in time and space to significantly enhance the system functionality. Such dynamic arrays will lead to improvements of radar systems, enabling greater capabilities for sensing the earth and its atmosphere from satellites, improving target discrimination in military radar, and enabling greater safety on autonomous vehicles. In addition, the project will implement an educational plan for teaching new perspectives of antenna array theory and new antenna array design concepts. The outreach plan will educate under-represented student groups in engineering, both at the college and secondary levels, to help expand STEM education in central Michigan.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to explore the use of spatial and temporal dynamics of distributed antenna arrays to create new modalities for radar and remote sensing. In particular, this research will advance knowledge by exploring theoretical methods of formulating array concepts in terms of a physical antenna array dynamics with waveform dynamics, and will investigate new sensing modalities leveraging dynamic antenna arrays. Recent developments by the PI's group and others have led to dramatically increased connectivity between sensors on mobile platforms such as UAVs and autonomous vehicles. Such connectivity and mobility set the stage for truly distributed sensing capabilities, where a new dimension of control and motion of the array elements can be exploited in innovative ways. This research will explore how spatio-temporal dynamics in such distributed arrays can be formulated, analyzed, implemented, and utilized to create new remote sensing modalities. Specifically, the project has the following objectives: 1) Obtain a systematic theory of spatio-temporal modulation in antenna arrays whose elements are dynamic in space and frequency. This will develop the foundations of a new antenna array theory that incorporates spatial frequency domain antenna analysis and spatio-temporal dynamics to open a new dimension of control enabled by dynamic movement of the array elements. 2) Explore the capabilities enabled by dynamic antenna arrays for new radar and remote sensing measurements. This will lead to orders-of-magnitude improvements in the angular resolution of radar measurements, and will enable the creation of new radar measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interaction often leads to exotic, often unexpected, phases of matter. To study these phases and phenomena, it is important to minimize the imperfections, such as impurities and defects. The goal is to experimentally explore and understand the new phases that arise in electron systems with the least amount of imperfections. Results of the research are communicated through publications and conference presentations to the specialized as well as general science and engineering communities. While the subject of this work is fundamental, progress in this area benefits society in the long term as it may lead to novel, transformative concepts for electronic devices and information processing systems, such as a quantum computer, whose operation relies on quantum and/or interaction phenomena. The project also incorporates a high quality and comprehensive educational component as it includes the education of students in critical, state-of-the art areas of science and technology, including the fabrication, characterization, and physics of very high-quality, thin-film semiconductor structures. Well-trained students in these fields are invaluable resources for the US as well as for the rest of the world. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract:<br/>This project encompasses an experimental investigation of electron interaction physics in high-quality, quantum-confined semiconductor structures. The research includes studies of both fabrication, via the molecular beam epitaxy technique, and of the electronic transport properties at low temperatures and high magnetic fields where electron correlation phenomena dominate. The emphasis of the work is on high-quality two-dimensional electron systems confined to selectively-doped AlAs and bilayer GaAs quantum wells. The two-dimensional electrons in AlAs have parameters that are very different from those of the standard two-dimensional electrons in GaAs: they have a much larger and anisotropic effective mass, a much larger effective Lande g-factor, and they occupy multiple conduction band valleys. The bilayer electron systems in GaAs double quantum wells, on the other hand, are specifically designed so that the measured electronic properties of one layer could be used to probe the physics of the other layer. An example is a system where the composite fermions in a layer with high density are used to probe a Wigner crystal formed in an adjacent low-density layer. Both AlAs and bilayer GaAs two-dimensional electrons thus provide crucial and important test-beds for new many-body physics. Several exotic phases of interacting two-dimensional electron systems are studied during the course of this project; these include the fractional quantum Hall effect, composite fermions, Wigner crystal, and stripe phases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Online recommendation systems, search engines and personalized medicine are just a few examples of  systems that use Machine Learning (ML) algorithms at their core. The long term success of ML as a field relies on transforming it into an easily usable, seamless technology with rigorous, provable guarantees on performance. Further, to have a positive impact on society, ML technologies need to be equipped to handle the social challenges that accompany any large multi-user systems. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to make socially-responsible ML a readily accessible black-box technology that is applicable in large multi-user interactive systems.  In particular, the project focuses on three concrete challenges. The first challenge is to make ML a plug-and-play technology by automating the process of designing task specific ML algorithms. The second challenge is to develop ML methods for modern applications such as predicting user preferences in social networks, where data is evolving and complexly interconnected. The third challenge is to develop theory and algorithms for recommendation systems that are socially responsible and do not polarize its users. <br/><br/>In recent years, exploring inherent connections between probability theory and sequential prediction problems have lead to a unifying theory and algorithm design principles for online learning. This CAREER project will build on these developments. Using the so called Burkholder method from probability theory and advances in the field of mathematical programming, the project will aim at automating the process of designing new and effective online learning algorithms. Building on the recently developed idea of online relaxations, the project will introduce novel methodology for designing computationally efficient algorithms for learning from interconnected data points. Finally, using and extending ideas from classical statistics to deal with control and nuisance variables, the project will develop new methods for recommender systems that can avoid polarizing users. The CAREER program will advance STEM education by developing new educational components related to ML. ``Machine Learning for the Masses'' workshops will be co-organized with Women In Computing at Cornell aimed at involving women and underrepresented minorities and exposing undergraduates to research and job opportunities in the field of ML during their formative years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is however less recognized that sea level rise can push water tables above the land surface to flood low-lying depressions. Lakes and wetlands that form by groundwater flooding expose connected aquifers to direct, continuous evaporation, which can result in substantial losses of water resources. Impacts from groundwater flooding and evaporation will be most intense on low-lying carbonate islands, where evaporated freshwater is replaced by seawater that percolates through the bedrock. These models incorporate impact of climate and predicted that lakes should remain fresh, and groundwater resources continuous, beneath islands in humid regions. In arid regions, lakes would be hypersaline, and much fresh groundwater would be replaced by seawater. In contrast to expectations, modern lakes that are formed by groundwater flooding in the arid southern Bahamas islands have salinities that range from fresh to hypersaline. This paradox between modeled and observed lake salinity underscores our lack of understanding of how groundwater flooding impacts island water resources. During this project, new field data will be collected, and new transient modeling tools will be developed, to test the overarching hypothesis that how groundwater flooding will impact island water resources. We will test the impact of lake area relative to its groundwater contributing area, the degree of connectivity between lakes and the ocean, and dynamic interactions with climate and sea level change on this process. The results of this study should improve predictions of freshwater resource loss of Small Island Developing States (SIDS) from groundwater flooding, perhaps the primary environmental factor triggering their loss of habitability. The modeling tools to be developed as part of this project will be freely distributed to the hydrological community. A field hydrogeology curricular exercise, with learning outcomes of quantitative coastal hydrology, will be developed to be used by the more than 100 student groups that visit the Gerace Research Centre (base of operation for this project) each year. Project results will be presented as part of a guest lecturer series at the University of the Bahamas and at international conferences. The project will enhance human resources by introducing coastal hydrology to 2 geology PhD students, and one civil engineering postdoctoral researcher at Michigan Tech. Each PI will work with their institution's diversity office to ensure that these positions are effectively advertised to under-represented groups.<br/><br/><br/>Evaporation of lakes and wetlands that form on islands by groundwater inundation reorganizes groundwater flow paths and lowers water tables. Impacts from groundwater inundation and evaporation will be most intense on low-lying carbonate islands, where the Ghyben-Herzberg relationship results in losses from freshwater lenses (the primary freshwater resource) being 40x the lowering of the water table. Primary controls on groundwater inundation will be sea-level rise and island topography, but impacts to freshwater resources could be moderated by climate (precipitation, and evaporation), aquifer permeability, ratio of groundwater contributing area to lake surface area, and distance between the lake and coast. During this project, new field data will be collected, and new transient modeling tools will be developed, to test the overarching hypothesis that groundwater inundation will reduce freshwater lens volumes through interactions of lake area relative to its groundwater contributing area, degree of connectivity between lakes and ocean, and dynamic interactions with climate and sea level change. Hypothesis testing will take a three-pronged approach. First, DEMs of San Salvador Island, Bahamas, will characterize lake hydrogeological setting (catchment/lake area ratios). Field observations of hydrogeological parameters and weather data will be used to estimate groundwater fluxes and lake evaporation; chemical and isotopic compositions of groundwater, lake water, and precipitation will be used to estimate recharge thresholds and lake water sources (ocean, groundwater, recharged precipitation). Second, a package for simulating dynamic flow and solute transport between lakes and groundwater will be developed and integrated into the SEAWAT/MODFLOW model in cllaboration with USGS. The model will be parameterized with observational data collected on San Salvador Island. Third, transient responses of island freshwater lenses to multiple sea level rise, climate change, and lake formation scenarios will be tested with the newly developed numerical modeling tool. Simulations will determine the nature of relationships between freshwater lens volumes and sea level, climatic variables, and island-lake hydrogeological settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This phenomenon means that estimates of earthquake hazard based on the assumption that faults fail individually can underestimate the size of the largest possible earthquake in a region, and in turn the level of seismic hazard. The November 14, 2016 magnitude 7.8 Kaikoura earthquake in the northern South Island, New Zealand, stands out as one of the most complex earthquakes known, with rupture of the ground surface observed on more than 20 faults. The earthquake was followed by tens of thousands of aftershocks, and it also triggered a number of what are called ""slow slip events"" - fault slip occurring over days to months instead of seconds to minutes like most earthquakes. The Kaikoura earthquake is the latest in a series of damaging earthquakes in the northern part of the South Island in New Zealand that have struck in this decade. This project will examine several key questions related to the complicated geologic evolution of this region. This project will take advantage of data and results from a broad range of studies that have been carried out over the past two decades. It will also utilize seismic data from temporary arrays that were deployed to record aftershock and were operated, in part, with support of RAPID funding from NSF. The tasks of this project are to image the three-dimensional seismic velocity and attenuation structure, to relocate earthquakes that occurred in the region with high-precision, and to determine the fault slip geometry using the aftershock locations. This work will contribute to our understanding of how multiple-fault failure occurs in large earthquakes, thereby contributing to improving seismic hazard estimation. The work will be carried out in close collaboration with New Zealand scientists from GNS Science and Victoria University of Wellington. In addition, as part of the broader impacts, this project will mentor a female postdoctoral scholar.<br/><br/>The November 14, 2016 Mw 7.8 Kaikoura earthquake in the northern South Island, New Zealand, stands out as one of the most complex seismic events known. Surface rupture has been mapped on at least 21 faults. Post-seismic slow slip events were triggered over a broad area, including substantial slip on the South Island megathrust underlying the activated crustal faults. The Kaikoura earthquake is the latest in a series of damaging earthquakes in the Canterbury and Marlborough regions of the South Island that have struck in this decade, starting with the Darfield and Christchurch earthquakes of 2010 and 2011, continuing with the Seddon and Lake Grassmere earthquakes of 2013, and culminating in the 2016 Kaikoura earthquake. We note that the Mw 7.1 Darfield earthquake was also a complex, multi-fault rupture.This project will examine several hypotheses related to the complex tectonics of this region of transition from subduction to strike-slip. The proposed study will take advantage of data and results from a broad range of studies that have been carried out in this region over the past two decades, and utilize data from temporary aftershock arrays supported in part by NSF through RAPID awards. The main analysis tools are seismic velocity and attenuation tomography that incorporate recent and planned methodological developments, high-precision earthquake relocation, and focal mechanism analysis. The work will be carried out in close collaboration with New Zealand scientists from GNS Science and Victoria University of Wellington and will engage a female postdoctoral scholar in the data analysis and interpretation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, the project will use computer modeling and flight simulations as mechanisms to provide unique entrées to STEM and STEM careers for predominately underrepresented elementary and middle school students in the Rocky Mountain and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States. Named for the first African-American woman to receive a pilot's license, the Bessie Coleman Project builds on extant knowledge and understandings of complex systems in aviation and aerospace to develop, implement, and test the impact of a culturally specific, place-based, thematic curriculum and extension activities on youth engaged in informal STEM learning programs related to computer science. This focus on the intersectionality of computer science learning and 21st century information and communications technology (ICT) skill preparation is a national priority at the forefront of educational reform. Research has shown strong evidence that computer coding can motivate student learning and broaden student opportunities in STEM. Likewise, research has shown encouraging benefits of students learning coding as a pathway to develop computational thinking skills. K-12 schools, academic institutions, and informal STEM education sectors across the country are particularly interested in effective strategies to prepare teachers and students in computer science and coding, particularly youth from underrepresented groups in STEM. This project explores the potential and impact of the Bessie Coleman Project as an effective approach to address this national need among three critically underrepresented groups in computer science in four different states. The findings will advance knowledge applicable for both formal and informal contexts.<br/><br/>Over the three-year project duration, approximately 1,000 rural and urban elementary and middle school students will engage in a broad range of project activities - from 3D computer modeling and game design (grades 4-5), to flight simulation using drones and Raspberry Pi (grades 6-8). The students are predominately of Native American, African-American/Black, Hispanic and Asian descent, participating in after school computer science clubs and summer camps at project sites in Colorado, Maryland, Pennsylvania, and Wyoming. Expeditions to air and space museums, opportunities to engage with field experts, guest speakers, and other extended learning opportunities are integral to the program. Forty-two classroom teachers and 12 informal educators and staff from Boys & Girls Clubs and Makerspaces will receive training to implement and facilitate the program in their site locations.  An iterative research design is used to investigate the three overarching research questions: (a) What learning experiences involving emerging technologies effectively enable diverse populations of students to gain familiarity and relevant competencies with these technologies, and what factors influence the outcomes of the learning experiences? (b) What culturally-responsive instructional and curricular practices and models, including place-based education, used by teachers enhance student understanding of and interest in STEM occupations, and what factors influence the outcomes of the practices and models? and (c) In what roles and in what ways do business and industry workforce members (i.e., STEM professionals) motivate students to become aware of, interested in, and prepared for STEM careers in the STEM workforce and support teachers in efforts to promote STEM workforce awareness and interest? Formal and summative evaluations are carried out by an Advisory Board and an external evaluator. The research and project findings are locally and nationally disseminated through libraries, a resource guide, a blog, community involvement, conference presentations and journal publications. Ultimately, the project endeavors to increase students' computational thinking abilities, STEM interest and motivation, and persistence in STEM career pathways, especially in computer science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While large, destructive ruptures occur only rarely, much smaller events, often called microseismicity, occur much more often, with the vast majority of them not felt by people. However, the surface motion due to these much smaller events can be recorded by sensitive instruments called seismometers and analyzed to reveal their location and properties. In fact, microseismicity provides us with a unique window into the stress environment, structure, and physical properties of the Earth's crust and their changes over time.  In California, for example, most of microseismicity occurs in the same depth range that is expected to host large, destructive events. However, the ground motions recorded for the microseismicity are currently analyzed based on relatively simple models of earthquake sources from several decades ago. The rapid recent progress in computing, laboratory experiments, and observations has enabled us to create much more realistic numerical models of how these microearthquake ruptures might occur.  This study will use new numerical models of microseismicity to advance understanding and improve information about the properties of the crust, gained through the important window of microseismicity studies, while advancing our understanding of fault mechanics and of realistic sources of microseismicity. The resulting insight into earthquake physics will contribute to the physics-based simulation capability for seismic hazard analysis. These results may benefit the society at large.<br/><br/>The project will advance understanding of several scientifically and practically important types of microearthquake sources, such as foreshock-like events, repeating earthquakes, ruptures of heterogeneous patches, and fluid-injection-induced events, by producing and analyzing the synthetic far-field seismograms of their dynamic models. The goals are to (i) determine how well the synthetic spectra are fit with the currently used expressions based on the simple models, determine source parameters using the existing seismological approaches, and study how they relate to the actual source properties that can be determine from these models; (ii) look for seismological signatures that would indicate that the sources in question are more complex than the basic seismological assumptions, and potentially distinguish between several characteristic types of sources; and (iii) investigate the possibility of creating alternative approaches to seismological source-parameter estimates for such sources, using models more consistent with the specific seismological signatures identified.  The study will examine whether different types of sources can be associated with a typical set of parameters in the currently used spectral fitting expressions, or whether some of them require more advanced approaches such as two-corner-frequency functions.  It will also look at how the spectral properties for different types of sources vary over the focal sphere and consider differences between P- and S-wave spectra, which may be different for different types of sources. The research will potentially enable observational scientists to conduct more detailed seismological studies in areas with suitable station coverage, knowledge of the structure, and data quality. The results of the proposed activities will be broadly disseminated. Several graduate and undergraduate students, including from groups that are underrepresented in science, will gain valuable research and teaching experience carrying out the proposed interdisciplinary activities. In addition, a wider group of students will be educated about the issues involved in this research through course projects in two relevant courses taught by the researcher.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will be conducted at the French Paleolithic site of Pech de l'Azé IV.  While evidence for human use of fire appears to extend back to around 1 million years ago, several lines of evidence suggest that fire was not used regularly until much later, at around 300,000 to 400,000 years ago.  More recent evidence shows that the frequency of fire use, at least for some Neandertal groups, was not constant, however, and that it actually decreased during colder periods of the Pleistocene.  Perhaps this is because they lacked the ability to start fires themselves and thus had to acquire it from natural wildfires, which were more prevalent during warmer periods.  Nonetheless, this pattern implies that fire for warmth or cooking was not necessary for their survival.  This, in turn, raises the question of exactly how did they use fire when it was available. The research is significant because it examines the fundamental relationship between technology and human behavior and sets it into a deep chronological context.<br/><br/>The research to be conducted at Pech de l'Azé IV is designed to obtain the maximum amount of information concerning the numerous hearth features at the site.  Much of this information comes from newly-developed analytical techniques that can determine from the sediment and associated artifacts the temperatures of ancient fires and the fuels used, as well as being able to detect the presence of organic materials.  In order to apply these methods, this project will significantly enhance the precision and accuracy of current excavation techniques by removing blocks of intact sediment from the site and excavating it under highly controlled techniques in a laboratory setting.  This approach, developed specifically for this project, will allow the researchers to identify individual hearths and to establish geochemical, geophysical, and sedimentological signatures of them that reflect how they were used.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many practical applications, it is required that these waves propagate through nonreciprocal channels/devices able to exhibit different responses when source and observation points are interchanged. This is the case of isolators that protect sources and antennas from high-power reflections, circulators able to distribute signals to different outputs, or Faraday rotators that control the polarization of light. These components are fundamental building blocks for telecommunications, defense, health care, and space industries. Unfortunately, breaking reciprocity usually requires bulky and costly magnetic materials that are not compatible with integrated circuits. This project proposes novel approaches to break and engineer reciprocity at the micro/nano-scale by exploiting exciting properties of two-dimensional materials without requiring external magnetic fields. The findings will be applied to develop low-cost, compact, and highly-efficient nonreciprocal platforms that enable novel functionalities and are compatible with integrated circuits and other optoelectronic components. The main goal is to establish a new paradigm for nonreciprocal devices, lessening the dependence on magnetic materials and exploiting unusual responses to reshape many areas of the coming technology. The educational and outreach efforts will focus on engaging Hispanic students, ranging from K-12 to college, in science, technology, engineering and math. Summer fellowships will foster the participation of undergraduate Hispanic students in a research project about nonreciprocal antennas, allowing graduate, undergraduate, and high school students to interact and share knowledge and experiences learnt by implementing similar concepts at different frequencies. The organization of a workshop about reciprocity will bring together top experts in the field with graduate and Hispanic undergraduate and high-school students, enabling technical discussions and broadening the impact of this exciting topic on all society.<br/>  <br/>This project combines and exploits unique properties of two-dimensional materials to break and manipulate time-reversal symmetry in the absence of magnetic bias. First, nonreciprocal responses far beyond what is currently attainable using magneto-optics effects will be realized by pumping two-dimensional materials subjected to uniform strain with circularly-polarized light. This platform will permit to investigate the response of many systems under effective magnetic bias much larger than those attained in common laboratories and will enable the practical development of strain engineering. Such responses will be applied to realize Faraday rotators and nonreciprocal hyperbolic/phase profile metasurfaces, enabling functionalities such as one way giant optical forces and nonreciprocal beam steering/lensing. Second, the ultrafast field effect of two-dimensional materials will be exploited to judiciously modulate in space and time their electric properties. Spatiotemporal modulations will be applied to realize low-loss, efficient, and integrated nonreciprocal photonic and plasmonic platforms able to enhance the spectrum efficiency and data-rate in the telecommunication industry. The technology proposed in this project is low-cost, compatible with integrated circuits, and aims to significantly advance the current frontiers in the field of nonreciprocity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This challenge is a direct consequence of the devastating effects that disasters can produce on societies. These effects impact all facets of the socio-technical processes at the core of modern life. Disaster mitigation, preparedness, and response plans must be improved to minimize vulnerabilities, and to ensure that what is known can be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of future efforts. Disaster logistics should be a whole-society effort, where the civic and public sectors participate to minimize the negative impacts of disasters. Disaster researchers have already established that the civic society plays a major role in all aspects of the response to extreme events, from search and rescue and relief distribution, to rebuilding efforts. They are often credited with being the first respondents due to their proximity to the impacted area. These groups are a very heterogeneous collection of formal and informal organizations with different structures and levels of expertise in disaster response. Previous field work has also shown that the civic society can provide effective response to their communities by means of leveraging their connections to access logistical resources and efficiently respond to the disaster. Frequently, these groups delivered relief supplies faster, and more effectively, than any of the large relief organizations. On the other hand, the activities of some groups can prove troublesome, such as the gathering of donations of non-priority supplies. The reality is that the majority of the donations that arrive at a disaster site are non-priority goods that severely complicate disaster response efforts. The main goal of this project is to identify lessons, both positive and negative, that the disaster community should learn from the experiences of the civic society during the responses to Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria. Identifying these lessons will help future disaster responders to conduct more effective operations, and reduce the impacts of disasters on local communities, the economy, and the environment. This project studies the socio-technical factors that hamper the integration of Non-Established Relief Groups (NERGs) efforts and that of relief efforts that come from the outside to help. In addition, the research provides crucial knowledge about the role that NERGs play in the humanitarian logistics, and about how best to structure the interactions among the established groups, the official response and the NERGs, for maximum effectiveness. The data collected about the difficulties of relief groups to deliver supplies will help identify mechanisms to prevent these problems from happening in future disasters. The research documents the logistic structures that emerge in support of relief/early recovery efforts after a major extreme event and enable future model development based on these different relief approaches. The findings enhance theoretical understandings of organizations participating in these extreme event environments. <br/><br/>The research focuses on both formal and informal mechanisms through which NERGs identify, gather, deliver, and distribute relief items. Data collection includes short and informal as well as in-depth interviews with individuals involved in the logistics efforts, at all levels of action (e.g., international, national, re-gional, local, and community levels), from NERGs, and at all levels of power. In order to gain better understandings about the motivations behind physical donations, the team creates a directory of donation drives taking place across the US to support the relief efforts. The goal is to conduct longitudinal tracking of their operations, and perform in-depth studies of how these efforts are created, their evolution, and their decision-making patterns. This effort serves as the basis for more in-depth behavioral research. The researchers promote multidisciplinary collaboration, engages undergraduate and graduate students,and disseminate and integrate research findings into disaster courses.

Depending upon the accepted date for this process, the consequences of the human adoption of fire as a tool for cooking, warmth, protection from predators, and countless other uses are profound. Yet despite indications from anatomical, genetic, and primate data that human dependence upon fire evolved early (~1.7 million years ago), critical examinations of the evidence for fire in the archaeological record indicate not only that its origins are significantly later (~1.0 million), but that its use, for all time periods prior to approximately 45,000 years ago, was only sporadic. This has led to the hypothesis that human ancestors previous to this period, including the Neanderthals of Late Pleistocene Europe, were not obligate fire users and did not have the ability to make fire but only to use the fire they found on the landscape resulting from natural lighting strikes. This issue could have contributed to the replacement of European Neanderthal populations by modern humans from Africa at this time. The multidisciplinary team created by Dr. Gilbert Tostevin & Dr. Gilliane Monnier, both of the University of Minnesota, along with colleagues in Montenegro, Serbia, Spain, France, Canada, and Israel, will test this hypothesis by studying the frequency and context of fire use throughout one of the longest archaeological sequences in Europe, at Crvena Stijena Rock Shelter in Montenegro. This project trains 20 students from all over the Balkans in high-resolution archaeological, geological, and cultural heritage 3D digital methods. Montenegro in particular needs to train a generation of archaeologists, since they lost their only archaeology faculty (in Belgrade, Serbia) when they became independent. The project will both train professional archaeologists as well as engage in public outreach events, such as the yearly Dani Nauka (""Days of Science"") events run by the Montenegrin government.<br/><br/>Investigating Neanderthal control of fire with extant archaeological data is difficult, since geological processes within sites frequently erase the physical evidence of fire (through the dissolution of the ash, charcoal, and burnt sediment which make up hearths). As such, it is hard to distinguish between a real absence of fire and the mere absence of evidence. Newer techniques recently made available to archaeological scientists, however, are able to recognize microscopic evidence for fire even when it is no longer visible macroscopically. This multidisciplinary project is designed around the application of these new techniques for the analysis of the context of Neanderthal use of fire against the 40,000 year occupation of the site before the appearance of modern humans in the region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation project will study cranial anatomy in a number of primate species, taking into account trajectories of growth and development, and use those data to reconstruct the growth and development trajectories of ancestral species. The project will advance knowledge about primate adaptation and life history, and will also generate novel shape measurement tools for studying growth, development and anatomy that will be useful across a number of biological disciplines. Undergraduate students will participate in the processing and analysis of shape measurements, thereby teaching them technical skills in geometric morphometrics, mathematics, and statistical analysis. The project will also support public science outreach activities to share these biological concepts and methodological advances with a broader audience. <br/><br/>The objective of this investigation is to examine how evolution has shaped craniofacial growth and development to produce the morphological diversity observed in catarrhines. Geometric morphometric methods will be used to measure an ontogenetic cranial series of 26 extant catarrhine species, from which trajectories of ontogenetic shape change will be calculated. To address ancestral morphologies, this project will reconstruct the cranial ontogenetic trajectory of the last common ancestor (LCA) of all extant catarrhines, as well as those of the LCA of cercopithecoids, hominoids, and hominins, allowing for a comparison of ancestral trajectories with those of extant taxa. As adult morphologies are largely the product of patterns of growth and development, these ancestral ontogenetic trajectories will be used to make determinations about the cranial shapes of adult catarrhine ancestors. This project will also address the role of cranial size in the production of adult morphologies through an evaluation of the hypothesis of size as a 'line of least evolutionary resistance,' whereby size changes may be a first step in adaptation and diversification, with size responding more quickly than shape to environmental change. Using the latest advances in phylogenetic comparative methods, this hypothesis will be tested through direct comparisons of vectors of ontogenetic shape change in the catarrhine skull, and by examining the catarrhine phylogeny for rate shifts in the evolution of cranial size and in cranial size-shape relationships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Improving the cybersecurity environment for small businesses benefits businesses directly through costs savings that result when threats, and corresponding downtime are avoided, and earnings realized with uninterrupted business operations. The public benefits more broadly since it is most often their data, and their bank accounts, that are compromised when a system is hacked or breached. To address these challenges, this project at Mt Hood Community College (MHCC) in Oregon is designed to advance efforts to support the statewide small business cybersecurity environment through Cooperative Local Internships as a Novel Innovation in Cybersecurity (CLINIC). CLINIC will create the infrastructure for ongoing efforts at the college to produce highly qualified technicians in response to local and regional workforce demands, and further support work in the field by creating a cybersecurity toolbox geared towards the needs of small businesses. The CLINIC project aims to begin the process to answer the following long-term research question: How, and in what ways, does providing the small business community with access to a better trained cybersecurity workforce, in conjunction with cybersecurity resources, impact the small business cybersecurity environment? Within the scope of this capacity building project, the Co-PIs will examine two smaller sub-questions: (1) How, and in what ways, does the CLINIC internship model improve alignment between the cybersecurity program and workforce demand? and (2) Does providing support and technical assistance to small businesses increase the efficacy of cybersecurity toolbox resources?<br/><br/>The CLINIC internship will provide students the opportunity to use the tools and resources, particularly a self-assessment tool, in a guided, real-life environment. The existing cybersecurity program offerings and career pathway will be refined to include a small business cybersecurity option, featuring stackable cybersecurity credentials for small business environments that double as both cybersecurity associate degree program requirements and stand-alone certifications. An expanded survey of Oregon small businesses will result in continued alignment of project and program components and allow feedback to inform project activities continually refined through the external evaluation process. This project will utilize the evidence-based approaches of career pathways and internships to contribute to, and underpin, a broader effort to transform the regional small business cybersecurity environment through a multi-pronged approach that increases technicians in the workforce, and connects the workforce with stackable small business cybersecurity certifications. The project will examine how and in what ways self-assessment tools are utilized by small businesses to prevent and respond to cybersecurity threats, how having access to these tools in combination with a cybersecurity literate workforce impacts the business environment with respect to cybersecurity, and how this project may be best replicated in other settings through an evaluation of the utility of the deliverables.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current supply chain networks, financial networks and other industries have complex interconnected structures, where the performance of one participant can affect the performance of the entire system.  In such cases, systemic risk arises when the failure of one supplier or financial institution cascades through the network, which can be costly to overall welfare. This award supports a fundamental understanding of incentives that manage network vulnerabilities, mitigate systemic risk, and resolve failures, while allowing for profit-maximizing behavior of individual participants. The interdisciplinary nature of this research will create new channels of communications between academics, practitioners, and policy makers, leading to synergistic efficiencies in the design of effective policies. The accompanying educational plan aims to broaden STEM interest in stochastic networks through hands-on activities based on lab curricula and digital libraries, and to provide opportunities for underrepresented communities.<br/><br/>This research will build a strategic decision-making framework encompassing a broad class of networks, and will develop techniques to provide timely solutions for systemic risk mitigation. The framework will model the reaction of agents in the network as their joint decision-making process adapts to shocks and failures, and account for agents' facing incomplete information on the state of the network.  The proposed research fills an important gap in the network literature, which mostly consider agents that both mechanically follow pre-specified agreements and transparently observe the entire network.  The analytical infrastructure leverages and extends state-of-the-art techniques from stochastic analysis, game theory, and risk management. The project will develop mathematical techniques to recover Nash equilibria in constrained, weighted, and directed stochastic networks through the solution of non-linear discontinuous functional fixed-point equations.

Most of these disorders arise due to disruptions in the regulation of protein networks (called protein signaling complexes) that control the strength of the connections (called synapses) that allow neurons to communicate with each other.  Using sophisticated computer modeling and super-resolution microscopes, this project seeks to produce significant new molecular-level understanding of the dynamic organization, in both time and space, of these critical protein complexes. This understanding could lead to the design of new treatments for learning and memory disorders.  Furthermore, the research studies planned will provide current and future biomedical engineering students with the multidisciplinary training required to enter careers in the rapidly growing fields of biotechnology and biomedical engineering. Student skills will be enhanced by participation in cross-disciplinary engineering design teams, expanded interdisciplinary research opportunities for undergraduates and graduate students, and opportunities to engage in entrepreneurial activities. The proposed educational curriculum and outreach activities are expected to increase public awareness of the application of STEM disciplines to meet current national health needs.<br/><br/>The project's objective is to quantitatively describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of protein signaling complexes that determine the strength of neuronal synaptic connections, which are mediated by two glutamate-gated ion channels (AMPAR receptors and NMDA receptors).  The objective is driven by the rationale that elucidating the mechanisms of protein signaling complex formation and regulation is an important step toward identifying targets for pharmaceutical intervention in learning and memory disorders.  The Research Plan is organized around 3 aims:  1) Experimentally measure protein-protein interaction dynamics of a large number of interacting proteins through literature mining and developing a new method to rapidly measure protein binding kinetics; 2)  Construct computational models of NMDAR and AMPAR regulation to quantify the impact of various mechanisms on NMDA and AMPAR localization and identify parameters that need to be further characterized; 3) Quantitatively measure protein complex formation using labeling methods in conjunction with standard immune-labeling techniques to image protein complexes with single molecule localization super-resolution microscopy. The Educational Plan is organized around 2 aims:  1) Create a set of inquiry-based learning modules to teach fundamental principles of transport to K-12 students that will be presented to students in rural schools in Indiana and Ohio and the urban Purdue Polytechnic High School; 2) Create a multidisciplinary educational pathway for current and future Purdue students to obtain careers in fields of biomolecular detection, biotechnology, and technology development by designing and implementing new courses for undergraduate and graduate students that focus on biomolecular engineering and transport phenomena with special emphasis on the intersection of engineering, chemistry, and biology and developing expanded research and entrepreneurship activities that provide experiential learning opportunities that supplement skill attainment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While in the offline world we are attuned to subtle conversational signals that help us align our intentions and expectations with those of our interlocutors, online we have not yet developed an acute sensibility for such (often muted) meta-conversational signals.  This project will develop a computational framework for (1) reconstructing aspects of this lost meta-conversational channel in online goal-oriented discussion; for (2) detecting warning signs of misalignment and conversational failure; and for (3) developing mechanisms aimed at keeping at-risk conversations on track. This work introduces new methods for tracking the balance of conversational behavior of interlocutors throughout a conversation.

Despite this extensive empirical progress, however, a satisfactory understanding of their behavior is still missing.  As neural networks enter more and more into human-facing services (self-driving cars, medical diagnostics, etc.), this status quo and in particular its safety ramifications becomes worrisome.  This project aims for a theoretical understanding of the foundations of neural networks, divided into three pieces: (a) the representation question regarding which phenomena can be succinctly approximated by neural networks; (b) the optimization question of how to efficiently fit neural networks to data; and (c) the generalization question on why neural networks can fit not only the data they have seen but also the data they have not seen.  Developing this understanding will form the core of this project's three broader impacts: (1) the research component will aim to improve safety and reliability of user-facing deployments of neural networks; (2) as an educational component, the research will be simplified and incorporated into freely available course notes; (3) the award supports two outreach efforts co-founded by the PI: UIUC-ML, a university-wide ML seminar; and the midwest ML symposium, a yearly midwest ML gathering.<br/><br/>In more detail, the technical focus of this project, divided into the three learning theoretic topics above, is as follows. The core representation question is: what makes neural network representation special?  In more detail, the proposed representation questions are firstly to characterize the power gained by adding a single layer to a network, and secondly to characterize the representation properties of recurrent neural networks, namely neural networks which evolve their state along with a time series they consume.  Next comes the topic of optimization, where the key mystery is how neural networks manage to perfectly fit their data with simple iterative descent schemes, despite the apparent nonconvexity of the problem.  The plan here is to establish an even stronger property: these iterative schemes manage to output networks which not only fit their data, but do so confidently, in the classical sense of margin theory.  Finally, the proposal closes with the topic of generalization.  The first goal is to develop refined generalization bounds to the point that they can be algorithmically enforced via effective regularization schemes, and secondarily to apply these techniques to the fitting of neural networks to probability distributions, specifically the problem of training Generative Adversarial Networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

S. universities and working towards either their Master's degree or a Doctorate) to attend the 2018 International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces (IUI 2018), to be held March 7-11 in Tokyo, Japan, and to participate in a full-day Student Consortium (workshop) that will be held on March 9.  Sponsored by ACM, the annual IUI conferences represent the growing interest in next-generation intelligent interactive user interfaces.  Attracting 200-300 attendees, they are the premier forum where researchers from academia and industry worldwide who work at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) come together to exchange insights and to present outstanding research and applications whose goal is to make the computerized world a more amenable place.  Unlike traditional AI the focus is not so much on making the computer smart all by itself, but rather on making the interaction between computers and people smarter; and unlike traditional HCI, there is a focus on solutions that involve large amounts of knowledge and emerging technologies such as natural language understanding, brain-computer interfaces, and gesture recognition. To this end, IUI encourages contributions not only from computer science but also from related fields such as psychology, behavioral science, cognitive science, computer graphics, design, the arts, etc.  IUI 2018 will be the 23rd conference in the series; more information about the conference is available online at http://iui.acm.org/2018.  This funding will enable attendance at the IUI conference by students who might otherwise be unable to do so for financial reasons.  It will enhance the educational experience of funded participants, by bringing them into contact with leading researchers in the field and by exposing them to the lively discussion during the course of the conference that often leads to opportunities for career advancement.  The quality of the conference itself will be enhanced as well, thanks to a broadening of the base of institutions represented and increased diversity of participants.  The rich exchange of ideas at IUI has previously proven to be a valuable source of ideas for future research, as well as leading to collaborative efforts; this funding will extend the opportunities for collaboration and provide intellectual stimulus to programs that have previously sent few or no representatives to this conference.  The organizing committee has undertaken to proactively recruit student participants from schools that have not traditionally been well represented in the IUI community.  Women and students who are members of underrepresented groups will be particularly encouraged to participate.  To further assure diversity, no more than two students will be accepted from any given institution.<br/><br/>The IUI 2018 Student Consortium will build on the success of previous such events.  The heart of the Consortium will be a full-day workshop on March 9.  Student trainees will be afforded exposure to their new research community by giving a 20-30 presentation on their work and receiving feedback from peers and a panel of senior researchers.  A group lunch and dinner will encourage social interaction among the student cohort and informal personal interaction with the mentors.  The students' work will also be featured during the main conference in a poster session, where they will gain additional experience explaining their work to others in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the actions of such organizations during crisis situations and recovery efforts is critical to preparing for future natural disasters. Nonetheless, there is only limited research into their role and their coordination with federal, state, and local governments. Focusing on the aftermath of hurricanes Harvey and Irma, this project will address important questions in the field of political science. In particular, it will illuminate how organizations identify gaps in government services, how they coordinate their efforts with government, and why these efforts prove effective or ineffective. The conclusions drawn from this research will contribute to improved coordination between government and private/non-profit organizations during future natural disasters.<br/><br/>The supplementation of state capacity by non-state actors is a recurring, although understudied, phenomenon within the United States. While scholars such as Jacob Hacker have explored the role of non-state entities in providing social welfare benefits, most research on the non-state provision of services has focused on underdeveloped states in the Global South. In this project, we redirect scholarly attention to the role of private providers by addressing two key questions: 1) During times of crisis, how do non-state entities identify and react to gaps in government capacity to respond? 2) How do non-state entities work to coordinate their efforts with those of government, and why do these efforts prove effective or ineffective? We address these questions by conducting three waves of semi- structured, elite interviews in affected areas of both Texas and Florida. Grounded in established political science methods and approaches, our analysis will rely on the coding and computational examination of interview data and the mapping of coordination patterns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia. The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign awards is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on ""OTREC"".<br/><br/>Tropical convection plays a critical role in earth's climate system and is also responsible for extreme precipitation and hurricane formation.  Easterly waves are of particular interest for weather forecasting given their tendency to spawn hurricanes.  More generally, tropical convection is an engine of weather and climate worldwide yet poorly understood and difficult to simulate.  Work leading to better representation of tropical convection in weather and climate models can thus lead to better weather forecasts and impact assessments, both for the public and decision makers.  Aside from the societal relevance of the science, the campaign features several education and outreach activities.  These including support for undergraduate participation and production of short documentary videos for use in classroom teaching and informal science education. In addition, the PI performs science outreach through the Expanding Your Horizons program, which conducts a one-day conference for about 300 middle school girls, giving them the opportunity to explore careers that use math and science.  The project also provides support and training for two graduate students, thereby providing for the future workforce in this research area.<br/><br/>The eight week OTREC deployment consists primarily of a set of 20 flights in the Gulfstream V research aircraft maintained by the National Center for Atmospheric Research.  The campaign uses an airport in Costa Rica for easy access to the equatorial Pacific and southwest Caribbean study regions, and conditions in these regions are sampled using dropsondes and a wing-mounted W-band radar.  Dropsondes contain the same instrument package as standard weather balloons, only dropped from an aircraft (in this case from about 40,000 feet) with a small parachute.  The radar determines cloud properties such as the relative abundance of ice particles versus liquid droplets, and uses Doppler shift to measure updraft and downdraft speeds in clouds.  The aircraft sampling is augmented by observations collected at ground sites in Costa Rica and Colombia.<br/><br/>Despite intensive study we still lack a satisfactory theory for how environmental conditions determine when and where tropical convection will form, how long it will last, how much it will expand and organize, and how much rain it will produce.  Over the eastern Pacific tropical convection occurs in a narrow east-west strip a few degrees north of the equator, in a region where near-surface winds come together in an intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ).  There are convincing arguments that rising motions associated with heavy rainfall in the ITCZ should have a bottom-heavy vertical profile, meaning that the bulk of the rising motion in clouds occurs in the lower and middle troposphere.  But the idea of a bottom-heavy profile is contradicted by satellite observations (from the NASA TRMM mission) which appear to show a large fraction of stratiform precipitation.  Such precipitation typically falls from upper-level clouds in regions of widespread convection characterized by a top-heavy profile of rising motion.  In this project OTREC campaign data is used to resolve the vertical profile contradiction and test an alternative interpretation of the satellite data.<br/><br/>A further issue is the extent to which convection in the ITCZ is driven by the near-surface wind convergence in the region.  Some argue (see for example AGS-1758603) that convection in the eastern Pacific ITCZ is largely due to thermodynamic factors associated with stability and energy balance, with near-surface convergence playing a secondary role. Here the PI hypothesizes that the thermodynamic arguments are not sufficient and the wind convergence plays a dominant role.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, languages aren't merely passive vehicles for the transmission of information. Rather, our sentences carry along with them evidence of the fundamental concepts and categories that we use to understand the world and each other. At one level, this fact about language might seem obvious: a person on one side of an argument might choose to use words that a person on a different side might not, and attending to these different choices tells us something about the people speaking. Such observations about language and language users are studied in fields like sociolinguistics. Yet, our language also reveals more basic truths about us which are not as easily accessible to consciousness, and which are more tied to elements of our common experience. For example, people talk as if there are objects that can be counted (""four spoons"") and substances that cannot (e.g., ""four muds"" is odd), even if arranged in discrete piles. Investigating language at this deeper level can thus reveal basic structures of thought, informing theories of cognition and its development, as well as applications in artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>This project studies parallels in the conceptualization of the basic categories 'object' and 'event' as they are encoded in language and understood by both adults and 4 year olds. Previous research in linguistics and the philosophy of language has uncovered striking formal parallels in the encoding of these categories across nominal and verbal language. The project links this research to what is known about object representation in cognitive science, and uses this link to extend what is known about event representation. Specifically, the project (i) tests whether the observed linguistic parallels correspond to parallels in how adults and children conceptualize minimally-different static and dynamic scenes, (ii) investigates the extent to which representational biases for simple dynamic scenes predicts how adults and children understand quantificational language involving words like ""more"", and (iii) probes the hypothetical universality of the language-cognition linkages by teaching English-speaking adults and children attested, but non-English patterns of event encoding. The results of this project will demonstrate the fruitfulness of connecting formal semantics, philosophy of language, and cognitive science to illuminate the interface between linguistic and non-linguistic perception and cognition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum machines may soon be capable of performing calculations in machine learning, computer security, chemistry, and other fields that are extremely difficult or even impossible for today's computers. Few of these limitless possibilities on the horizon that quantum computing could lead to are better drug discovery, more efficient photovoltaics, new nanoscale materials, and perhaps even more efficient food production. These benefits will be enabled by substantially improving the ability to solve computational problems in quantum chemistry, quantum simulation, and optimization. These dramatic improvements arise because each additional quantum bit doubles the potential computing power of a machine, accumulating exponential gains that could eventually eclipse the world's largest supercomputers. Quantum computing will also drive a new segment of the computing industry, providing new strategies for specific applications that increase computational power even as physical limits slow improvements in classical silicon-chip technology. This multi-institutional project, Enabling Practical-scale Quantum Computing (EPiQC) Expedition, will help bring the great potential of this new paradigm into reality by reducing the current gap between existing theoretical algorithms and practical quantum computing architectures. Over five years, the EPiQC Expedition will collectively develop new algorithms, software, and machine designs tailored to key properties of quantum device technologies with 100 to 1000 quantum bits. This work will facilitate profound new scientific discoveries and also broadly impact the state of high-performance computing. To prepare the U.S. workforce for this revolution in computing, we need to educate citizens to think about computing from a quantum perspective, integrating concepts such as probability and uncertainty into the digital lexicon. The EPiQC Expedition will design teaching curricula and distribute exemplar materials for students ranging from primary school to engineers in industry. EPiQC will also establish an academic-industry consortium which will share educational and research products and accelerate the pace of quantum computing design and applications.  <br/><br/>Because quantum computing is a new branch of computer science, it will require entirely new types of algorithms and software. In order to produce practical quantum computation in the near future, these elements cannot be developed in isolation. Instead, researchers must increase the efficiency of quantum algorithms running on quantum machines through the simultaneous design and optimization of algorithms, software and machines. New algorithms and software need to know what specific machine operations are easy or difficult in a given quantum technology and must be prepared to produce useful answers from imperfect results from imperfect machines. Software also needs to verify that the computation executed correctly as expected, an especially difficult task given that conventional machines cannot simulate even a modest-size quantum machine. The EPiQC Expedition unites experts on algorithms, software, architecture, and education to develop these elements in parallel. Overall, EPiQC will increase the efficiency of practical quantum computations by 100 to 1000 times, effectively bringing quantum computing out of the laboratory and into practical use 10-20 years sooner than through technology advances alone. The project identifies 4 thrusts: algorithmic innovations, compiler development, verification, and the broader impact tasks of developing education modules. The algorithmic tasks are organized into the subdomains of optimization, computational chemistry, and the discovery of separations between quantum and classical speedup. The compiler tasks are more milestone driven - development of technology libraries, development of various compilation techniques which leverages these libraries, as well as novel error correction schemes. The project will tie the tool chain closely to the underlying hardware and fault-tolerance mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such willingness may translate into immediate desire to help (e.g., donate money) as well as the long-term propensity to support policies contributing to disaster mitigation and adaptation (at a possible cost to tax-payers). Willingness to help, however, may be a product of complex interaction between individual socioeconomic status, demographic characteristics, psychological attributes, political ideology, and beliefs about the issue of climate change. Moreover, the rally effect may be short-term for some but long-term for others. Understanding the complexity of this relationship may increase efficiency of social mobilization to help victims of natural disasters and contribute to greater environmental awareness and support for natural disaster preparedness in general. The investigator proposes to conduct a two-wave survey of public opinion on a nationally representative sample of adults in the United States. The goal of the survey is to examine respondents' reactions to hurricanes (specifically, Hurricane Harvey) and analyze how individual attitudes and willingness to help change over time.<br/><br/>Previously, scholars suggested investigating the time course of reactions to natural disasters but the temporal dimension of public opinion in the context of hurricanes and other such disasters remains largely unexplored. The proposed survey design examines possible deterioration of empathetic concern for victims of the disaster in the context of individual ideological preferences (e.g., liberal or conservative), partisan/political identification, psychological traits (e.g., perspective taking, social desirability bias), behavioral propensities (e.g., risk preferences, future discounting), and social environment (e.g., existence of tangible social support). An important goal of the project is to establish under which conditions helping behavior is most stable and under which it is most fragile and short-lived. Previous research has shown that willingness to help increases if responsibility for disasters could be attributed to human actions (e.g., government), not natural phenomena (which traditionally included hurricanes). Therefore, greater attribution of hurricanes to anthropogenic climate change has a potential to promote helping behavior and environmental support in general.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is however challenging to maintain the optimal condition given various uncertainties involved in these systems. Advances in computing and sensing technologies can potentially enable a paradigm shift in the management of infrastructure systems by realistically capturing the uncertainties involved. The main challenge is still the high computational cost that would entail, mainly due to large size of infrastructure networks. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) award aims to enable the next generation of fast uncertainty quantification (UQ) methodologies that can significantly reduce simulation time and are particularly tailored for large infrastructure networks. This award will analyze the case of interdependent transportation-energy systems that involves the integration of electric vehicles. The project will also establish an integrated education and outreach plan to prepare the next generation of civil engineers with improved programming and computational skills. This is done through development of a new graduate-level course, mentoring of undergraduate researchers, partnership with educational physiologists to enhance educational plans, and also outreach to the broader civil engineering student population, K-12 students, and decision makers. The new methods will promote progress of science in UQ and infrastructure modeling, and together with the educational and outreach activities can collectively lead to improved infrastructure operations and promote the economic competitiveness of our society. <br/><br/>This project will use stochastic simulations to realistically capture the complexities. The approaches will build upon and enrich current UQ machinery. These advanced UQ methods will aim to (1) intelligently identify the redundancies in the flow models of infrastructure systems, (2) use topology characteristics of these networks towards model reduction, (3) build an effective online training framework that use streaming sensor data, and (4) take advantage of the availability of flow models at various fidelity levels to produce multifidelity predictions. Specifically, the approaches include advanced compressive sampling methods in polynomial chaos expansion for effective removal of uncertainties related to network redundancies; a topology-based dimension reduction algorithm integrated with compressive sampling approach to exploit the topology information of infrastructure networks; a block-wise recursive least square approach to enable an effective online learning for polynomial surrogates with quantified modeling errors; and a multifidelity regression framework for building surrogates using results of simulations at various fidelity levels. If successful, these advances will collectively contribute to the transformation of infrastructure engineering where simulation-based data-intensive design suites that can assist decision makers will be increasingly used.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this multidisciplinary project, the investigators want to understand what triggered the recent extinction of all of Madagascar's large native vertebrates, including its chimpanzee- and gorilla-sized lemurs, enormous 'elephant birds,' and horned crocodiles. The discovery of extraordinary deposits of fossils and stalagmites in previously-unexplored flooded and dry caves at Tsimanampesotse National Park (TNP) in southwestern Madagascar has opened new opportunities for researchers to address this question. An international team of anthropologists, geologists and ecologists will work with cave divers to retrieve and study fossils and stalagmites from the flooded caves and nearby dry deposits. By taking small samples of rock from stalagmites and studying their chemistry, the team will be able to reconstruct with great precision changes in habitat and rainfall over the past 50,000 years. Team members will also document changes in the presence or absence of small animals that may be excellent indicators of habitat transformation. Through this work, they will identify specific turning points in the catastrophic decline and extinction of Madagascar's large vertebrates, which will have broad implications for how to avoid future extinctions on the island and elsewhere. The team will support public science outreach with creation of 3D maps of the flooded caves and fossil deposits, and multi-language, multi-media educational displays. The displays will focus on conservation, and how understanding the past can inform the future. Finally, this project will support the doctoral dissertations of three graduate students, and build future opportunities for international collaborative research.    <br/><br/>The investigators will utilize state-of-the-art techniques from anthropology, ecology, cave science and paleoclimatology to tease apart how environmental changes and human activities affect communities of plants and animals. This work is challenging, especially since natural aridification (through reduced rainfall) and human disturbance (through setting fires, cutting trees, raising cattle or other introduced domesticated animals, and planting crops) can have similar devastating effects on the distribution and abundance of wild plants and animals. However, stalagmites preserve precisely-datable records of changes in local rainfall and vegetation. Consequently, it is possible to know when rainfall and vegetation co-varied, and when vegetation changed independent of rainfall, implying that some other agent, such as humans, was responsible. Bones and teeth of animals can preserve datable evidence of the diets, activities, movements and habitats of species that have survived, and those that have not. Sometimes traces on the surfaces of fossils themselves preserve evidence of how individuals died - for example, by succumbing to a predatory bird, carnivore or human. This project will tease apart the relative importance of environmental change and human activities, and build a chronology of the survival and extinction of species. Advances in the science of the chemistry of rocks, bones, and teeth, coupled with the old-fashioned tools of paleontological analysis (identifying fossils and recording their associations) have made all of this possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation project will investigate how differences in early exposure to multiple caregivers influence a human infant's early communicative and cognitive development. The researchers hypothesize that AMC plays a significant role in shaping communicative and cognitive development by providing a rich and varied learning environment. Identifying how exposure to AMC may influence cognitive and communicative developmental trajectories will advance our understanding of why extensive AMC developed and was maintained in the human species. This project will support training and mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students in STEM research, and a new partnership between the University of Arizona's School of Anthropology and the Frances McClelland Institute for Children, Youth, and Families. The outcomes of this research may also inform educational programs to support communicative and cognitive development. To share their findings with the public, the researchers will generate a website and visit local mothers' support groups.<br/><br/>AMC is known to supplement an infant's intense energy needs through nutritional provisioning, but previous research has not fully investigated whether allomaternal care benefits infants in other ways. This research enhances traditional perceptions of AMC by hypothesizing that children gain important communicative and cognitive benefits in addition to nutritional support when they receive frequent allomaternal care during early development. The research represents an interdisciplinary, holistic approach to exploring the potential effects of AMC on early brain development before the age of two. Using a novel combination of interdisciplinary methods, including questionnaires, daily diaries, interviews, laboratory tasks, and clinical cognitive measures, this project will examine how care impacts developmental outcomes in young children. Participants will include infants aged 13 to 18 months and their mothers. The primary objective of this study is to determine whether AMC improves early developmental outcomes, such that infants exposed to high levels of AMC develop a more extensive set of communicative and cognitive skills at a younger age than infants exposed to low levels of AMC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The cells and tissues that make up living organisms have material properties just like any other substance. When exposed to mechanical forces, such as pulling or pushing, they stretch and change shape. They can even generate these forces themselves.  The material properties of cells are controlled by the cytoskeleton, a collection of filamentous proteins. This network of filaments gives cells their shape, much like the skeleton defines the human shape. In cells, however, this network is dynamic and adaptive, reorganizing itself to help cells perform various functions or to resist outside mechanical stresses. The cytoskeleton thus represents a new class of material that doesn't obey the traditional models of engineering materials. It can modulate its material properties in both space and time.  This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project will determine how the cell is able to spatially and temporally regulate its material properties and unearth novel design principles that can be used to develop new engineering materials and to understand how some diseases affect cell behavior. Sitting at the interface between physics, biology, and engineering, this multi-disciplinary work will inform research across a broad spectrum of fields. Most importantly, it will create opportunities for a diverse set of students and young researchers to develop innovative skills and perspectives, in particular learning to communicate novel methods and ideas across disciplines. <br/><br/>The cytoskeleton is a model system for developing insights into non-equilibrium mechanics and network dynamics, and is known to both generate and respond to mechanical signals. Despite the fact that the principal molecular biochemical interactions have been well detailed, we still lack an understanding of how macroscopic scale behaviors emerge from the collection of many molecular interactions. Septins are the least studied filaments that make up the cytoskeleton. They bind to both actin and the plasma membrane, and have been shown to localize specifically to regions of actin curvature and mechanical stress. This research project will test the hypothesis that septins help to regulate the material properties of the cytoskeleton by altering the local architecture. This work will measure the material properties of septin-actin networks in both living cells and purified protein networks, and test the response of these networks to mechanical perturbations such as micropatterning to control cell shape, traction force microscopy, and optogenetics to induce local contractions. In addition to potentially uncovering novel mechanisms to regulate cell shape, this work will also generate insight into how molecular interactions in a network are integrated into macroscopic behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With a controlled time release of the oxidant payload, the CRPs technology treats contaminated water over longer periods eliminating the occurrence of contaminant rebound resulting in overall shorter cleanup time and total cost. ISCO is the fastest growing field among sub surface contaminant remediation technologies. Current commercial ISCO deployment methods utilize liquid oxidants as reagents which possess short term reactivity (days). To address contaminant rebounding, these injectable formulations require costly re-injections. This project would result in a novel product that is environmentally  benign  and  achieves sustained release  of  oxidative  agents  over extended  treatment  periods  (months  to years)  with  a  single application.

To support field testing, a pilot scale manufacturing process for the initial minimum viable product established in Phase I will be developed. Manufacturability will be tested in terms of product quality and stability, throughput, and cost. CRPs formulations based on multiple oxidants, will be manufactured to address a broad range of environmental contaminants including chlorinated solvents, BTEX (benzene/toluene/ethylbenzene/xylene), PAH (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), MTBE (methyl tert-butyl ether), and petroleum hydrocarbons. CRPs will be pilot tested at two field sites with impacted soil and groundwater. The rate and duration of oxidant delivery and contaminant degradation will be measured. In particular, pilot field testing will assess the ability of CRPs to eliminate rebounding. Field data and computation modeling will be used to create a remediation design tool to prescribe future CRP dosing deployment strategies. Collectively, this Phase II program will result in a clear understanding of in-field performance of the CRPs technology to guide future full scale deployment and market uptake.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When paired with sensory functions, autonomous machines with even rudimentary intelligence are expected to revolutionize the world's economy. Today, the vision that most machines have is based on traditional intensity pictures of a scene, just as humans use. This vision modality has many limitations: it is impaired by fog and rain, and it offers no spectral information other than combinations of three fundamental colors. These issues greatly limit the practical use of autonomous machines due to their stringent safety and reliability requirements. As a result, expensive optical instruments are being used to assist conventional vision in accomplishing special tasks. The proposed project has the potential to overcome the fundamental issues of traditional imaging technologies. It is based on a new type of light-sensing pixels that can measure multimodal information of light, such as incident angle, wavelength, and phase. They could offer unprecedented scene awareness for pervasive use in future machines.<br/>Light-sensitive pixels used in today's camera can only detect the intensity of light. The intensity information is sufficient for conventional applications such as photography, its limitations become apparent in advanced vision tasks. This project will develop a new class of photodetectors to measure multimodal information of light waves. They are compact and can form high density arrays as imaging chips. Although multimodal information can be measured through conventional optical components, such as lenses, prisms, and gratings, these components are expensive to integrate. They also degrade spatial resolution and decrease operational speed. This project uses novel nanostructures to exploit unique optical interactions. Multi-modal pixels will be designed using full wave simulation and fabricated with photo-lithography. The multimodal pixels are completely compatible with existing semiconductor fabrication facilities and could potentially be mass-produced at the cost of consumer electronics. The project will also develop new machine learning algorithms to exploit multimodal information to perform vision tasks far beyond those possible with today's intensity-only approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies using historical records suggest a similar 'cost of reproduction' in human females, but are often confounded by unmeasured social and environmental factors that obscure causal relationships between reproduction and lifespan. This doctoral dissertation project will use a new measure of 'epigenetic age' to better understand these life history trade-offs in humans. By examining both reproduction and epigenetic age at several time points in a woman's life, social and environmental effects on aging can be accounted for, yielding a clearer picture of the costs of reproduction. Uncovering the molecular pathways responsible for costs of reproduction in women could inform new strategies for diagnosing and treating age-related diseases. This project will also support graduate student training and long-term research collaborations.<br/><br/>The investigators will analyze data for 195 women who are part of the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey to test whether those who have had more pregnancies show signs of more rapid biological aging during a 13-year period. The number of children, their sex, size, and birth spacing - as well as energy allocated to breastfeeding - will be calculated over the women's peak reproductive lives, and compared to the pace change in each woman's epigenetic age. Epigenetic age is calculated by counting chemical modifications made to DNA, and is a strong predictor of negative health outcomes and mortality across multiple populations. The researchers will also examine the relationship between reproduction and epigenetic age among 155 older women, for whom they will combine these data with a separate, comprehensive survey of age-related decline. This will be the first study to examine the effect of reproduction on epigenetic age in females, and will provide an important foundation for future studies aimed at clarifying the links between reproduction and late life outcomes in humans.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Worked bone tools are considered among the important features characterizing modern human behavior. In Europe complex bone technologies are characteristics of the Upper Paleolithic which began about 40,000 years ago. Bone tools were made with techniques specifically adapted to bone materials such as scraping, grinding and polishing and a wide range of shapes and functions (split-base points, bone handles, spear-throwers, points, harpoons).  The bone technology of earlier ""pre-modern"" humans is said to be simpler and involving a lower degree of conceptualization than Upper Paleolithic tools. Limb bones used as hammers and scrapers for the manufacture of stone tools are known from European sites as old as 500, 000 years ago. Just a few pieces show evidence of shaping by flaking and fully shaped tools are even rarer. The goal of this research is to understand in greater detail the processes by which they were made. This research will not only further basic knowledge regarding the human past but also further international scientific collaboration. The research involves close collaboration by members of an international team.<br/><br/>Multiple tools made by flaking elephant long bones of symmetrical shape have been described in four sites in Latium (Italy) dated between 400,000 and 300,000 years ago. The manufacturing technique used was the same technique used in knapping stone artifacts. This transfer of techniques from stones to bone is taken as an indication that pre-modern humans were incapable of creative thinking. An important aspect of early bone technology is about the criteria used to correctly identify tools since various natural processes can produce mimics of man-made tools. This project will carry out a technological and taphonomic analysis of all the bone and stone tools from the assemblage of Castel di Guido dated to about 400,000 years ago. Many pieces classed as tools present only a limited amount of modification that is not distinctive enough to remove doubts about their intentionality. Analysis will be directed to the elimination of ambiguities in the identification of flaked bone artifacts by using features characteristic of stone artifacts. The fact that recent advances in dating suggest that the four sites in Latium are closer in time than expected invite a question: do these occurrences of flaked bone artifacts so common in the Latium region represent a genuine regional tradition, reflecting a set of socially transmitted habits between groups in the same region? This would run counter to the conventional idea that pre-modern culture was static and homogeneous over its large geographic extent and long periods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, they will be  of interest to  researchers and stakeholders beyond the academy, including NGOs, not-for-profit agencies, and funding institutions. <br/><br/>Making qualitative data publically available has become salient at a time when there are increasing calls for transparency in the conduct of social research. Responding to this call may be most readily accomplished by researchers whose large quantitative data sets can be anonymized and when consent appears to be either straightforward, or these data are already in the public domain. This workshop will focus on the ethical challenges of archiving qualitative inquiry and the transferability of quantitative data archiving, sharing, and reuse. A multidisciplinary group of workshop participants who are sensitive to ethical concerns of informed consent and preserving confidentiality, as well as on the epistemic assumptions that underlie interpretive research methods will develop draft guidelines for making qualitative data public. Once the guidelines are finalized they will be disseminated to members of academic and research communities, organizations, funders, and journal editors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Memorialization in the United States has been a growing trend over the past few decades. To date, there has been limited research on how memorials affect relationships between groups and how they affect the attitudes and behaviors of individuals. This project explores how the representation of past violence is interpreted and responded to by those who regularly interact with it. Nationally, the results will provide the opportunity to determine the role and use of memorialization in promoting positive intergroup relations. The project advances the nation's prosperity and welfare by helping us to understand better how the practice of memorialization mediates how our nation grapples with the darkest moments of its past. <br/><br/>A two-wave longitudinal survey of the local city's residents will be used around the opening of a new memorial to capture a pre- and post- measure of social and political attitudes. The survey will be used to: (1) assess how the memorial affects the community and individuals socially, emotionally, and politically; (2) explore how the memorial's representation affects attitudes toward intergroup relations; (3) reveal how that individuals' social positions (i.e., race, class, gender, etc.) influence how they interpret and interact with the memorial; and, (4) explicitly measure social and geo-spatial effects of a physical representation of violence. Whether the results demonstrate a net positive or a net negative effect of the memorial, the research will highlight the impact on present identity representations and intergroup relations. Findings also will be useful to those involved in the opening and managing of such memorials, and those considering their construction.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To accomplish any meaningful grid-wide optimization task, the distribution system operator will need to precisely know the power consumed or generated at every node, the line and transformer parameters, and the topology of the grid. However currently, limited instrumentation and their sheer size render power distribution grids unobservable in general. To complement the smart metering and grid sensing infrastructure, the novel technique of grid probing is introduced here. Grid probing can be accomplished by commanding smart inverters residing at a subset of nodes to intentionally yet instantaneously perturb their power injections. Actuating the networked physical system and subsequently sensing the incurred voltages at metered nodes can unveil non-metered loads and network topologies. The original and potentially transformative idea of engaging smart inverters outside their intended control functionality pioneers new grid data analytics. This program goes beyond probing and maps the observability limits by processing smart meter data too. Contemporary optimization schemes together with their real-time and decentralized variants will deal with streaming and spatially incomplete voltage and power injection data collected at large-scale unbalanced distribution networks.<br/><br/>On the broader impact, this program lies at the nexus of power systems, nonlinear system identification, and statistical learning; advances our understanding of unique patterns in grid data; and discovers novel uses for inverters in grid monitoring and control. Enhancing situational awareness in distribution grids benefits society by enabling the efficient and reliable integration of distributed renewable energy, electric vehicles, and customer participation. The expected benefits to industry are cutting-edge grid analytics solutions, advanced asset management, and value added for inverters and smart meters. The proposed activities bring about a potentially transformative paradigm for grid data processing, neatly integrated with educational and outreach objectives. The program reaches pre-college female students through hands-on learning activities and collaborative app-based games on electric grids. It also involves undergraduate research and continues our outreach to undergraduate students through visits to residential communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, BCI technology is a powerful control option for neuro-prosthetic limbs, as well as a potential communication option for people with severe motor disabilities or disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, cerebral palsy, and spinal cord injury, who may have little or even no muscle control and therefore no means of communication with the external world.  The International Brain-Computer Interface (IBCI) meeting is the flagship conference for the field, the seventh of which will be held May 21-25, 2018, on the Asilomar Conference Grounds in Pacific Grove,, California.  Effective BCI research requires interdisciplinary interactions involving neuroscience, psychology, engineering, mathematics, computer science, and clinical rehabilitation, and the IBCI meeting serves as a critical catalyst for technology dissemination, new collaborations, and educational opportunities for students.  The primary source of funding for the meeting is the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  This NSF funding will enable another 22 students, including undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, to attend and participate in the conference.  The organizers are planning innovations to make the 2018 event the most valuable yet.  For the first time the conference will include a series of 12 one-hour masterclasses, six of which will meet in parallel on Wednesday evening, and the other six will meet in parallel on Thursday afternoon.  Each masterclass will have a senior researcher as the ""master"" along with two students each of whom will present his/her research for 10-15 minutes, after which the master will provide wise and constructive comments, with audience participation encouraged in an informal session intended to give students access to senior expertise and to get good tips for their research.  Another new event at this year's meeting with be the ""BCI Hackathon"" organized and sponsored by G.Tec Medical Engineering GmbH, during which participants will work in teams on a number of BCI applications and will then present their work to the hackathon community.  NSF funding will be used to support student travel, registration, and student-only event costs.  Student participation in previous IBCI meetings has been very fruitful; a large number of those students have now graduated and are prominent researchers in the BCI field.  The organizers are actively recruiting student attendees from traditionally underrepresented groups.  More information about the conference may be found online at http://bcisociety.org/meetings/bci-2018-welcome/.  <br/><br/>Because of the growth in the field of BCI research, 300 or more participants are expected to attend this meeting, including investigators from at least 100 BCI research groups. All attendees commit to the entire meeting, from the opening reception and dinner on the evening of Monday, May 21 through the final summary discussion at breakfast the morning of Friday, May 25.  A main objective of the conference is to give students a significant educational and professional experience in the BCI field, and to provide opportunities for them to gain depth in their specific interest areas. The conference will begin with a specialized student colloquium on the afternoon before the full conference starts, which will provide lectures from prominent experts in the BCI field. This will give the students a solid foundation for understanding the rest of the conference.  There will also be a student poster session and prizes for the best student research projects, as well as giving students access to research leaders for informal question-and-answer sessions at the end of each day. The students will participate fully in the main conference as well.  Exposure to prominent researchers in the BCI field will allow students to receive invaluable feedback on their work, and to make connections that may result in new research directions; it will also provide students with access to potential mentors, committee members, and experts to review their future work.  A full and detailed schedule of planned conference sessions and events, along with any updates, can be found on the conference website.  With all participants housed on site and all meals for all attendees taken together on site, there will be ample opportunity for informal discussions. This creates a unique opportunity for students and trainees to mingle with and learn from established researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It benefits from two previously successful Noyce Scholars' projects awarded to the University of Rochester, and involvement of a newly formed Consortium of involving the university and several school districts in upstate New York working together toward district-wide digital conversion.  Digital conversion includes providing each student with a tablet or laptop computer and using these computers to access digital curriculum resources that can enhance student learning.  This project's goals are to: 1) continue to increase the number of highly-qualified mathematics and science secondary teachers serving students in high-need school districts; 2) engage these Noyce Scholars in the effective use of technology in the classroom; 3) create a state-wide network of Noyce Scholars for support and sharing of resources; and 4) to better understand what it takes to prepare future teachers most effectively.  Achieving the fourth goal has the potential to affect STEM teacher preparation programs nationwide.  The teacher certification program for post-baccalaureate students involves 15 courses, including a teaching practicum, four courses specific to teaching science and mathematics, three courses that integrate digitally-rich technology in teaching and learning in mathematics and science, and five courses focused on teaching students from diverse backgrounds and differentiated needs, including students with disabilities and English Language Learners.<br/><br/>This project is directed by the University of Rochester (through its Warner School of Education and STEM departments), in partnership with East High School (a ""district within a district"" within the Rochester City School District, under New York City Educational Partnership Organization legislation), and East Irondequoit Central School District (a high-need suburban district that is a local pioneer in digital conversion).  It will prepare 26 mathematics and science teachers, who are post-baccalaureate (either recent graduates or career changers) STEM majors (geoscience, computer science, biology, physics, engineering, chemistry, or mathematics), for teaching in high-need schools.  In addition to obtaining teacher certification, these Noyce Scholars will also receive an Advanced Certificate in Digitally-Rich Teaching in K-12 Schools approved by the New York State Education Department.  A critical aspect of the project evaluation seeks to identify common challenges that novice, reform-minded STEM teachers encounter and ways to support them in constructively addressing these challenges.  Findings from this evaluative study have the potential to inform teacher education programs and practices nationwide.  This project intends to advance, apply, and disseminate knowledge about innovative strategies for the recruitment, preparation, induction, and retention of highly-qualified STEM teachers for high-need schools, with a focus on digital transformation efforts to increase student learning and engagement.  As more districts throughout the country move toward digital conversion, a clear need exists to prepare teachers who can thoughtfully integrate technology in the classroom to promote learning and student engagement, particularly in ways that can make mathematics and science more interesting and accessible.  This project is poised to contribute evidence about preparing teachers to incorporate high-quality, digitally-based curriculum and instruction in high-need schools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

On January 9, 2018, three large debris flows in the village of Montecito, Santa Barbara County, California, killed 21 people, destroyed or damaged over 390 homes and commercial buildings, and closed all local traffic for several weeks. The flows were caused by intense precipitation in the days following the Thomas Fire, the largest wildfire in California history. Research suggests the debris flow hazards posed by the Thomas fire may continue for 2 or more years in the wider area affected by the fire. The impact of the debris flows on the Montecito community was increased because both the public and local hazard management officials lacked a clear understanding of the physics of debris flows and the conditions that lead to them. Direct interactions with the public through library Town Hall meetings and articles in the local newspapers should help to educate residents as to the regional geologic setting, the use and understanding of specific terminology (""debris flow"" instead of the more benign-sounding ""flash flood"" or ""mudslide""), and to instill a realistic understanding of the danger of these rapidly moving boulder-laden slurries and the need for self-preservation through immediate attention to emergency management instructions. It should also refine those instructions to be unequivocal mandatory evacuation warnings rather than non-mandatory suggestions.<br/><br/>Current understanding of the physics of natural debris flows and flow-surface profiles is largely based on interpretation of remnant debris flow deposits.  However, understanding the physics of any single debris flow requires the collection of important flow data that are often erased from the geologic record within months to several years. Morell, Dunne and Keller will constrain critical aspects of physical debris flow processes associated with the Jan 9, 2018 Montecito event by collecting time-sensitive field data as to the height and flow direction of the peak flow, the volume of eroded and deposited source material, and the sedimentary character of debris flow deposits, key data needed to understand the source regions, peak velocity, rheology, and the runout, bulking, and scouring of large debris flows. By constructing detailed maps and cross-sections of the debris flow deposits along the three affected drainages, the project will delineate the extent and nature of the event deposit, the surface flow physics that caused the debris flow and the widespread destruction, in preparation for potential near-future events from this same area. It will assess the power of the debris flows to move boulders and attempt to determine scenarios for future flows and warning systems.  The project leverages bare-earth LiDAR data (supplied by the county of Santa Barbara) for use as base maps for field work, and aerial photos flown several days after the debris flows (supplied by the company Geomni).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The target market for this technology is tall buildings in urban areas, where electricity demand is the highest and the available space for installing solar cells is smallest. This technology utilizes a window tint that can absorb sunlight and remit light of a certain color through the window's glass to small solar cells located at the edges. This technology hasn't been commercialized previously because most tint materials typically absorb their own emitted light, limiting efficiency. This project will provide a novel solution to these problems with a low-cost window tint material made from quantum dots. The work conducted in this project focuses on scaling up prototypes and optimization for cost and reliability. With this technology, tall buildings will approach net-zero energy consumption or even supply electricity to the grid. This would reduce the city's carbon footprint as well as save money for the companies/individuals occupying these buildings, which would increase their prosperity and welfare. This technology would also reduce pollution by limiting the amount of burned fossil fuels needed to generate electricity. <br/><br/>The proposed project develops and scales up the electricity-generating window prototypes to the square meter size, validates long-term reliability, optimizes for manufacturing, and launches pilot projects. The technology is based on luminescent solar concentrators, which are made by tinting a window with a fluorophore material that partially absorbs sunlight and then converts it to fluorescence, preferably in the near-infrared. The fluorescence is trapped inside the window by total internal reflection and is concentrated to the edges where small solar cells efficiently convert that light into electricity. Utilizing this technology in windows to generate electricity has not been commercialized due to unsuitable fluorophores. The fluorophore used in this project are quantum dots composed of CuInSeS/ZnS, which solves the problems of previous materials. Traditional fluorophores like dyes typically have strong self-absorption, narrow spectral absorption, and poor stability. Quantum dots are more stable, but are expensive, sometimes toxic (due to heavy metals), and also suffer from self-absorption. The breakthrough in CuInSeS/ZnS quantum dots is that they are significantly cheaper, avoid toxic elements, have near-infrared fluorescence optimal for low-cost commercial solar cells, and do not self-absorb. At the conclusion of the phase II project, prototype products will be installed in at least one building. <br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this multidisciplinary project, the investigators want to understand what triggered the recent extinction of all of Madagascar's large native vertebrates, including its chimpanzee- and gorilla-sized lemurs, enormous 'elephant birds,' and horned crocodiles. The discovery of extraordinary deposits of fossils and stalagmites in previously-unexplored flooded and dry caves at Tsimanampesotse National Park (TNP) in southwestern Madagascar has opened new opportunities for researchers to address this question. An international team of anthropologists, geologists and ecologists will work with cave divers to retrieve and study fossils and stalagmites from the flooded caves and nearby dry deposits. By taking small samples of rock from stalagmites and studying their chemistry, the team will be able to reconstruct with great precision changes in habitat and rainfall over the past 50,000 years. Team members will also document changes in the presence or absence of small animals that may be excellent indicators of habitat transformation. Through this work, they will identify specific turning points in the catastrophic decline and extinction of Madagascar's large vertebrates, which will have broad implications for how to avoid future extinctions on the island and elsewhere. The team will support public science outreach with creation of 3D maps of the flooded caves and fossil deposits, and multi-language, multi-media educational displays. The displays will focus on conservation, and how understanding the past can inform the future. Finally, this project will support the doctoral dissertations of three graduate students, and build future opportunities for international collaborative research.    <br/><br/>The investigators will utilize state-of-the-art techniques from anthropology, ecology, cave science and paleoclimatology to tease apart how environmental changes and human activities affect communities of plants and animals. This work is challenging, especially since natural aridification (through reduced rainfall) and human disturbance (through setting fires, cutting trees, raising cattle or other introduced domesticated animals, and planting crops) can have similar devastating effects on the distribution and abundance of wild plants and animals. However, stalagmites preserve precisely-datable records of changes in local rainfall and vegetation. Consequently, it is possible to know when rainfall and vegetation co-varied, and when vegetation changed independent of rainfall, implying that some other agent, such as humans, was responsible. Bones and teeth of animals can preserve datable evidence of the diets, activities, movements and habitats of species that have survived, and those that have not. Sometimes traces on the surfaces of fossils themselves preserve evidence of how individuals died - for example, by succumbing to a predatory bird, carnivore or human. This project will tease apart the relative importance of environmental change and human activities, and build a chronology of the survival and extinction of species. Advances in the science of the chemistry of rocks, bones, and teeth, coupled with the old-fashioned tools of paleontological analysis (identifying fossils and recording their associations) have made all of this possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Attempts thus far have not been successful in creating robust bonds due to incongruities of the materials being bonded. The objective of this project is to develop a sophisticated, computer controlled, automated bonding machine that will rapidly and safely impact-bond net-shaped ceramic carbides to tool steel in configurations that were previously not available. An automated bonding machine will allow for a cost-effective way to rapidly produce high quality near-net or net-shaped parts. It is expected that as this simple method is popularized, new opportunities for design configurations will be realized in multiple industries; as single parts can take advantage of the properties multiple material, such as the strength and wear resistance of ceramics, with the properties of another, such as the light weight properties of aluminum. Engineers may incorporate cheaper, lighter, stronger, and multipurpose material parts into new product designs. For instance, many new ceramic and metal bonded parts may be fabricated for the automotive, aerospace, chemical, defense, excavation, and nuclear industries. This project will ultimately result in the creation of U.S. manufacturing, sales, and engineering jobs as the mass production of ceramic and metal bonded parts become commercially available.<br/><br/><br/>The impact-bonding occurs within a bonding machine and uses a portable and very powerful cartridge technology recently developed by the PI, an expert in aluminum/water reactions. The cartridges are initiated in an enclosed chamber with a low voltage, which causes the disassociation of water molecules and rapid oxidization of aluminum that generates very high-pressure hydrogen in a safe and controlled manner and without the use of high voltage, explosives or flammable gun propellants. Key technological subjects of this research include the impact-energy, generated hydrogen propulsion, and the post-bond impact-energy absorption. The goal is a manufacturing process that will produce dissimilar material composite parts with superior joint strength that will survive impact-fatigue-cycles in harsh environments such as mining, demolition, excavation, construction, oil gas drilling, and many more potential industries. Other mechanical methods of joining ceramics and metals, such as brazing and adhesives, have not sustained impact fatigue cycling. The superior products are wear resistant and will benefit several industries to include the cutting tool market, electrical and thermally insulated components, ballistic armor, and others. This project aims to produce pioneering publications on impact bonding ceramics and metals and will also further enhance the knowledge of high-velocity impact bonding systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This question is particularly important for tropical forests because they are home to most of the world's species and are essential for global carbon and nutrient cycles; they help control the atmosphere of the entire planet. In a sense, tropical plants are the ""lungs"" of the planet. Scientists are starting to think that drought is critically important in determining how well tropical forests ""breathe"".  However, the evidence for this is still unclear.  In this project, researchers will test how different tropical plant species respond to an ongoing, multi-year drought in Panama. Undergraduate and graduate students from the U.S. will participate in the project and receive training in how to conduct scientific research. <br/><br/>In the context of a large-scale, long-term competition experiment, the PI will examine the role of a multi-year drought to test two predictions: 1) The strength of plant-plant competition increases with drought and varies with species identity. 2) Plant species that capitalize on drought will share a suite of plant hydraulic functional traits. By testing these predictions, the PI can provide a functional-mechanistic explanation for how different species respond to drought, and determine whether plant-plant competition intensifies the effects of drought. By examining the responses of more than 100 plant species and by relating those responses to a suite of functional characteristics for each species, this project will identify the subset of species that will likely increase or decrease with future droughts, as well as the dual effects of drought and competition on tree species performance. Considering the importance of both drought and competition to tropical forest diversity and function, results will be fundamental to our understanding of tropical forest ecology and, more generally, ecosystem health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This doctoral dissertation project uses a non-human primate model to investigate male and female variation in brain anatomy and gene expression and to consider selective pressures that may have led to this variation. This fundamental research has the potential to inform developing treatments for neurobehavioral disorders in humans, particularly given that the non-human primate model is likely to be more relevant than murine models for understanding social behavior. Funding for this project will support the research of a minority female graduate student who will also serve as an educator and mentor. She will conduct science outreach through her participation in multiple after-school and summer programs, all of which offer mentorship and/or research experience to underrepresented and underserved students interested in science. <br/><br/>Sexual selection is an evolutionary process whereby certain traits are under selective pressure related to competition over access to mates or selection of preferred mates. These mechanisms differ across species, and have resulted in sex differences in non-neurological traits (e.g. body size, hair color). Limited evidence suggests that sexual selection may also influence brain evolution and that these selective pressures may have been particularly strong on the brain during human evolution. The researchers will collect new neurobiological data in female and male primate brains to characterize species-specific sex differences in brain region volumes, sulcal morphology, and gene expression using phylogenetic comparative methods and differential expression analyses. They will then test for correlates of within-species variation in brain sex differences using two large datasets, including chimpanzee sulcal morphology and rhesus macaque brain gene expression, which also contain matching behavioral data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Direct view LED displays, or video walls, are becoming more ubiquitous in everyday life. First only appearing in sports stadiums, they have gradually started appearing in retail advertising, and now are starting to appear in cinemas and control rooms. These types of displays are much brighter, have better contrast ratios, faster refresh rates, and are more energy efficient than other competing display technologies. Despite these advantages, rate of adoption is very slow, limited by the cost and time required to make these displays. Current manufacturing tools are facing a bottleneck as display resolutions increase. A massively parallel assembly technology could drastically increase production speeds while reducing cost-of-goods. Additionally, the knowledge gained by the research into this self-assembly technology has the potential to unlock new opportunities in semiconductor packaging including lighting and concentrated solar.<br/><br/>The proposed project seeks to speed-up the LED placement process by leveraging the parallel nature of directed self-assembly. Rather than placing individual LEDs into a grid-array as it is done today, this technology utilizes confining magnetic fields to quickly and simply arrange hundreds or thousands of LEDs into a neat and ordered grid-array. The objective is to achieve assembly speeds at least 5 times faster than conventional tools. The research will focus on the effects of LED size and geometry on accuracy, rate, and yield. Additionally,  new magnetic field stages to enhance assembly precision will be developed. The key anticipated results are (1) a system that will be able to rapidly assemble thousands of LED die with the precision necessary for high-resolution displays and (2) a fully operational LED display panel constructed with this technology to demonstrate the manufacturing potential of this technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The event will take place in conjunction with (and on the first day of) the Tenth International Conference on the Theory and Application of Diagrams (DIAGRAMS 2018), to be held June 18-22, 2018, at Edinburgh Napier University, UK, and which will be co-located with the 23rd International<br/>Conference on Conceptual Structures.  Diagrams are wide-ranging and open-ended representations that include sketches, drawings, charts, pictures, 2D and 3D geometric models, and maps. They are a vital tool in human communication in areas such as art and science, as well as commerce and industry. A better understanding of how effective diagrams can be generated and used has the potential to produce transformative advances in these areas. DIAGRAMS is the only conference series that provides a forum for all aspects of research on the theory and application of diagrams. It is a bi-annual, international and interdisciplinary event whose goals are to present and discuss (a) state-of-the-art research on computational, cognitive and socio-cultural theories, models and techniques of reasoning with diagrammatic representations, and (b) cutting-edge intelligent and interactive information technologies for using diagrammatic representations in supporting human reasoning. Research topics include understanding diagrammatic reasoning in humans, understanding the use of diagrammatic representation for communication, developing techniques for automated diagrammatic reasoning, and designing tools for use of diagrammatic representations. The conference series is overseen by the DIAGRAMS Steering Committee with a rotating membership; more information is available at the conference website http://www.diagrams-conference.org/2018/.  DIAGRAMS 2018 will significantly increase our understanding of diagrammatic reasoning in humans and machines, and will add momentum to the development of new information technologies for the use of diagrammatic representations in support of human reasoning. The conference will help develop human research capital by enabling interactions between senior and junior researchers and by catalyzing new collaborations. The Doctoral Consortium will increase the exposure and visibility of young graduate student researchers in these areas, and help train them by providing early input from senior researchers in the field in an interactive and constructive environment. The social network among this next generation of researchers, and the relationships with senior researchers, created by the workshop will play a critical role in their enculturation into the profession. Diversity of the selected students is a goal of the organizers, who will be proactive in an effort to ensure that both students and faculty are a diverse group across multiple dimensions including nationality, scientific discipline and gender. To further assure diversity, only one student will be selected from each educational institution, with preference given to students from underrepresented populations.<br/><br/>The primary goal of the DIAGRAMS 2018 Doctoral Consortium is to increase the exposure and visibility of young graduate student researchers in these areas. The workshop will be a research-focused day-long meeting that affords participants an opportunity to present their work and get feedback from established researchers in the field, who will be present to comment on the young researchers' presentations in an informal and constructive environment. Each invited participant will have approximately half an hour for presentation of their research, that may include a short demonstration if appropriate, and which will be followed by discussion and critiquing. For some students, this may be their first opportunity to give a research talk outside their home institutions.  Therefore, each student will be assigned a mentor (selected from the Program Committee), who will preview the student's presentation and offer suggestions for improvement as well as provide sample questions that may arise during the discussion.  The Doctoral Consortium is open for attendance to all conference registrants, and summaries of the student presentations will be available on the conference website.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Annual Meeting of OHBM is regarded as the premier venue for the integration of innovative brain imaging methods and cognitive neuroscience. It was started more than 20 years ago to provide a forum for the brain-mapping scientific community to disseminate findings and enable interactions among scientists investigating the functional organization of the brain with emerging imaging methods. Since 1994, the OHBM has sponsored twenty-three highly successful meetings, where attendees are exposed to cutting-edge neuroimaging data acquisition methods, emerging approaches to large-scale neuroimaging data analysis, the visualization of results, and their applications in health and disease. This award will fund travel awards for deserving students and trainees to attend the 2018 Annual Meeting to be held in Singapore. Travel awards will be given to 30 students with high-ranking abstracts. Of these at least 15 travel awards will be awarded to the students with the top-ranked abstracts among 3 targeted groups (women, minorities, disabled). <br/><br/>The Annual Meeting provides a means for students of neuroimaging to attend educational courses, hear lectures from leading brain researchers, form new collaborations, and to present their original research. OHBM On Demand provides public access to educational resources year-round by publishing online past OHBM courses and talks. These openly available videos and slides include keynote lectures and educational courses on topics covering state-of-the-art methodologies and clinical applications of neuroimaging. Historically, female representation in the mathematical and computational sciences has been low. In contrast, in both neuroscience and psychology it has been relatively high. Hence, the conference's position in the cross-section of statistics, computer-science, psychology, and neuroscience promises to provide computational training to a diverse audience and help bridge the gender gaps in the STEM fields. In addition, improved understanding of the organization of the human brain is directly relevant to treating neurological and psychiatric disease, and the use of non-invasive imaging methods is increasingly important to translational investigation and training in clinical neuroscience. As neuroimaging is used in a wide-range of scientific disciplines, we would expect benefits for society in areas ranging from economic and social policies to medical, educational and psychological interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These issues have only grown more significant and complex because of conflicting understandings about the environmental and heritage value of rural lands as well as increased participation of non-profits and the public in land management practices. This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, asks how land managers balance these myriad priorities to improve processes of public involvement in land management planning. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations invested in discovering more effective means of navigating land management, improving policies and practices, and promoting environmental, cultural, and economic sustainability.<br/><br/>Doctoral student Julia Sizek, supervised by Dr. Daniel Fisher at the University of California-Berkeley, will explore what factors influence shifts in land management policies and practices on rural lands. Research conducted in Southeastern California's Mojave Desert, an area gaining increasing visibility as both a place of ecological value and a site of Native American, homesteading, and military history. This region is currently in the process of land management planning for two new national monuments (Mojave Trails National Monument and Castle Mountains National Monuments, established 2016), but also contains a contentious National Park Service unit: the Mojave National Preserve, established in 1994. By studying how members of environmental and Native American organizations participate in land management planning and understand the value of the desert, this research will reveal the cultural and ecological value of desert lands as understood today, and how this affects land management priorities. This research will also follow land managers on privately and publicly-held conservation lands, seeing how land management practices (e.g.  use regulations, fence-building, trail-building, reseeding, signage) are changing in the desert as understandings of desert ecology and the extent of historical and cultural research are becoming more accurate. Data about understandings of the desert and scientific advances will be collected through interviews with relevant experts, analysis of environmental events aimed at public participation in planning processes, and site visits to areas of ecological restoration and desert protection. The project will advance theoretical debates about land and governance under conditions of environmental uncertainty, and the effects of heterogeneity in land conservation practices. Research results will be relevant to landscape-scale environmental planning processes happening in the Mojave Desert and elsewhere, and will also show how perceptions of the environmental value of the desert are shifting and with what effects for land management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The approach is expected to reduce the design area occupied by conventional capacitors, resulting in chip design-area reduction and improvement in chip performance and efficiency. A Computer Aided Design framework will be developed to optimize the use of these reconfigured TSVs. The resulting devices, circuits, and framework will be validated using silicon tape outs and emerging applications, e.g., advanced wireless broadband communications. In addition to enabling educational and outreach programs, the project provides industrial experience for underrepresented students, thus contributing to the development of workforce in this area of technology.<br/><br/>The project undertakes a systematic attempt to explore the alternative use of TSVs as capacitors in 3D Neuromorphic Computing (NC) circuits. The NC chips require membrane capacitors to power the process of ""neuron firing"", and, depending on specifications, these capacitors can occupy from 25-75% of state-of-the-art electronic neuron's design area. This project entails the design of a NC chip in which idle TSVs are co-opted to function as capacitors. Three specific thrusts are proposed: reconfiguration and adaption of idle TSVs as capacitors; scalable, robust, and energy-efficient 3D NC circuit design; and system prototype and emerging applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fertilizer plant waste carries microorganisms that grow well in high-N conditions; thus, the concurrent addition of N and unique microbes could enhance microbiological N removal activity within the river, and will advance understanding of the connections between microbial community composition and riverine nitrogen cycling. This is a significant frontier in ecosystem science with high potential to improve mechanistic understanding of future changes in ecosystem structure and function. To accomplish these goals, the research uses two approaches. First, the relationship between changes in river water quality and changes in river water microbial communities will be measured over time and compared to unaffected sections of the river. Second, in order to directly test whether different microbial populations have different effects on water quality, lab experiments will compare N removal in waters inoculated with microorganisms from either the river or fertilizer waste ponds. This project focuses on a uniquely well-defined release of water with distinct chemistry and microbial composition, which enables clear tracking of the effect of altered N input and microbial community composition on river water quality. This research will teach us whether knowing water microbial community composition helps predict water quality in a large river. This project supports direct engagement between research scientists and their local municipality and watershed organization to learn about controls on water quality. It also gives graduate and undergraduate students hands-on experience collecting, synthesizing and interpreting data on river chemistry and microbiology.<br/> <br/>To reach project goals, the researchers will deploy a suite of sensors (nitrate and dissolved oxygen) and automated water samplers, and collect grab samples to characterize downstream changes in river biogeochemistry and microbial community composition. Also, the researchers will filter live microbial cells from river and fertilizer waste water and use these cells to inoculate replicated lab incubation chambers that contain different N concentrations. Response variables measured in both field and lab activities include: water chemistry, nitrification and denitrification rate potentials, total bacterial and archaeal community composition, nitrification and denitrification functional gene abundance. This work offers a unique opportunity to better understand how large rivers transport and transform nutrients in the face of altered nutrient inputs and microbial loads, a key gap in our understanding of lotic nutrient cycling. Also, because nitrification and denitrification rates are limited by different environmental factors, the work will provide insight on biological versus geochemical controls over two key processes supporting total N removal from aquatic ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The explosion of online student audiences, rapid growth of Open Educational Resources (OER), and the need to support individual learners are creating an unprecedented demand for digital assessments. Assessment authoring tools today are controlled by large organizations, require advanced skills and proprietary assessment delivery platforms with restrictive collaboration features. This inequity is particularly pronounced with respect to technology-enabled assessments (TEAs) which are sophisticated, digital assessments that enable deeper learning. This effort will democratize the process of authoring and sharing TEAs through the creation of intuitive end user tools that will enable educators without advanced technical skills to author and share TEAs. This has the potential to disrupt the status quo by empowering educators to take charge of the assessment creation and distribution landscape with ground-breaking tools that enable easy authoring and distribution of sophisticated TEAs without being restricted by a proprietary assessment system. Eventually, this will empower educators at scale by triggering the evolution of a peer-to-peer marketplace around the need for assessments, and impact hundreds of thousands of learners in secondary and tertiary education settings.<br/><br/><br/>This project will follow through on two principal innovations. The first is an end-user tool that will dramatically reduce the time and expertise required to author technology-enhanced assessments. The tool will facilitate intuitive authoring of TEAs by using symbolic representation of programming constructs. The second innovation is a new standard for representation of technology-enhanced assessments that makes them usable in any delivery platform, thus making the assessments platform-neutral. This effort will also advance the frontiers of authoring beyond individual assessments to the creation of adaptive assessment pathways that will provide personalization for diverse learners. It will explore novel technologies including the representation of TEAs as intelligent and portable objects that are interoperable with disparate assessment platforms through application programming interfaces. The research studies will provide insight into how the proposed innovations can make authoring of TEAs more efficient while lowering the skills barrier for educators, and the degree to which such TEAs are effective in eliciting student reasoning and thinking processes in foundational subjects. This will be achieved through a combination of usability and validation studies in partnership with secondary and post-secondary educators drawn from different institutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop is named in honor of Carl-Gustaf Rossby, an early pioneer of atmospheric science and department chair at the University of Chicago.<br/><br/>Advances in computing technology have enabled development of comprehensive climate models which use high resolution and include sophisticated representations of a large number of climate processes.  Such models can achieve a high degree of realism but only at the expense of great complexity, which limits their use for understanding climate system behaviors. Simple models are of course easier to understand, but such models can fundamentally misrepresent the system if they are simplified in ways that remove or disable key processes.  The task of choosing or developing models at the right level of complexity, or at appropriately varying levels of complexity, is thus a key challenge in climate research.  Climate scientists grapple with this challenge on a daily basis, yet it is not systematically addressed in the standard graduate school curriculum. <br/><br/>This workshop gives students an opportunity to learn modeling strategies involving simple and intermediate complexity models, choosing configurations appropriate for specific problems and applications.  The workshop is conducted through a combination of classroom lectures showcasing classical models and configurations that have led to important insights into the climate system, and hands-on research in a small group setting.  The workshop has intellectual merit as it addresses the important question of how one uses a model to arrive at understanding.  It has broader impacts by training the next generation of scientists in a key methodology of the discipline.

Opioids enable physicians to provide compassionate care to patients suffering from acute or chronic disease and trauma. The need for opioid analgesics is even more salient for surgeons anticipating the post-operative recovery of their patients and planning for end-of-life care. However, opioids are highly addictive medicines, a property that has been exploited for commercial gain by certain players in the pharmaceutical industry. The impact of this project will be to deliver a technology that transforms the existing supply chain for opioids by removing the need to grow opium poppy as a drug crop. Instead of sourcing poppy materials from poppy-growing countries, this new technology will allow for complete production of opioids in a secure industrial facility located in the United States where federal agencies can provide oversight and regulation. Additionally, investment in this technology will enable the development of many more existing and experimental medicines derived from plants, including greatly improved opioids with improved efficacy and safety, and cardiovascular and chemotherapeutic therapies that will extend and enhance human lives.   <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project will develop a bioprocess for opioid active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs). To date, the only commercially-competitive method for manufacturing opioids and related alkaloids is to extract these molecules from plants. However, Baker's yeast was recently engineered to biosynthesize opioids, which is a technological advance that could enable opioid production by fermentation. However, many technical hurdles remain in developing a reliable and cost-effective, commercially-viable production system based on existing strains. The objective of this Phase II project is to provide a complete demonstration and pilot-scale operation of an API bioprocess that is ready for industrial scale up. The research employs four approaches: 1) Further development of the engineered yeast strains, 2) scale up of fermentation from laboratory scale to pilot scale, 3) optimization of downstream recovery and purification, and 4) evaluation of the resulting products to establish their validity as drop-in-replacements for existing opioid APIs. The outcome will be a process validated at pilot scale and ready for technology transfer to a secure industrial facility that will make and sell into the opioids API market. This research will replace opium poppies with a modern bioprocess that resembles established, standardized pharmaceutical industry methods for antibiotic and biologic APIs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Early language development in turn depends on linguistic interactions with adults. Increasingly, researchers are using daylong audio recordings to study child language development and child-caregiver interactions. Compared to short language samples, daylong recordings capture the full range of experiences a child has over the course of a day. Daylong audio recordings are also being used in applied settings. For example, studies show that by the time they enter First Grade, children from higher socioeconomic backgrounds hear tens of millions more words than children from lower socioeconomic backgrounds, perpetuating social inequalities. Multiple large-scale intervention projects targeting low socioeconomic households, including the Thirty Million Words Initiative in Chicago and the Providence Talks program, are using daylong audio recordings to provide automated, personalized feedback to parents on when and how often their child hears adult words and experiences conversational turns. The features of daylong recordings that are advantageous for researchers and practitioners also pose unique challenges. For one, their long durations are ideal for studying the temporal dynamics of child-adult interaction, but taking advantage of the long durations requires the enlistment of automated speech recognition technology. Current automatic speech recognition systems have difficulties with child speech and are challenged by the noisy and varied acoustic environments represented in the recordings. Another challenge is that the recordings capture private moments that require long hours of human listening to remove. This makes it difficult for researchers to share the recordings publicly, so that the potential value of the recordings collected by individual research labs is not fully realized.<br/><br/>This project will create a new resource, called HomeBank, that will have three key components: (1) a public dataset containing daylong audio recordings that have had private information removed by human listeners, (2) a larger dataset containing about ten to one hundred times as many hours of recording that have not had private information removed and will be free but restricted to those who have demonstrated training in human research ethics, and (3) an open-source repository of computer programs to automatically analyze the daylong audio recordings. HomeBank will take advantage of an existing cyberinfrastructure for sharing linguistic data called TalkBank. The daylong audio recordings included in the datasets will represent both typically developing and clinical groups, a range of ages from newborn infants to school age children, and a range of language and socioeconomic backgrounds.

According to research, the greatest challenge facing teachers is overcoming the fact that between 25-66% of students are disengaged. Adapting instruction to each student's learning background has long been touted as the most effective method to drive student engagement; when instruction is individualized, engagement and outcomes increase dramatically. By calibrating video segments to student readiness, this project delivers appropriately challenging instruction to most effectively sustain engagement. Building on promising results in Phase I, the project aims to improve engagement and outcomes for all Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) students and, most pointedly, impacts English Language Learners (ELL) who often fall behind in STEM classes because instruction is beyond their readiness and in-class support is insufficient. Considering that ELL population is the fastest-growing population of public school students in the United States, this project has a significant potential to drive a STEM proficient workforce. Furthermore, given a strong, pre-existing client base, the project team is well positioned to penetrate the $110 million immediately addressable market. By 2020, the project team expects to be changing how 10% of U.S. middle schoolers absorb STEM instruction, opening a pathway to the adoption of powerful blended classroom techniques that enhance engagement, improve learning, and promote STEM careers.<br/><br/><br/><br/>The core innovation is a research-founded algorithm to deliver appropriately complex instruction through all video segments. For successful delivery of appropriately complex instructional video segments, the project (1) measures student complexity readiness, (2) maintains a database of video segments categorized by complexity (using factors such as syntactic and lexical complexity), and (3) uniquely unifies that information to identify a real-time next step for that student (which video segment should be shown). The aim is to enhance outcomes by providing each student an appropriately complex instructional pathway forward. With roots in the leading interactive video solution, this project is made possible through access to a large database of tagged and curated videos (hundreds of thousands) and questions (millions) and provides an unprecedented opportunity to develop adaptive instructional pathways for a diverse learning spectrum. For Phase II, the project team's goal is to deploy a fully functioning classroom prototype of a product built around a middle school Physical Science unit and measure impact on engagement and learning. The team will employ stimulated recall interviewing techniques, speak aloud interview protocols, and quantitative usage logs to assess the feasibility of highly-adaptive video instruction to increase student engagement. Evaluation will include both formative components (to gauge implementation and iterative improvement) as well as summative components to assess impact on engagement and learning outcomes in a mixed-methods design including multiple pilot studies with control and experiment groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This CAREER project examines how diversity can emerge from decision making of individual cells in a multicellular regenerative organism. Freshwater planarians are famous for their regenerative capabilities that are based on a large number of adult pluripotent stem cells (ASCs). These ASCs allow them to reproduce by binary fission, thus creating a clonal population and raising the question of how this species is able to create sufficient diversity to survive on evolutionary time scales. Using tools from statistical physics the PI recently demonstrated that reproduction is largely random, but that reproductive patterns exist whose molecular and physical determinants remain to be investigated. This project aims at testing the hypothesis that population diversity arises from a joint effect of the specifics of planarian reproduction mechanics and epigenetic diversity of ASCs in individual worms. The PI will integrate the research objectives of this proposal into three educational initiatives, which focus on ""learning through research"" and long-term engagement of students: (1) The PI is establishing a partnership with Vista Magnet Middle school that allows 6th graders to work together with her lab on research projects throughout the school year. (2) The PI will continue her efforts toward participation of high school students in research. In particular, she will continue to enable students from Torrey Pines High School to engage in research in her lab throughout the year, which allows them to design and execute their own science projects. (3) The PI will continue her efforts in promoting undergraduate research, in her own group as well as through a new research-centered, quantitative biology laboratory course that she has developed. The course will launch in 2016 and is currently for incoming biology freshmen only. In the context of this proposal, the PI will widen the student population to physics freshmen by adding more physics to the curriculum, and thus create a truly interdisciplinary research-driven laboratory course at the interface of biology and physics in terms of content and student population.<br/><br/>How cellular decision-making causes specific phenotypes in a population has received a lot of attention in the context of single celled organisms, but less is known about how epigenetic inheritance affects population diversity in multicellular organisms. This study will close this knowledge gap using planarians and a unique experimental setup, whereby thousands of individual reproductive events have already been recorded and form the statistical framework for the PI's studies on the population level. The PI's strategy is to (1) test the hypothesis that within individual planarians, ASCs are differentially distributed, in terms of spatial orientation and/or molecular and cellular characteristics (division and death rates, genetic and epigenetic diversity) through quantification of ASC localization, cellular dynamics, and single cell sequencing, (2) investigate the biomechanics of asexual reproduction to understand how resources get distributed among offspring using traction force measurements and time-lapse imaging, and (3) develop a mathematical model based on the cellular and organismal level experimental data to predict population level phenotypic diversity. The model will be tested by comparing its predictions with existing experimental data and the reproductive patterns of specially designed founder individuals in which all cells are known to originate from a single ASC, through RNA-seq and statistical analysis. Together, these approaches will allow the PI to test the hypothesis that spatial epigenetic heterogeneity of stem cells in individuals combined with a stochastic reproduction mechanism determine intraspecies phenotypic differences on the population level, which will be measured in terms of reproductive behaviors. The proposed work will shed new light onto the role of transgenerational epigenetic inheritance for the evolutionary success of asexual multicellular life. On a broader level, stem cell decision-making is currently receiving considerable attention because an understanding of how stem cells switch states stochastically and in response to environmental cues is indispensable for successful stem cell therapies.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly supported by the Physics of Living Systems program in the Division of Physics and the Cellular Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences"

Approximately nine billion pounds of ink is produced annually around the world.  Currently, ink is predominantly made of petroleum or inorganic chemicals mined from the earth. For example, carbon black is commonly used in traditional ink, which is derived from petroleum, not biodegradable, and toxic for humans. To solve this problem, nature has produced a multitude of molecules capable of replacing pigments currently utilized in ink. While many organisms that produce these alternatives are slow growing and require energy sources like sugar, photosynthetic microbes, such as cyanobacteria, are capable of being engineered in an efficient manner to produce pigments in ink formulations that are safe, renewable, and 100% biodegradable. This ink will be used by businesses for printing packaging, marketing material, and other printed products. Developing and integrating these ink products will decrease significantly the overall detrimental impact of traditional inks on the environment, and more importantly, human health. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to develop sustainable ink formulations using cyanobacteria as feedstock for producing optically black pigments for printing inks. This project will also engineer cyanobacteria cells capable of generating cellular pigments for a color spectrum of cyan, magenta, and yellow. These colored cyanobacteria will act as pigments that replace mined pigments found in traditional ink formulations, such as carbon black and cadmium. This project is developing a unique process in which extraction of pigments/dyes is not necessary, thus saving energy and reducing cost.   Using cyanobacteria cells as pigments creates a renewable source of biomass for bio-products, as these organisms leverage sunlight, carbon dioxide, wastewater and land otherwise unsuitable for conventional agriculture to rapidly generate biomass. In addition to the development of colorful renewable cyanobacteria strains, this project will focus on manufacturing thousands of pounds of ink products for testing and consumer use as well as testing the applicability of these natural pigments to act as colorants in the food and textile industries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will be the first time the iConference is held in England, and only the second time in Europe.  Since 2005, the iConferences have provided a forum where information scholars, researchers and professionals from around the world gather to share insights on critical information issues in contemporary society.  An openness to new ideas and research fields in information science is a primary characteristics of these events, which have been successful in bringing together people who otherwise might rarely interact with one another, thereby helping to promote interdisciplinary research.  Recent iConferences have drawn approximately 500 attendees, a testament to participants' appreciation for the inspiring sense of community, high quality research presentations, and myriad opportunities for engagement. The iConferences are presented by the iCaucus, now a consortium of 78 Information Schools in the United States and abroad (along with 8 associate members) dedicated to advancing the information field and preparing students to meet the information challenges of the 21st Century.  This year's theme is ""Transforming Digital Worlds""; more information may be found online at http://ischools.org/the-iconference.  The iConference doctoral colloquia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of interdisciplinary researchers focused on the interplay of information and technology in a social context, allowing them to develop a network both among themselves and with senior researchers. Participation is encouraged from a broad range of relevant disciplines, thereby expanding attendees' perspectives on their topics of study and promoting advancement of the field.  Due to timing constraints, the student participants in the 2018 event have already been selected.  The organizers worked proactively to maximize diversity along such key dimensions as institution type, research topic, methodological approach, disciplinary tradition, gender, ethnicity, and national or cultural background, so that the students' horizons are broadened at a critical stage in their professional development.  Of the 18 students accepted in total, 7 are women; 6 are studying in the UK, 5 in the US, 3 in Canada and 1 each in Germany, Israel, Nigeria and South Africa (2 of the UK-based students are originally from African countries).<br/><br/>The 2018 Doctoral Colloquium will be tightly integrated into the conference experience, starting with an orientation event highlighting specific content during the technical program, and culminating in a full day focused on peer-research critique and career development which will overlap with and immediately follow the closing session of the conference technical program on March 28.  The primary objective of the Doctoral Colloquium is to help train the next generation of information science researchers. To this end, it will provide the student participants with an environment in which they can share and discuss their goals, methods and results in order to gain feedback on their work both from the mentors and from other students, which should allow them to enhance their research.  The student participants will come away with a better understanding of the various research communities engaged in the study of information science, and learn how to position their work within the field.

Composites are increasingly used in mission critical applications where the material and the product must perform reliably, while at the same time improving productivity, increasing product quality and lowering cost. By precisely and consistently controlling tension, there are fewer voids, skips or uneven tows, resulting in a higher quality product. This is particularly important when safety is dependent on the structural integrity of the materials. Overall, composite applications are greener and have a positive environmental impact. Comparably priced but safer automobiles from composites will be lighter and consume less fuel. Composites further reduce reliance on fossil fuels, as they are the building blocks to harness renewable energy. Wind blades, solar panels and underwater turbines are all made from composites. This is a rapidly growing multi-billion-dollar market, and the projected share of the targeted tension control market is in the range of $200 million, growing equally fast, if not faster. <br/><br/>This project will solve a problem that has plagued the composites industry since its inception. Tension control is especially difficult (and yet very important in the composites industry), as multiple materials with different tear strengths and varying elasticity are combined to make stronger products. Lack of cost effective tension control has, up to this point, limited the speed and quality of finished products. Phase II objectives are to prototype and develop the manufacturing process for the Modular Tensioning Cartridge. The Phase II Objectives are: 1) Control package design - the goal is to create a central base station to provide power, communications and a central interface for the use of multiple Modular Tensioning Cartridge units; 2) Finalization - all successfully tested components must be assembled into a singular industrial grade prototype unit and then tested; 3) Product release - upon final prototype testing, field trials will be conducted to validate and finalize technology leading to full production. In phase I, feasibility of the individual components to meet performance requirements was successfully demonstrated. In Phase II, prototype units will be developed and tested refining the design to meet the performance expectations of the customers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet the origins of these cooperative abilities are a puzzle. Other species do not seem to engage in similar behaviors--indeed, humans have been characterized as a hyper-cooperative primate. One way to address why humans show these cooperative patterns is to examine how young children acquire these skills. Are young children initially selfish, and must be taught to become altruistic? Or do humans have a biological predisposition for altruism that even children exhibit? How do children learn to share a common resource and acquire ideas about fairness? With support of a NSF CAREER award, Dr. Felix Warneken (Harvard University) will conduct a comprehensive developmental study of children's cooperative behaviors. <br/><br/>This research aims to investigate the fundamental psychological processes that enable young children to cooperate with others. How do children detect that another person is in need? Under what circumstances are they motivated to help? By using experimental studies of young children, this research can address important questions about the interplay of biological predispositions found early in development and the socialization practices that influence the further development of these behaviors. In particular, the research will investigate when social expectations and norms that characterize cooperative behaviors in adults begin to play a role in child development. For example, adults often expect others to reciprocate favors and have norms about what constitutes a fair share of a valuable resource. Therefore, this research is to determine when during development children begin to attend to these norms when they cooperate with others. By integrating insights from evolutionary theory, social psychology, and child development, this project provides a comprehensive study of the skill-set for cooperation that children acquire across development. In addition, this research program will provide a wide range of training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in developmental psychology, including active participation of students in research, and a summer internship program with stipends for undergraduate students from underrepresented groups. It will also educate the broader public about psychological research through freely available educational material about the research projects for classroom instructors and the greater public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program aims to increase the Master Teaching Fellows? depth of content knowledge in the various STEM disciplines, and to enhance their instructional practices and pedagogical skills.  As a result, it is expected that they will be better able to lay the foundation for the students? future academic success. NebraskaSTEM will create a 14-month Master of Arts degree program in elementary education with a specialization in STEM Education. It will also work with the Master Teaching Fellows to develop and implement STEM initiatives (school/community-based STEM projects) in the rural schools in which they teach. The integration of STEM content areas will also be a powerful feature of NebraskaSTEM, enabling teachers to teach STEM in more integrated ways, thus enhancing integrated STEM learning for K-6 students in rural Nebraska schools.  The degree program and findings related to how a Noyce project can enhance rural elementary STEM teacher leadership will have potential value for other elementary teacher programs.  <br/><br/>Fifteen experienced, exemplary elementary teachers will be recruited from high-need rural elementary schools to receive professional growth experiences (including graduate coursework), mentoring as teacher leaders, and salary supplements of $10,000/year.   During the first project-year, they will take graduate coursework.  NebraskaSTEM coursework will lead to a master's degree for those without one; Master Teaching Fellows with master's degrees will take one less course and will not write a thesis.  Coursework will include four STEM content courses, a pedagogy course, a culture course focused on rural schools, and multiple leadership courses.  Master Teaching Fellows without prior coursework in education research will take courses to develop research skills.  Ongoing mentorship and professional development during years two through five will provide MTFs with opportunities to apply and share their knowledge and skills as they implement high-quality STEM instruction in their classrooms and serve as STEM leaders in their local schools and communities.  Developing elementary STEM leadership capacity in rural Nebraska schools is intended to positively affect the schools, districts, and regions in which the Master Teaching Fellows serve.

In this multidisciplinary project, the investigators want to understand what triggered the recent extinction of all of Madagascar's large native vertebrates, including its chimpanzee- and gorilla-sized lemurs, enormous 'elephant birds,' and horned crocodiles. The discovery of extraordinary deposits of fossils and stalagmites in previously-unexplored flooded and dry caves at Tsimanampesotse National Park (TNP) in southwestern Madagascar has opened new opportunities for researchers to address this question. An international team of anthropologists, geologists and ecologists will work with cave divers to retrieve and study fossils and stalagmites from the flooded caves and nearby dry deposits. By taking small samples of rock from stalagmites and studying their chemistry, the team will be able to reconstruct with great precision changes in habitat and rainfall over the past 50,000 years. Team members will also document changes in the presence or absence of small animals that may be excellent indicators of habitat transformation. Through this work, they will identify specific turning points in the catastrophic decline and extinction of Madagascar's large vertebrates, which will have broad implications for how to avoid future extinctions on the island and elsewhere. The team will support public science outreach with creation of 3D maps of the flooded caves and fossil deposits, and multi-language, multi-media educational displays. The displays will focus on conservation, and how understanding the past can inform the future. Finally, this project will support the doctoral dissertations of three graduate students, and build future opportunities for international collaborative research.    <br/><br/>The investigators will utilize state-of-the-art techniques from anthropology, ecology, cave science and paleoclimatology to tease apart how environmental changes and human activities affect communities of plants and animals. This work is challenging, especially since natural aridification (through reduced rainfall) and human disturbance (through setting fires, cutting trees, raising cattle or other introduced domesticated animals, and planting crops) can have similar devastating effects on the distribution and abundance of wild plants and animals. However, stalagmites preserve precisely-datable records of changes in local rainfall and vegetation. Consequently, it is possible to know when rainfall and vegetation co-varied, and when vegetation changed independent of rainfall, implying that some other agent, such as humans, was responsible. Bones and teeth of animals can preserve datable evidence of the diets, activities, movements and habitats of species that have survived, and those that have not. Sometimes traces on the surfaces of fossils themselves preserve evidence of how individuals died - for example, by succumbing to a predatory bird, carnivore or human. This project will tease apart the relative importance of environmental change and human activities, and build a chronology of the survival and extinction of species. Advances in the science of the chemistry of rocks, bones, and teeth, coupled with the old-fashioned tools of paleontological analysis (identifying fossils and recording their associations) have made all of this possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current metal AM platforms use expensive core components and consumable materials in high-priced machines that produce 99.9% dense parts. The proposed project calls into question the performance requirements that most American manufacturers have for industrial grade stainless steel parts. While these manufacturers require high performance, they cannot currently afford to take advantage of AM benefits due to the high capital expenditure, maintenance, and operating costs associated with current commercial technologies. This proposal re-examines the material performance, machine cost and reliability requirements necessary for a novel metal AM system to satisfy most American manufacturers' needs. In developing a low-cost AM alternative, the goal of the proposal is to allow an estimated over 50,000 American manufacturers to capitalize on the benefits of AM and simultaneously compete in an ultra-competitive, highly globalized manufacturing industry. In addition, procurement for low to medium volume order quantities (1000 - 20,000 pieces) is incredibly challenging with respect to high cost and long lead times. The proposed invention of a low-cost machine allows for never seen scalability in metal AM, allowing for smaller manufacturers to scale by taking advantage of meaningful order quantities and compete with the resources of large conglomerates. This research has broad implications in many industries and could be fundamentally enabling for the growth and prosperity of American manufacturing.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed project re-examines the need for high technology, high cost core components in currently available commercial metallic AM machines. Through an innovative deconstruction of the inkjet print head-based, binder jetting process, a method for producing metal end-use parts has been created. The 3DEO process is based on a novel combination of two low-tech and low cost, established technologies. The creation of a robust prototype with this novel method is a highly challenging, multi-faceted project involving key advances in materials science trough the development of a novel binder system compatible with the new process as well as a fundamental evaluation and improvement of material properties of the as-built parts. In addition, completely re-designed sintering cycles and a lengthy evaluation of shrinkage characteristics will be core challenges to overcome to achieve the tight tolerances manufacturing partners require. As such, these challenges will require tight cross-disciplinary collaboration for a meaningful outcome. The goal of the proposed research is to fabricate powder metallurgy parts of adequate structural integrity to satisfy industrial end-use requirements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With a growing EV market, the mass penetration of EVs into the utility grid will result in detrimental effects due to coincidence between utility peak power loading and EV charging. This impact will include increased peak loading and voltage drops that will call for over-investments in the network resulting in an overall high cost for the society. Therefore, advanced and practical interaction methods between vehicles, charging stations, and the utility grid need to be developed. Internet-inspired EV charge control offers a new paradigm-shift for EV charge control studies. This  project aims to build a new  autonomous and fair EV charge control technique that can penetrate into practice at large scales. The significance of the proposed idea lies in the effort to bring together a cyber-physical system that utilizes the prior art in end-to-end internet network congestion control with decentralized autonomous EV charging. The effort is inter-disciplinary and brings together ideas from computer science as well as power engineering to support mass integration of EVs into the conventional electric energy system. The proposed idea can impact the way all grid-connected power electronics systems are controlled. The algorithms developed in this work can be used to accelerate the integration of low-carbon energy sources such as solar photovoltaic systems.     <br/><br/>The proposed research develops a new family of EV charging algorithms by adopting some of the well-deployed end-to-end congestion control techniques in the Internet. The research objectives include (i) investigating distribution grid congestion through extensive data collection from field, modeling, and simulations to understand and extract the impacts of EV charging on voltage and frequency signatures at the end-nodes, (ii) design of entirely decentralized and localized EV charging algorithms that work autonomously, (iii) investigation of adaptive increase and decrease of EV charging rate according to the power flow congestion on the distribution network to attain proportional or max-min fair charging of EVs in a neighborhood, and (iv) exploration of hybrid charging architectures where more than one EV measurement can be utilized. The cyber-physical system that will be developed with this project will help the researchers understand and resolve issues relating to large scale electric vehicle integration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

TBI also represents a critical global health issue with high personal, societal, and economic costs to patients, caregivers, and communities as a whole. Although global health officials have recognized TBI as ""silent epidemic,"" public health approaches have seldom paid attention to the specific cultural and socioeconomic circumstances of this injury. In particular, understandings of life after trauma may vary across cultural contexts, with potentially powerful implications for TBI care within and outside clinical settings. This project, which trains a student in the methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, asks how TBI patients and their families engage popular and medical framings about injury, and how societal and medical understandings of brain injury are differentially affected by constraints of public care and new perspectives on mind and brain. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations and institutions invested in ameliorating the social and medical costs associated with traumatic brain injury.<br/><br/>In the research supported by this award, doctoral student Livia Garofalo, under the supervision and guidance of Dr. Rebecca Seligman, will investigate how Traumatic Brain Injury is cared for and experienced in a context of high TBI incidence, healthcare shortage, and increased attention towards neurological conditions. Through ethnographic research in public hospitals in the greater Buenos Aires area, the researcher will collect data through participant observation in clinical spaces and semi-structured interviews with patients, caregivers, and medical professionals, and conduct archival and media research. Triangulating this data will provide an assessment of the socioeconomic and political circumstances in which brain injury occurs, as well as the repercussions of neurotrauma at a broader societal level in the Argentine context. Buenos Aires, in particular, provides an apt site to investigate these issues as a large metropolitan area with a high influx of patients, thus providing a model for other dense and highly unequal urban contexts in the United States. Twelve months of ethnographic research will be conducted at two different hospitals with trauma centers, and their surrounding communities. Data will be collected through participant observation, interviews, and case studies and clinical histories, with medical professionals, TBI caregivers and their families, and TBI patients, with appropriate stratification based on age, gender, class, education, and hospital affiliation. Contributing to interdisciplinary conversations between cultural anthropology, science and technology studies, and global health, findings from this research will offer a multi-level anthropological perspective on how TBI incidence is stratified along socioeconomic lines, how emerging notions of ""brain health"" affect the attention towards brain injury, and how access to care is crucial for marginalized individuals and families to rebuild lives after trauma.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, when someone smiles at us or when we learn new information about someone, how does our perception of that person change? Given the everyday relevance of reacting to people, we need a clear understanding of how our brains generate emotional reactions towards others and how these emotions change our perceptions of others. In the past, knowledge of emotional processing in the human brain has largely been derived from behavioral, neuroimaging, and other methods. Though these tools have taught us much, we still do not have precise information about how quickly specific neuronal populations in the brain are activated and coordinated in response to emotion. Indeed, we do not yet fully understand how the human brain responds to emotional versus neutral stimuli. <br/><br/>The researchers, Drs. Parvizi and Gross, will use behavioral, psychophysiological, intracranial EEG (iEEG), and direct cortical stimulation (DCS) in conscious human subjects to test the effects of emotion on brain activity, especially in areas of the brain that selectively respond to emotion and to faces. Along with brain activity, they will also collect cardiac and pupillary activity, and then use DCS of the amygdala to reversibly alter this emotion-generative process. This research is expected to advance our understanding of the mechanisms underlying emotion generation, and the effects of these affective processes on the human visual perceptual system. Knowledge gained will set the stage for future research to investigate how clinical disorders and circuit-level abnormalities influence emotional processing in the human brain.

The December 9-21, 2018 school in Kampala, Uganda on ""Materials for Sustainable Energy"" will enable participants to explore shared scientific challenges and to help co-generate new knowledge and innovative solutions with colleagues who bring different national, cultural and institutional perspectives. World-renowned experts drawn from the United States, Africa and Europe will teach courses and provide opportunities for hands-on learning. The Institute promises to strengthen the capacity of the African Materials Science community by providing short-term graduate level training of African students and researchers by some of the world's top scientists during a two-week school. It benefits U.S. participants because it immerses them in a rich, transcontinental network of collaborators from Africa and Europe.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: Motivated by the need to develop and sustain positive international scientific relationships between the United States and African scientific communities, JUAMI employs a unique format to address four primary concerns: the creation of new knowledge and innovative solutions through cross-cultural collaborations, the need for U.S. graduate students and faculty to be engaged in international research collaborations and networks, the value to the United States of remaining a desired collaboration partner for African counterparts, and the need for graduate level training in materials science in Africa. This two-week school, which follows on earlier such schools, focuses on ""Materials for Sustainable Energy"", a topic at the frontier of materials research, with lectures offered by world-renowned experts recruited both internationally and locally. The curriculum includes directed hands-on activities, lectures, and the preparation/presentation of group proposals that give rise to ongoing cross-cultural collaborative research projects. Experts from the Searle Center for Advancing Learning and Teaching at Northwestern University provide ongoing assessment to quantify educational outcomes and improve pedagogy and program structure.

Recent advances in genetics have led to the identification of DNA methylation markers that change with age and could be used in new methods of age prediction, but generally using tissue types that are not always available in archaeological and forensic contexts. In this doctoral dissertation project, samples of human bone across a range of known ages will be analyzed to determine regions of the genome that change most reliably with age. These data will be used to develop a method of predicting an individual's age from their bones, which may show different patterns of methylation compared with other tissue types. The protocol and algorithms used in this project will be made freely available online, and the project will support graduate and undergraduate training and research in a STEM discipline.<br/><br/>While age-associated changes in DNA methylation are well known in the field of epigenetics, most research conducted so far has been in blood and saliva tissues that can be easily obtained from living individuals. DNA methylation patterns are known to differ significantly between tissue types, and epigenetic age prediction models developed for a particular tissue type cannot be automatically applied to another. Therefore, in order to extend the applicability of DNA methylation-based age prediction to forensic contexts, more research on specific forensically relevant tissues is necessary. In this project, the researchers will first generate a genome-wide DNA methylation dataset from human bone collected through a body donation program. DNA will be extracted from these bone samples and their DNA methylation levels will be measured at over 850,000 sites across the genome using a commercially available array. This dataset will be analyzed statistically to identify specific regions of the genome that vary in a strong, predictable manner with age. The DNA methylation patterns at these regions will be used to develop a statistical model that can accurately estimate chronological age. Finally, a protocol to target and measure methylation levels at only these highly age-associated genomic regions will be developed, which will allow the age estimation method to be applied at a much lower cost<br/><br/>This grant is jointly supported by NSF and the National Institute of Justice, Office of Investigative and Forensic Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These anatomical features are thought to have helped the earliest primates to navigate thin terminal branches of trees. However, the lack of claws may also have led to different locomotor (movement) behaviors for navigating large trees that could not be grasped. This doctoral dissertation project will study different primate and non-primate mammalian species to better understand locomotor changes with age, and in response to changing environments. These findings can help elucidate broader patterns of interaction between locomotor evolution and life history in the primate lineage. This project will support student training and mentoring at the K-12 through graduate levels. Data generated by this project will be used in an outreach lesson plan demonstrating how animal motion can be understood as simple machines for a STEM education program for elementary to middle school age girls in Durham, NC through Duke University, and for all ages attending annual public outreach days at the Duke Lemur Center.  <br/>  <br/>The goal of this project is to understand primate locomotor tradeoffs between selection for or maintenance of morphological specialization for movement in specific places (e.g. thin branches), while still needing to move through and between more general (e.g. trees, the ground) environments. Through comparative analysis of descending locomotion and mechanics in eight primate species, and three non-primate mammals, this project examines behavioral shifts in response to changing environmental conditions by experimentally modifying support orientation and size. Animals are filmed crossing increasingly steep and thick supports, and it is predicted that primates will abandon headfirst walking in favor of alternative behaviors, such as leaping, sliding, and rear-first descending in response to the biomechanical challenges of these supports, while non-primate mammals will continue to move headfirst with the aid of their claws. The comparative sample features species from a wide range of body sizes (0.06 to 3.5 kg), limb proportions, and behavioral specializations. Within each species, individuals of different ages are compared to assess how aging affects arboreal locomotion, which would have been a key challenge incurred during the evolution of increasingly long lifespans in the primate lineage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ENSO has a dramatic impact on the climate of the Galapagos Islands, and this impact is preserved in paleoclimate records from the archipelago. But published paleoclimate records from the Galapagos yield disagreeing versions of the islands' recent climate history, including the magnitude of recent warming and the range and timing of ENSO variability. <br/><br/>To resolve these disagreements, this project will develop reconstructions of regional sea surface temperature using the isotope geochemistry of long-lived, annually banded corals. With these records, which directly track ocean conditions, important questions about recent climate variability and change in this iconic region can be addressed. For example, is the Galapagos warming as fast as the rest of the world? What is the history of El Niño variability in the region? Do changes in this region coincide with periods of higher-latitude climate variability such as cooler (""Little Ice Age"") conditions between 1500-1850? Understanding the full range of ENSO variability and ongoing trends is important locally, for improving conservation planning and climate adaptation efforts in the Galapagos National Park and Marine Protected Area.

For example, regulations in the water sector to preserve freshwater may restrict water usage in the power sector, likely causing reduced available generation capacities and hence jeopardizing the reliability of power systems. On the other hand, environmental policies only focused on the power sector, such as those encouraging retrofitting or installing carbon dioxide capture and sequestration capabilities to existing and new coal plants would further constrain the water system as coal plants with carbon sequestration are among the heaviest users of water. Thus, there is a clear need to better understand and manage the interdependence of critical infrastructure systems to promote sustainability across all systems, while not undermining economic and reliability considerations. This proposed work aims to address this need through the theory, modeling and computation of large-scale, interdependent complex systems by way of distributed, highly scalable computing. The results will be widely disseminated through publications and seminars. Further, the project team will leverage established institutional outreach programs to the general public, especially to high-school students and teachers, such as through the Engineering Projects In Community Service program and Purdue?s Energy Academy. <br/><br/>The grand vision of this project is to promote sustainability across interdependent systems, as well as to achieve economic efficiency and to maintain reliability through decentralized yet coordinated management of individual systems by establishing a complete modeling, analytical, and computational framework based upon the general class of augmented Lagrangian methods originating from convex optimization. While the augmented Lagrangian method is not a new algorithm, the current implementation of such algorithms has not taken advantage of its distributed feature, which would be particularly suitable to deal with large-scale, interlinked systems. One of the major goals of this work is to establish the theoretical foundations of distributed Lagrangian methods and to implement the algorithms on supercomputer clusters to demonstrate the benefits of distributed computing. This research aims to pave the way for cloud computing such that the algorithms can be used by decision-makers even without access to supercomputers. Another contribution is that the augmented Lagrangian method algorithms will be extended to incorporate stochastic data, both in terms of theoretical issues such as algorithm convergence as well as practical implementation. The computational methods will be tested and validated through real-world models of interdependent power and water systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By means of various high-precision on-board sensors, these devices capture rich contextual information about the wearer and his environment to enable several new and useful applications. However, this diverse set of on-board sensors also provides an additional attack surface. Access to these sensors, if not controlled appropriately, can be used as a side-channel by an adversary keen on obtaining private and sensitive information belonging to the wearer. Moreover, active misuse detection and resistance of these wearable device sensors is not straightforward. There is currently a lack of understanding of the various side-channel security vulnerabilities that are possible due to wearable devices and there is an urgent need to study the means for continuously protecting against them. The research in this project addresses this very timely topic.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is twofold: first, to demonstrate that wearable devices enable novel side-channel security and privacy threats, and second, to design continuous authentication techniques and adaptive access control mechanisms to survive these threats. Specifically, this research will evaluate private data inference and wearer tracking threats in wearable devices that utilize unprotected sensors as side-channels. This will be accomplished by designing appropriate learning-based classification and prediction mechanisms that can be used by an adversary for inferring sensitive data. On the protection front, this project will develop a multi-sensor activity and identity classification framework. This framework will leverage rich contextual sensor data (e.g., fine-grained movements, application usage and critical body parameters) to enable continuous identification and authentication of legitimate wearers and their activities. <br/><br/>By studying security and privacy preferences of a diverse population of users, this research will develop usable activity-based access control tools for this new wearable device paradigm. A significant research thrust of this project is to develop adaptive data-sharing mechanisms for dynamically regulating access to sensor data based on the wearers' security preferences, current context and perceived threats. Such mechanisms will serve as a good middle-ground between giving full access (no security) and making manual decisions for each access (poor usability).

Several recent reports indicate that injuries and fatalities in pedestrian-related accidents are steadily rising and that pedestrian distraction is one of the leading causes in such accidents. Existing systems and techniques for improving pedestrian safety, which primarily operate on users' smartphones and mobile devices in a stand-alone fashion, have several design drawbacks and performance and usability concerns that have precluded their successful adoption and usage. The goal of this project is to improve pedestrian safety by designing accurate, efficient and usable tools and techniques, which can be easily adopted by urban users. <br/><br/>In order to accomplish this goal, this project plans to pursue a focused research agenda involving novel technologies and several exploratory and untested ideas. As part of the proposed pedestrian safety framework, accurate and energy-efficient on-device distraction detection techniques will be developed by employing multi-sensor and heterogeneous data available from upcoming mobile and wearable devices. In this direction, supervised and semi-supervised learning will be used to design efficient activity classification and distraction prediction techniques which will be empirically evaluated using proof-of-concept implementations. Unlike existing stand-alone approaches, the proposed framework employs a connected-community approach to accurately capture the impact of both a pedestrian's own actions, as well as the actions of others, on his/her safety. This involves the design and implementation of a privacy-preserving and cloud-assisted data-analytics engine to capture, analyze and notify pedestrians of impending hazardous situations from the crowd-sourced distraction data obtained from participating users. Finally, a comprehensive performance and usability evaluation will be conducted by deploying a large-scale testbed involving participants from Wichita State University's (WSU) campus community.  The project outcomes, including the planned testbed, will have a significant impact on improving pedestrian safety within the WSU campus community. If successful, similar trials at an urban or city-wide scale can also be envisioned. In addition to improving pedestrian safety, this project will educate users and participants on the impact of technology on pedestrian safety and its role in improving the same. Project outcomes and results will be disseminated by means of peer-reviewed publications, white papers and open-source applications. Applications and anonymous data collected from the planned testbed will be appropriately disseminated to facilitate additional research and advances in the area of pedestrian safety technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Making predictions or decisions out of graphical models involves challenging #P-hard computational problems, and efficient approximation methods are highly demanded. The most useful approximations should give not only accurate estimates, but also (1) come with tight and conservative error bounds and (2) can be improved continuously to trade time for increased accuracy in a memory efficient and predictable way (an ""anytime"" property). Such algorithms should allow us to solve easy problems with strong certificates of accuracy, and also identify harder problems together with clear guidance for further improvement. Unfortunately, most state-of-the-art methods, including deterministic variational methods and Monte Carlo-based methods, often do not fully satisfy these criteria.  <br/><br/>This project aims to develop a new generation of inference tools with tight non-asymptotic confidence bounds and anytime property. Based on several key insights that connect variational inference with non-asymptotic bounds of Monte Carlo, the PI derives a spectrum of powerful methods that naturally integrate and combine the advantages of these two approaches, providing a new foundation for more reliable inference. The project also develops novel non-asymptotic error bounds for advanced Monte Carlo methods such as annealed importance sampling (AIS), based on which the researchers construct highly efficient estimates and bounds built on the state-of-the-art AIS. The approaches are tested extensively on various application domains, and provide practical guidance and open source packages for practitioners. The new powerful anytime, error-aware inference tools will lead much more reliable use of graphical models across different application domains, greatly expanding our ability of reasoning over large datasets and complex phenomena.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This has correspondingly aggravated water scarcity, which threatens the long-term sustainability of water resources. Since the US is one of the largest in terms of water footprint, the country is very vulnerable to moderate and severe drought. To mitigate the drought vulnerability, an effective drought monitoring and forecasting system with assessment of drought recovery time is critical for decision makers. This project will develop a cyber-enabled ensemble data assimilation and terrestrial modeling system to characterize the land surface condition for not only assessing the agricultural drought but also providing the initial condition for probabilistic drought forecasting. These estimates will provide the basis for drought recovery estimation. The project will serve as a prototype to build capacity for large-scale drought studies and applications, and will directly enhance the ability of state water managers to take appropriate and timely measures during periods of water scarcity as a result of drought.<br/><br/>The study relies on a variety of massive earth and environmental observational data in connection with advanced dynamical and Bayesian modeling, to account for uncertainties and provide reliable drought estimation with the goal to further freshwater resource sustainability. Ensemble modeling and probabilistic estimation to quantify the uncertainties in Earth system science by means of data assimilation has been a salient bottleneck in operationalization. Due to the multi-scale nature of hydrologic processes and under-determinedness of most hydrologic systems as well as the presence of epistemic and random uncertainties, dynamic physical-based and stochastic modeling to probabilistically characterize drought onset and predict it at seasonal scale requires proper parameterization of the system. This research proposes a modern ensemble data assimilation system operating in real time to characterize land surface conditions for monitoring drought, develops a computational framework for effective data assimilation, and implements an approach that targets computational scalability, power, and reliability in the computational framework."

The coupling between electrons and protons plays a vital role in a wide range of biological and chemical processes, including photosynthesis, respiration, and energy production in solar cells. It is difficult to develop computational approaches to accurately describe this coupling because electrons and protons are so light that they must be treated quantum mechanically. After extensive assessment and validation, these computational methods will be incorporated into a computer program that will be available to the public.

Deciphering the nature of this so-called Dark Matter is of fundamental importance to cosmology, astrophysics, and high-energy particle physics. One of the most exciting quests in particle physics is the search for new particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics. Extensions of the Standard Model predict not only new particles with large masses but also some with very small masses. Such a candidate is the axion, which has been introduced to explain the smallness of Charge-Parity (CP) violation in Quantum Chromodynamics and which turns out to also be a prime candidate for a constituent of the dark matter in the universe. This award will provide funds for R&D towards developing a new experiment to search for axion-like interactions between nuclei at sub-millimeter ranges. While participating in this research, a team of postdocs, graduate students and undergraduate researchers will be broadly trained in the various techniques of experimental atomic physics such as low-temperature physics, magnetic shielding, vacuum systems and modeling. <br/><br/>The experiment involves a rotating non-magnetic mass to source the axion field, and a dense ensemble of laser-polarized He-3 nuclei to detect the axion field by NMR. The signal from an axion field can be resonantly enhanced by properly modulating the axion potential at the nuclear spin precession frequency. The method has the potential to improve previous experimental and astrophysical bounds on axions by several orders of magnitude and probe deep into the theoretically interesting regime for the Peccei-Quinn (PQ) axion. The experiment is also sensitive to more exotic axion-like particles. It is estimated that this method can ultimately exceed present laboratory constraints on spin-dependent short-range forces by up to eight orders of magnitude and can improve on the combined laboratory/astrophysical limits by a factor of 10^4 in the prime axion range of f_a between 10^9 and 10^12, probing deep into the theoretically interesting regime for the PQ axion. In contrast to cosmic axion searches, the setup is sensitive to the axion even if it does not make up most of the dark matter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The general strategy is to derive and computationally validate a set of efficient estimators for population-genetic parameters at three levels: individual genomes; multiple individuals within populations; and multiple populations. Specific subprojects include the measurement of patterns of variation and covariation among nucleotide sites, levels of population subdivision, and the development of novel methods to facilitate genome assembly and the refinement of genetic maps.

Among the various toxicity effects observed, genotoxicity (the damage to genes from chemicals) is of particular concern to human and other lives because genotoxicity from nanomaterial (nanogenotoxicity) can potentially cause cells to mutate and eventually lead to cancer. This study will demonstrate the application of a new high-throughput, rapid and effective nanogenotoxicity assay platform and a new mechanism-driven hierarchical model framework that will be tested. The results of the research will fill in the urgent knowledge gap in mechanistic understanding of the environmental and health impact of CNMs. This research has significant benefits to the environment and public health protection. The outcome from the research will aid strategies related to nanoscience and technology, as well as elucidate the environmental and health implications of nanomaterials, which will help bridge the gap between scientific research, creation of commercial products and public health protection. In terms of broader impact on the community, the synergized arrays of education outreach and public education programs will present the technology, benefits, and societal and environmental impact of nanotechnology to a wide range of audiences at many levels. For example, PI Gu had initiated the BEST (Biotechnology for the Environment, Showcase and Training) program as part of a CAREER award. With this proposal, she will be able to expand that program, as well as collaborate with additional existing programs (e.g. a RET program, NEU CONNECTIONS, etc) to promote training of students and teachers.

Genotoxicity of four different CNMs (SWCNT, fullerene C60, carbon black and graphene) and their variations will be evaluated by measuring the NM-induced expression alteration in genes and proteins that are indicative or essential for the known DNA damage and repair pathways, using the newly developed molecular genotoxicity assay platform and, with the extension to multiple species across different taxonomic levels (bacteria, yeast and human). Dose-response relationships and molecular genotoxicity endpoints will be determined using the molecular effect level index (MELI) recently proposed by us. To validate the proposed molecular assay and confirm the genotoxicity of CNMs tested, conventional phenotypic genotoxcity assays will be performed in parallel. An array of modern techniques will be employed to determine the purity, elemental composition, dimension, surface chemistry, aggregate size and state, zeta potential, hydrophilicity etc. of the CNMs. A prototype nanogenotoxicity QSAR model with hierarchical structures that integrates current QSAR framework with molecular bioassay information through correlative links among CNMs descriptors, DNA damage mechanism-specific molecular endpoints and phenotypic genotoxicity endpoints will be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In biopharmaceutical manufacturing, low drug solubility is the most common barrier to developing an effective pre-clinical drug formulation. Pre-clinical formulation is critical to the eventual success of a drug, with major financial consequences of poor drug solubility during pre-clinical formulation. Nearly 70-80% of all drugs fail during pre-clinical and phase I clinical development, with an average investment loss of $100-800 million per drug. Additionally, there are major problems with the biocompatibility of synthetic surfactants such as Tween 80 used to improve drug solubility; Tween 80 has been shown to cause severe side-effects such as anaphylaxis in IV chemotherapeutic formulations. Thus, there is a current, unmet need to develop (1) a detailed understanding of how altering surfactant structure influences drug solubiization to prevent poor drug solubility and associated side-effects and (2) a flexible method for high-yield synthesis of novel biosurfactants at a cost competitive with currently used synthetic surfactants such as Tween 80. The goal of this CAREER proposal is to develop a series of biocompatible biosurfactants capable of overcoming the current limitations of commercial drug formulations in terms of cost, scale and targeted delivery. The results of this work will contribute directly to improved drug bioavailability, biocompatibility and efficacy and enable use of designed biosurfactants in a wide range of commercial drug formulations. Additionally, in partnership with Northampton Community College (NCC), the PI will develop a laboratory course for Lehigh and NCC students in biomanufacturing, and organize a 10-week summer internship program for NCC students interested in pursuing post-graduate studies in STEM fields. Ultimately, the biosurfactant structure, function and design studies described in this CAREER proposal will provide a unique, long-term project that has direct application to a wide range of challenges in drug formulation as well as a unique, cross-institutional educational opportunity for Lehigh and NCC students in STEM-related fields.<br/><br/>The PI will utilize an integrated, structure-guided approach to design variants of the protein hydrophobin (HYD), a naturally-occurring, fungal biosurfactant, to improve drug solubility, biocompatibility and targeted delivery. Importantly, a major focus of this work is on development and production of designed biosurfactants at a scale and cost competitive with synthetic surfactants such as Tween 80. The challenges of engineering novel functions into the biosurfactant to improve targeting and drug solubility will be addressed through (1) engineering HYD variants with pH-dependent surface activity (pH-HYD) for targeted drug release, (2) evolving HYD variants for enhanced solubilization (s-HYD) of a given target drug and (3) integrating both pH- and s-HYD into a commercial-scale formulation that maximizes drug solubility and targeting. Using previous structural information regarding HYD, the investigator will design a series of electrostatically-stabilized HYD variants, each of which will enable pH-dependent assembly and disassembly. Similarly, using a high-yield secretion system developed for HYD coupled to high-throughput methods for characterization, the PI will utilize directed evolution to select HYD variants that enhance drug solubility using a series of model hydrophobic drug compounds as benchmarks. Lastly, by integrating both engineered and evolved HYD variants, a novel, hybrid formulation will be identified that can both deliver drug at high solubility and target delivery effectively. Ultimately, this approach will lead to tailored biosurfactant properties precisely to enable formulation of previously insoluble drugs, engineer enhanced targeting mechanisms such as pH (pH-HYD) to reduce side-effects associated with current drug formulations and develop a low-cost, scalable and sustainable route for biosurfactant biomanufacturing that is broadly applicable to a wide range of formulation application.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies of interdisciplinary research teams indicate that team members struggle to achieve knowledge synthesis across disciplines. Issues arise due to the inability of team members to develop deep knowledge at the frontier of other disciplines and to connect that knowledge with their own expertise to provide a collaborative path forward. The ability to work collaboratively in a research team with others who may hold very different perspectives is a critical aspect of preparing today's students to meet future workforce demands. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award in the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) track is a collaborative project led by the University of Texas at El Paso involving graduate students and faculty from multiple institutions.  The project will test a new model for training graduate student teams in environmental sciences to overcome knowledge integration and synthesis challenges.<br/><br/>This model will draw on findings from cognitive, learning, and social sciences to develop and test training for graduate students and faculty in model-based reasoning approaches. Model-based reasoning theory posits that humans reason by constructing an internal mental model of the situations, events, and processes that they encounter, and that external representations can be used to facilitate construction of these mental models. External representations include the use of analogies, metaphor, visual models, diagrams and/or other representations for abstraction and communication of complex concepts. In a team setting, these external representations are called boundary negotiating objects.  This project will place doctoral students in multidisciplinary teams and facilitate a structured, participatory process that includes a progression of standard, individual and group model-based reasoning activities as well as instruction on the purposeful co-creation of boundary negotiating objects.  Students from multiple institutions will learn together through two-week summer experiences; students who are conducting research in conjunction with larger interdisciplinary teams will be targeted.  In addition, the project will train faculty from multiple institution in the model.  The project will examine the implementation of ten faculty members.  Survey, interview, and digital data will be collected to examine how graduate students respond to being directly exposed to theories behind the approach as well as the efficacy of the approach as faculty employ it in their graduate classes. This design will allow comparison of the outcomes from guiding students on what to do, versus teaching students why and how to do it.  <br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new, potentially transformative, and scalable models for STEM graduate education training.

For many years, researchers argued that providing individuals and communities with open access to natural resources would inevitably lead to overuse and ultimately to destruction through deforestation, overfishing, overgrazing, and other environmentally detrimental activities. However, subsequent research by political scientist and Nobel laureate Dr. Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues found that this ""tragedy of the commons"" scenario is not universal. Instead, some small communities do effectively manage local lands without external oversight. This appears to occur most often when communities have enduring, well-developed social norms for maintaining the natural environment and for sanctioning individuals who violate community standards. But these findings raise another question: If some communities can do it, why not all? Why are some communities effective at preserving their natural resources while others are not? The research supported by this award seeks to answer that question. Anthropologist Dr. Sean S. Downey (University of Maryland) will test the theory effective land management rests on more than just having the right social norms; in addition, he suggests, the social norms, the particular characteristics of the local environment, and the ecosystem services the environment provides to local users must work together to produce ecological sustainability.<br/><br/>Few communities in the United States are both free of external oversight and also dependent primarily on the local natural environment for subsistence. Therefore, Dr. Downey and his team will travel to two forest-based villages located in a remote area in southern Belize to test the theory. The communities have a demonstrated history of local ecological knowledge and environmental stewardship but there has historically been little top-down environmental management: an ideal location for understanding how local community norms and natural ecosystem dynamics interact and create a sustainable forestry system. The researchers will collect data through multiple methods: household surveys; farmer land use interviews; and close monitoring of how the communities affect their forests. The monitoring will be accomplished through piecing together high-resolution photographs of the usage areas around each village using a GPS-linked multi-spectral camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle. These photos will subsequently be stitched together into geo-referenced two-dimensional photo-mosaics, ground-truthed through farm plots surveys, and analyzed to understand how these environments provide for the local communities, how they are affected by human farming activity, and also how these forests recover to sustain future generations. The research team will also conduct behavioral economics experiments to assess how cooperation and punishment in the communities relate to natural resource use, and use computational analysis to determine the most important social and natural factors for effective long-term natural resource management. The project also has several integrated educational goals, including training the next generation of American scientists, educators, and policy-makers in the science of complexity; developing coursework and facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration at the University of Maryland; and offering a service learning project for American students in Belize. Ultimately, findings from this research will provide insight into the factors that promote effective local management of natural resources and this could lead to better and more efficient management of public lands at a significant cost savings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ready availability of cells is crucial for the wide application and eventual success of cell-based therapies involving tissue engineering, regenerative medicine, cell transplantation, blood transfusion, and stem cell therapy. The objective of this project is to perform a systematic investigation to understand the protective effect of trehalose, a nontoxic sugar, during freezing and drying of trehalose-laden human adipose-derived stem cells (hADSCs) and in banking the dried cells at ambient temperature. As trehalose has been used for many lower organisms to survive extreme cold and drought in nature, it is hypothesized that trehalose-laden stem cells will behave similarly.  <br/><br/>This project will have a significant impact on improving healthcare by facilitating the development of cell lyopreservation as an enabling technology for the success of cell-based medical treatments. The use of a nontoxic sugar (trehalose) to replace toxic chemicals (e.g., dimethyl sulfoxide or DMSO) for cell banking is well aligned with the NSF SusCHEM initiative to replace toxic chemicals with earth-abundant, inexpensive, and benign materials. To understand the fundamental science of drying living cells for banking in a state of suspended animation at ambient temperature, three specific research tasks are proposed. These include  (i) investigation of the effect of freeze-drying parameters on the kinetics of drying trehalose solutions important for lyopreservation of primary hADSCs and on the microscopic morphology of the dried products, using freeze-drying microscopy and a benchtop freeze-dryer for small and large samples, respectively; (ii) simulation and experimental quantification of the biophysical responses of the trehalose-laden hADSCs to freezing and drying including cell dehydration and intracellular ice formation important for cell survival; and (iii) analysis of the morphology, survival, long-term proliferation, and stem cell properties and functions of the primary hADSCs after freeze-drying and banking at ambient temperature. The stem cell properties and functions will be assessed by the expression of stem cell gene and protein markers and their capability of adipogenic, osteogenic, and chondrogenic differentiation. A high survival and intact function of the primary hADSCs are anticipated after freeze-drying and long-term storage at ambient temperature under optimal conditions.<br/>This award by the Biotechnology and Biochemical Engineering Program of the CBET Division is cosponsored by the Biomaterials Program of the Division of Materials Research."

This project aims to decrease, by one to two orders of magnitude, how long those networks are down each month.<br/><br/>The project will explore the design of two components that can contribute significantly towards decreasing network downtime.  One component will be a new highly-available control plane that will include a new replication protocol that provides strong consistency and resilience to the failure of an external failure detector while retaining as many of the desirable properties of current less-available designs (e.g., small resource footprint) as possible. The other component will be an automated management plane that will raise the level of abstraction of specifying a management operation (MOp) on the network, thereby allowing automated software to  synthesize and manage the sequence of steps necessary to achieve a complex network MOp such as upgrading software on a large network.<br/><br/>Global Internet services are an integral part of modern life and increasing their availability will benefit society. The project plans include developing software prototypes and working closely with large Internet services to increase the likelihood of technology transfer.

To take an example, imagine Adam says ""I could use a cup of coffee"" and Bob responds by saying ""There's a place called Joe's around the corner."" We understand this as a coherent exchange even though Adam's utterance wasn't phrased overtly as a question and Bob didn't explicitly say that Joe's sells coffee. Extracting this rich additional meaning requires us to consider sentences in light of both the context they are used in and the cooperative motivations of Adam and Bob in using language (what are called ""pragmatic inferences""). This project is devoted to constructing formal models of these pragmatic inferences. Modeling pragmatic inference is a major scientific challenge in the study of language and the human mind and a key to the future development of autonomous intelligent systems that can communicate with humans using natural language. Machines that can do robust language understanding in context will pave the way for societally beneficial technological applications such as adaptive intelligent tutoring and assistive technologies. <br/><br/>The technical core of the project involves developing and extending models of pragmatic reasoning, drawing on ideas and insights from decision theory, probabilistic models of cognition, bounded rationality, and linguistics.  In particular, the work extends the recently developed family of ""rational speech act"" (RSA) models, which provides a set of formal tools that can be used to address basic challenges in psycholinguistics concerning how major principles of pragmatic inference fall out of simple assumptions about cooperativity and shared context among conversation participants. This enterprise has the potential to fill a major open theoretical gap in our scientific understanding of human language and social cognition. Project work includes developing computational Bayesian models of semantic composition and pragmatic inference and testing those models using controlled psycholinguistic experiments.  The work will also yield new models and publicly available datasets and will contribute to interdisciplinary connections by creating and reinforcing links between linguistics, psychology, and computer science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because the field is concerned with the development of tools for analyzing, organizing, and arranging discrete data, combinatorial methods are essential in many scientific areas such as genomics, computer science, statistics, and physics. The methods can often be traced back to research inspired by problems in algebra and geometry. For example, the RSA public-key encryption algorithm is based on a combinatorial result in modular arithmetic. This research project is devoted to developing combinatorial techniques for attacking problems that connect to algebraic and geometric areas such as symmetric function theory, a subject with applications to probability and statistical mechanics. The investigation will make use of a computational symbolic algebra system and will further develop the SAGE open-source mathematics software suite. <br/><br/>This research project spans combinatorial problems in representation theory, algebraic geometry, and physics. The inspiration comes from the central importance of constructions such as tableaux and Bruhat posets in the classical studies of representations of the complex linear group and Schubert calculus. The precision of combinatorics is carried to more abstract problems by a distinguished Schur basis for the algebra of symmetric functions. The project concerns variations on the classical theories that address subtle questions about geometric Gromov-Witten invariants, symmetric functions over a field of parameters, bi-graded representations, and quantum integrable systems. A priority is to develop the necessary combinatorial framework for the contemporary set of problems. The venture goes hand in hand with an investigation of refined physical, geometric, and algebraic theories attached to the combinatorics. The resulting combinatorial constructions will lend computational facility to related application areas."

Engineers will need to be able to think holistically about a myriad of factors and visualize a solution that solves the technical problem while satisfying cultural, environmental, societal, and economic constraints. Spatial visualization skills have been linked to success in engineering and mathematics as well as to creativity and technical innovation. Unfortunately, of all of the cognitive processes identified through previous research, spatial skills exhibit the most robust gender differences, favoring males. Improving spatial skills has been shown to be effective in improving the success of engineering students, particularly women.<br/><br/>This project is conducting a large-scale study involving undergraduate engineering students in order to answer research questions regarding the role that spatial visualization plays in solving two types of engineering problems. Convergent problems are typically those that have a unique solution that is based on prior theories. Divergent problems have multiple possible solutions. Since engineers are asked to solve both types of problems, it is important to know how spatial visualization skills impact how students attempt to solve these problems and the solutions that are ultimately obtained. The project is employing a mixed methods approach that includes electroencephalograms (EEGs) as a brain imaging technique to answer questions about the links between spatial visualization and engineering problem solving.  The results from this research will close a gap in what is currently known about brain function, spatial visualization and engineering problem solving. The results could be used to improve the success of students in undergraduate engineering degree programs and to ensure the full participation of women in the engineering workforce.

This approach is based on mining the Protein Data Bank for small peptides (3-6mers) within beta-strands that are naturally paired to segments of the target epitope in neighboring beta-strands. By identifying multiple small peptides that are complementary to the target epitope and which overlap with each other, larger complementary peptides will be generated. These peptides will be evaluated for their ability to mediate antibody binding to the target epitope when grafted into the complementarity determining regions (CDRs) of antibody fragments.

However, there is a need to gain a better understanding of how system retrofits will impact failure resiliency and environmental sustainability, and further how the design of resilient and sustainable engineered system must be adapted to take frequent retrofit activities into account. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research that will provide this missing knowledge.  Specifically, it will develop of a novel design framework with tools for system modeling, analysis and design that can be used to concurrently realize resiliency and enhance sustainability in system designs while considering system retrofits. Results from this research will likely stimulate growth in several technologically advanced industries such as the green energy, aviation, or automotive industries, which suffer from catastrophic failures and high maintenance costs at the post system design stage.  By providing new design methods and tools for failure resilient realization and sustainability enhancement, the total lifetime cost of ownership of such systems can likely be reduced significantly. This research offers unique opportunities for researchers across the fields of engineering design, failure prognosis and sustainability, and will train students in an interdisciplinary learning environment. Educational initiatives with a wide range of dissemination and outreach programs will attract students, especially underrepresented groups, to engineering careers. <br/><br/>This research pioneers a new design paradigm for resiliency and sustainability by integrating design of system functions, failure prognosis, and system retrofits in a unified design framework. Such an effort has been neglected in the past because quantitative analysis methods for failure prognosis and system retrofits were only applicable in the use-phase of a system and were not suited for early-stage design. This research encompasses four thrusts: 1) resiliency and sustainability quantification with retrofits, 2) predictive resiliency and sustainability analysis, 3) concurrent design for resiliency and sustainability, and 4) design validation through collaborations with three leading industry partners. The fundamental research will be rooted in a new theory for resilience and will specifically address the challenge of post-design retrofits in engineering system design. This research will be the first attempt to adapt the concept of resilience and integrate it into system design while simultaneously considering environmental sustainability. The research outcome will open up a new avenue for research to exploit innovative methodologies leading to design of resilient and sustainable engineered systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many domains, such as vaccination, resource conservation, or blood donation, the outcome that is optimal for the group cannot be achieved unless individuals act beyond their narrow self-interest.  The current research harnesses the principle of signaling to develop and test interventions that may inspire pro-social behavior by appealing to agents' desire to appear prosocial.  Whereas some people may be motivated to contribute to the public good simply by altruistic concerns for others, even absent those purely altruistic motives, nearly everyone likes to be viewed by others as a prosocial person or to think of themselves as prosocial.  In economic terms, this idea is captured by the concept of signaling -- engaging in a behavior that signals the type of person one is. Thus, a self-interested reason to engage in pro-social behavior is to signal (to oneself or to others) that one is a good person.   Five sets of experiments in the current project test the idea that prosocial behavior can be increased if people are given the opportunity to use that behavior to signal their prosocial nature.  <br/><br/>In the proposed research the investigators test the effects of interventions designed based on signaling theory for their influence on prosocial behavior in a series of field and lab experiments. First, a field study in the context of a blood drive tests whether monetary incentives motivate blood donation more effectively when framed in a way that signals the pro-social motives of the decision maker to perform the behavior. Second, a study on framing messages to emphasize the signal value of vaccination examines whether parents of young children are more likely to receive an influenza vaccination for themselves after viewing a message presenting vaccination as a signal that one puts their children first than after seeing a message presenting vaccination as a signal that one puts self-care first, or after seeing either of two control messages. Third, in a study on peer recommendation, researchers will test whether a message advocating blood donation is more effective if it emphasizes the signal value of this behavior, and whether this signaling effect is more pronounced when the message comes in the form of a personalized recommendation from a co-worker as compared to a standard message from a blood drive. Fourth, three studies on social comparison will investigate whether feedback comparing one's performance to that of others promotes performance improvement in a pro-social task because the social comparison feedback serves as a signal, indicating what the performance says about the agent. Fifth, in a series of studies using a common pool resource game, researchers will explore the effect of a partitioning manipulation that signals the equitable amount for each agent to consume into order to achieve the group optimal outcome, and they will test whether the partition serves as a coordination signal. This research extends previous work in economics, social psychology, and decision research, and it applies signaling theory to the design of interventions to facilitate pro-social behavior. The body of research combines powerful field experiments with tightly controlled laboratory experimental designs to test the efficacy of signaling interventions by assessing actual behavior and examining the decision processes underlying these effects. The findings will simultaneously shed light on the nature of both pro-social behavior and signaling mechanisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Students enrolled in architecture, civil/construction engineering, and mechanical engineering courses will engage in four four-week units, and after each, will complete a collaborative assignment in interdisciplinary teams.

Therefore, a broader scope of understanding is needed to synthesize and use metal oxides for detecting a specific chemical at trace concentrations with no interference from other compounds in a complex mixture.  Within this project, the structure (rather than the composition) of an oxide is being correlated to its ability to detect a specific vapor of interest, whether it is a disease marker in breath or a harmful pollutant in the environment. The experiments being undertaken include novel synthesis of ceramic phases at the nanoscale, and atomic level characterization of gas-oxide interactions. Fundamental knowledge about how to produce tailored ceramic nanostructures with high specificity to the chemical vapors of interest is sought. This project is training scientists to use advanced materials processing and characterization techniques, and is educating the public at large about the benefits of ceramics research to human health and welfare. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: While semiconducting metal oxides have been used as resistive gas sensors commercially since 1968, the nature of gas-oxide interactions still remains unknown. These inherently polymorphic ceramics exist in various distinct crystallographic configurations, each behaving as a different material with respect to it?s physical and chemical properties, even though they all have the exact same composition. Nanoscale processing of ceramics has made available a ""toolbox"" of ""metastable phases"" at room temperature in high quantities. Sensing elements based on nanostructured binary metal oxides of controlled stoichiometry and phase distribution need to be studied in order to elucidate how gas selectivity is achieved. The underlying hypothesis is that phase distribution, rather than oxide composition, determines the gas sensing properties. Therefore, this study is synthesizing such controlled nanostructures, single crystal nanowires and nanopowders of both stable and metastable phases for common oxides used in sensing (MoO3, WO3, TiO2) by means of blend electrospinning, soft chemistry routes, and a rapid solidification process; and then carrying out detailed characterization studies on gas-oxide interactions, including in situ gas sensing experiments in an electron microscope. The physico-chemical changes occurring on the oxide surfaces in contact with a given gas (e.g., oxidation, reduction, ferroelectric poling) will be assessed for a selected group of oxide crystals (rutile, perovskite, etc.) and a respective set of classes of chemicals (such as amines and alkanes). The expected outcome from this project is a gas-oxide polymorph selection library for building the next generation of gas-sensing systems with inherent selectivity, to be used in health monitoring as non-invasive diagnostics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditional solutions reduce the cloud access latency by deploying servers at the network edge, but ignore the impact of mobile users' workload patterns on the efficiency of cloud operation. Instead, this project aims to design the edge cloud as a tree hierarchy of geo-distributed servers, so as to efficiently exploit the cloud resources for handling the peak load from mobile users. This research will benefit end users with various mobile devices by facilitating practical integration of these devices into the cloud. The results from this research are likely to foster new research directions on edge cloud design and mobile cloud computing.

For example, a hockey puck gliding across ice tends to keep moving in a straight line at constant speed unless a force acts on it. It is implicit in Newton's laws that you can always measure everything about the puck's motion, such as its position and its speed, without affecting the motion. It seems that the same should be true of any object, whether it is huge like the planet earth or tiny like an atom. However, this is not how nature works; very small objects, such as an atom or an electron, seem to obey a different set of rules, called quantum mechanics. Quantum mechanics predicts that strange things can happen, for example, an atom can have properties of being in two places at the same time, until its position is actually measured. As strange as those rules are, they make the electronics in computers and cell phones work, so we know they are accurate. Why don't hockey pucks have this strange quantum behavior? Interaction with other objects tends to hide the effects of quantum mechanics for objects much larger than atoms. The research team supported by this project will levitate a tiny diamond crystal in a chamber with almost no air remaining to minimize its interaction with other objects and stretch the size limits over which quantum mechanics does apply. The results of these experiments will improve our understanding of quantum mechanics, which is the foundation on which almost all our modern technology is based. <br/><br/>This program ultimately seeks to produce ""cat states"" in a mechanical system, where an object is in a quantum superposition of two different positions. This is a challenge which has puzzled physicists since the famous thought experiments of Schrodinger, 80 years ago. Researchers supported by this program will demonstrate that a trapped diamond nanocrystal containing nitrogen-vacancy (NV) defect centers is a nearly ideal platform for creating such motional quantum states. In particular, they will work towards demonstrating four critical capabilities of this system. First, the diamond nanocrystal must be trapped in vacuum with an ultra-high quality factor (Q). Second, it must be possible to manipulate and read out the spin state of the NV centers. Third, the NV center spin states must couple to the state of the mechanical motion. Last, the mechanical motion must be cooled to near the ground state to initialize the system to a known configuration. The experiments begin by loading a diamond nanocrystal into the trap. Next, the spin state of NV centers in the trapped nanodiamond will be read optically and manipulated with a microwave drive. Finally, the mechanical motion is coupled to the NV center spins through externally-imposed magnetic field gradients. The combination of the ultra high Q of the mechanical motion and quantum control of the NV centers makes trapped, NV-containing nanodiamonds a unique system for generating motional quantum states. The development of this system could be of great value in exploring the fundamental limits of quantum mechanics and the properties of novel motional quantum states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such inverse problems in potential theory have a rich history, but the mathematical tools needed to properly answer this question, especially in the case when the operator relating the force field to the mass distribution of the body is sensitive to long-range interactions, are currently underdeveloped.  In this project, the principal investigator will develop tools to further understand this problem, concentrating especially on what can be said if one knows only that the field has bounded magnitude.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project primarily concerns the relationship between the geometry of a measure and the regularity of an associated differential or singular integral operator.  This is is a question that has attracted mathematicians ever since the Cauchy and Riesz transforms were introduced as tools to study the behavior of analytic and harmonic functions, respectively.  An integrated approach to such problems is proposed that goes through the study of reflectionless measures.  This approach has recently yielded several new results and could potentially address a number of open problems, especially those concerning the smoothness of the support of a measure that has a bounded Riesz transform.  Here new tools in quantitative geometry and higher order partial differential equations need to be developed in order to make progress. Furthermore, the principal investigator seeks to build upon recent innovations in the theory of quasilinear differential equations to consider analogous problems for a wide range of nonlinear differential operators, where no integral representation is available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In line with this perspective, most laboratory research focused on rock failure has been limited to experiments utilizing slow loading rates. However, many natural processes that pose significant risk for humans (e.g., earthquakes and extraterrestrial impacts), as well as risks associated with human activities (explosions, mine failures, projectile penetration), occur at rates which are hundreds to thousands of time faster than typically simulated in the laboratory. As a result, little experimental data exists to confirm or calibrate theoretical models explaining the connection between these dramatic events and the pulverized rocks found in fault zones, impact, or explosion sites. Therefore, a combined experimental and field investigation is proposed to study brittle rock failure in both earthquake and impact environments.   The mechanical behavior of different rock types at fast loading rates is postulated to depend on the microscopic composition and structure of individual minerals within the rocks.  If true, this will allow scientists to better predict the consequences of earthquakes and impact events based on the rock structure in individual areas and furthermore allow engineers to design more effective structures to withstand the pressures in mining, petroleum and military environments.  Integrated into this research plan is a partnership with Teach for America (TFA), a national teacher corps of college graduates and professionals who commit to teach for two years and raise student achievement in public schools, to create the TFA Geocorps. The TFA Geocorps will be high-achieving secondary school teachers involved in summer research activities related to the project who will also work with the Principal Investigator to design Geophysics-based thematic curriculum units to teach in their own classrooms.  Graduate students supported by this project will supplement their academic training by taking active roles in collaborations with the participating TFA Geocorps teachers.  <br/><br/>Brittle damage accumulates in the earth?s crust via numerous processes ranging from very slow (fault creep) to very fast (extraterrestrial impact).  The strain-rate-dependent micromechanics of brittle damage formation in rocks, particularly under confinement, is poorly constrained, yet it is generally understood that rocks become stronger at higher strain rates, and that above a critical strain-rate threshold, failure in compression transitions from localized damage along discrete fractures to delocalized (distributed) fracture damage (i.e., fragmentation or pulverization).  A recent series of studies focused on pulverized rocks in fault damage zones provide evidence that ultra-high strain rates (>100/s) associated with rupture tip propagation and/or supershear earthquake rupture are responsible for this pulverization. The transition from discrete fracture to fragmentation depends on confinement (burial depth); and the mechanism, although poorly constrained, is likely controlled by the grain-scale structure of rocks and the dynamics of microcrack propagation.  Here it is proposed to characterize the high strain rate inelastic response of rocks by following an integrated field, experimental, and theoretical study focused on the strain rate dependence of fracture toughness, strain rate (and confinement) dependence of compressive strength and damage, and comparison with field observations to determine a microstructural signature of strain rate.  The proposed work is expected to calibrate damage mechanics models of high strain-rate rock failure, and to characterize damage zones formed in different strain rate (and confinement) regimes.  Expected results should provide a basis for distinguishing strain rate and stress conditions responsible for rock damage based on observing fracture networks and seismic anisotropy.   While the focus of this work will be on damage created during earthquakes and impacts, the strength and failure characteristics of rocks under high strain rates are also of fundamental interest in mining, petroleum, and military applications related to blasting, rock burst, underground explosions, and protective design."

To support commercial applications such as package delivery, it is imperative that the robotic systems operating in uncertain environments negotiate specific waypoints with prescribed tolerance. This unique challenge of routing the vehicles operating in uncertain environments involves a strong coupling between the uncertainty propagation and control. Successful negotiation of this challenge is contingent on the development of stable optimal feedback control laws, while accounting for the uncertainties that pervade dynamical systems. The fundamental formalisms that underpin this research are widely applicable to the control of next generation robotic systems and unmanned vehicles. The project includes plans to integrate research into educational efforts involving graduate and undergraduate students, including expanding efforts to reach under-represented populations in science and engineering. Outreach activities include the technical interchange meetings with local school teachers and instituting robotics related tutorial courses to motivate middle and high school students.<br/><br/>The focus of the research is to investigate a unified approach to stable optimal feedback control laws and uncertainty propagation methods by developing computationally efficient solutions to the Hamilton Jacobi Bellman (HJB) and Fokker-Planck-Kolmogorov (FPK) partial differential equations (PDEs), respectively. Recent advances in sparse approximation and non-product quadrature rules are exploited to solve the HJB and FPK equations. The intellectual merits are drawn from advancing the state of knowledge in uncertainty quantification, optimal control theory, and numerical analysis, and integrating them effectively to realize a scalable framework for study of dynamical systems. The Conjugate Unscented Transformation (CUT) technique in conjunction with sparse approximation methods forms an enabling tool to drive the uncertainty propagation and optimal feedback control realization processes. This research culminates in the development of nonlinear stable feedback control laws for uncertain dynamic systems, impacting various estimation and control problems in engineering.

The broader impacts of this research are two-fold: (1) Since managed languages are increasingly becoming economic linchpins, deployed in the engine rooms of global e-commerce platforms and Internet applications (including those of key software companies such as Amazon, Google, Facebook, Apple, Oracle, and Microsoft), improving the reliability and performance of these managed language platforms will lead to economic efficiencies as well as resource efficiencies in the form of reduced power costs to data centers and improved battery lifetime on mobile devices;(2) Concerning human diversity in the computing field, the research will engage undergraduates from under-represented groups, and encourage them to pursue graduate school and careers in computing and research.<br/><br/>This research project is defining, developing, evaluating, and refining the essential components of a new foundation layer for managed language implementation. In doing so, it addresses a key source of systemic inefficiency, by pioneering the ""micro virtual machine"" (microVM) as an efficient high-performance substrate for managed language implementation. The relationship between a microVM and existing managed language implementations is analogous to that between an operating system micro kernel and monolithic operating systems such as Linux. The microVM captures the insight that there exists a well-defined foundation common to most modern languages that can take responsibility for fundamental abstractions over hardware, concurrency, and memory. By isolating and exposing this substrate, the microVM embodies state-of-the-art base technology available to language implementers while isolating them from the pernicious complexities of these abstractions, freeing them to focus on all-important language-specific optimizations. The research is enabling more efficient software and a distinctly sharper focus for language implementation research and development. The intellectual merits of the research are: (1) Researching and identifying, via prototyping and evaluation, the right microVM abstractions, allowing clean separation of low-level language-neutral and high-level language-specific concerns, capturing the core behaviors, while also admitting high-performance language implementations; (2) Generating secondary research challenges, especially with regard to the effective and efficient combination of abstractions for hardware, concurrency, and memory; and (3) Creating a viable target for formal verification because the microVM has a relatively small code base, thus taking one step on the way towards trustworthy subsystems for assurance of managed software."

Because they are cooler, they could have many Earth-sized planets around them that have the means of hosting life. The investigators will combine observations from the Kepler spacecraft mission ""K2"", and from telescopes on the Earth, to make the largest-known sample of planets around M dwarf stars. They will measure the number and characteristics of planets that occur for different types of stars, and find and confirm planets that could host life as we understand it. These planets then become targets for future space telescopes such as the James Webb Space Telescope to study further in depth. This research serves the national interest by expanding our scientific knowledge about extrasolar planets that could host life.

These goals, however, remain mostly unrealized because past surveys have largely overlooked M dwarf stars in favor of solar-like stars. This research will support previous highly-successful surveys with the extended Kepler spacecraft mission K2, and key ground-based telescopic support facilities, to produce the largest known sample of planets around M stars. The investigators will measure planet occurrence frequency as a function of stellar and planetary properties; fill key gaps in formation models of low-mass systems; find potentially habitable planets; and find attractive targets for atmospheric characterization with the future James Webb Space Telescope. After K2 data are released, the investigators will extract photometry, identify and validate planet candidates. They then acquire follow-up imaging and spectroscopy to identify false positives, classify stars, and validate planets. The combination of K2 light curves, reconnaissance spectra, and radial velocity data determine precise stellar and planetary parameters. Finally, a global synthesis of all data measures the survey completeness and global occurrence rate of planets around M dwarf stars, including the frequency of habitable, rocky planets.

While Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs), being reconfigurable, are a natural platform for implementing such devices, it is becoming more and more difficult for traditional FPGAs to keep up with the ever-increasing scale and complexity of self-adaptive applications due to the limited scalability, high leakage power, and severe process variations of CMOS technologies. A set of prior research projects demonstrated that it is technically feasible to construct FPGAs based on non-volatile memories (NVMs). These NV-FPGAs offer attractive features such as better scalability, superior energy efficiency, near-zero power-on delay, anti-radiation, as well as the ability to store more than one bit per cell. However, NV-FPGAs also display a complex design space involving information density, read and write speeds, data retention time, and device endurance. When used for self-adaptive systems, the distinctive NVM characteristics may influence reconfiguration speed, clock frequency, circuit functionality, memory performance, and/or device lifetime.<br/><br/>This project addresses this technology gap as it prepares NV-FPGAs for more demanding self-adaptive systems. This project aims to fine-tune various procedures on the FPGA synthesis flow based on NVM characteristics, so as to exploit their advantages and mitigate their shortcomings. First, considering the needs of self-adaptive applications, this project fine-tunes various steps on the FPGA synthesis flow. Novel techniques are proposed to optimize task scheduling, data allocation, logic mapping, placement, and routing to improve reconfiguration speed, energy efficiency, reliability, and endurance of NVM FPGAs. Second, this project explores the rich NVM design space and sets different optimization goals for look-up tables, flip-flops, and on-chip memories. The success of this project will lead to a long-lasting, rapid-adaptive, reliable, and energy-efficient platform better suited to the needs of a wide range of applications with self-adaptivity requirement, including healthcare, wellness, industry, and even military applications, all of which are critical for the United States to drive its new strategies of innovation and technology. It will also train a diverse type of engineers to design the future generation of embedded and cyber-physical systems with the cutting-edge technology of non-volatile memories. Algorithms and tools developed in this project will be made publicly available so that they will benefit the entire scientific community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A well-chosen design facilitates the collection of data that, at a minimum cost, maximizes the information for the scientific questions of interest.  Many scientific studies allow for repeated use of conceptual units, so that developing tools for optimal design for these problems has great potential impact.  Particularly in the realm of big data, there is much room for improvement of existing methods for design of experiments, and the tools and concepts under development in this research project have potential to lead to significant gain of information without increasing computational cost.  Results from the project will be made available to researchers in other areas through easy-to-use software that implements the algorithms to be developed. Graduate students will be trained to become researchers in design of experiments. <br/><br/>This project aims to result in a major leap forward in understanding and knowledge of optimal design of experiments. Recent work in the field has had a significant impact on the advancement of optimal crossover designs and designs for interference models for arbitrarily given covariance structures and design size configurations. However, these results have for the most part been limited to approximate designs for relatively simple models. While these results are arguably important in their own right, this project will extend methods and tools to achieve the ultimate goal of deriving exact designs for a wider spectrum of practical models. The results will be a much needed addition to our collective design toolbox. Most importantly, this project will go beyond the territory of design and apply the tools and ideas from design of experiments to subsampling problems emerging in big data with both statistical and machine learning methods under consideration. Preliminary results indicate that this is an opportune time to make these challenging but critical steps."

The project will provide estimates of opinion in districts with little or no survey data, such as state legislative districts. The project's intellectual merit comes from establishing a new means for measuring public opinion that not only uses survey respondents' answers to polling questions but also incorporates important information about where respondents are located and what that implies about geographic patterns in public opinion. Coupled with population information from the U.S. Census, the project will produce stronger estimates of public sentiment when survey data are sparsely distributed.  The investigators will release free software that includes user-friendly functions allowing any citizen to determine public opinion in his or her own district or in districts that have not yet cast any votes, such as proposed congressional districts in a redistricting cycle.  The software will allow more sophisticated users to obtain measures for any variable (even if unrelated to public opinion) in relationship to geographic boundaries, which will have extensions to research in public health, epidemiology, economics, sociology, business, and law. The broader impact to society will be that the data and software from this project will provide more information for the news media, the public, and elected officials regarding the outlook of the nation by constituency and locale, thereby providing a better understanding of the American representation process. The project will recruit a diverse group of research assistants that will be trained in this kind of statistical analysis.<br/><br/>Studies relating to public opinion often settle for less-than-ideal data. Frequently, researchers will measure public opinion in the 50 states or the 435 congressional districts by pooling together several surveys taken over time (losing a sense of change over time), using old measures of public opinion (which may not be consistent with current public views), or using presidential vote share to approximate public sentiment (which is prone to error because factors besides ideology affect vote choices). With smaller districts than these, such as state legislative districts, the problem is magnified considerably, because it is rare to have many survey respondents in such a small area. In this project, the investigators ask: How can survey responses and the geographic location of the respondents be used to reliably forecast constituency public opinion? To answer this question, the investigators will use the method of Bayesian universal kriging. This technique fits a training model over survey data to determine how demographic factors shape public opinion and how the portion of survey responses that cannot be explained by demographics can be explained by a geographically smoothed process. With a model like this, public opinion in constituencies can be predicted with known population demographics and the values of the geographically smoothed error process over that district.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is a very active field, since many questions in other fields can be represented mathematically as matrix problems. For example: the spectra of heavy atoms in physics, statistical estimation of covariance matrices in statistics, capacity of quantum channels in quantum communication, conducting properties of semiconductors (Anderson models). This project aims to study the basic properties of some random matrix ensembles, which will shed some light on the nature of the highly correlated many-body system. In particular, for understanding the conducting properties of semiconductors and other disordered systems, as explained by the Anderson model in quantum physics, one main project in this research program is designed to provide rigorous proof that similar (conducting) property appears in the random matrix models. There are some problems in this program designed for training graduate and undergraduate students who have an interest in probability theory. The investigator will also run workshops designed to foster the upward professional development of graduate and undergraduate students working in fields related to random matrix theory as well as to stimulate interaction across barriers between these disciplines.  <br/><br/>The investigator will focus on the identification of the eigenvalue densities, the local eigenvalue statistics and the  eigenvector distributions of  many different classes of random matrix ensembles. The ensembles considered in this project include anisotropic  matrices, band matrices, i.i.d. random matrices, and general non-Hermitian matrices. One main project will be focused on the localization-delocalization conjecture of random band matrices, which is very similar to the metal-insulator phase transition for disordered quantum systems (i.e., the so called Anderson conjecture in quantum physics). Different from regular Wigner matrices, random band matrices are not a mean-field type ensemble. Hence this ensemble is more like the realistic models of quantum many-body systems, which involve quantum states with more geometric structure. Another main project is a study of non-Hermitian matrices (e.g., i.i.d. random matrices). The study on this type of ensembles is much weaker than the study on random Hermitian matrices, since the regular spectrum method can not be applied. The investigator will apply some new ideas on these type of matrices. In this proposal, some projects are also designed for training graduate and undergraduate students, which include proving the universality phenomenon for more general random matrix ensembles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The abundance of DNA sequence data arising from genome sequencing projects has led to important computational challenges in the estimation of these phylogenetic relationships. Among these challenges is the estimation of the evolutionary history for a group of species based on DNA sequence information from several distinct genes sampled throughout the genome. This research is focused on the development of computationally efficient methods for estimating the evolutionary history when the number of species under consideration is very large (i.e., hundreds to thousands). This is accomplished by considering collections of three species at a time, and using properties of the estimated evolutionary history for groups of three to infer the overall evolutionary history. Properties and performance of the method will be evaluated theoretically as well as with both simulated and empirical data sets. This work has numerous practical applications, such as the study of the evolutionary relationships among human populations.<br/><br/>Though the amount of genomic data available for inferring phylogenetic species trees has increased rapidly within the last 10 years, few methods have been developed to efficiently estimate species trees for data sets consisting of hundreds or thousands of species. A fast approximation to the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) that retains desirable statistical properties, such as consistency and asymptotic efficiency, is proposed. Results from preliminary work suggest that this approach will be significantly faster than existing likelihood and Bayesian approaches, while also being highly accurate. The method can be applied to a range of data types, including allele frequency data arising under a Brownian motion model along the phylogeny and single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data arising from the coalescent model. A software package will be developed to implement the methodology. The project will also support one PhD student, who will contribute to the development and implementation of the methodology."

Cyberlearning Exploration (EXP) Projects explore the viability of new kinds of learning technologies by designing and building new kinds of learning technologies and studying their possibilities for fostering learning and challenges to using them effectively. So-called 'non-cognitive' factors such as grit, tenacity, and perseverance have drawn renewed attention from researchers, policy makers, and the public. Cutting across all three concepts is the fundamental idea of 'self-regulation,' or the ability to monitor and appropriately regulate one's attention. Self-regulation skills are critical for success in today's era of rapid technological and social change. Luckily, evidence is accumulating that such skills can be taught. New technologies for collecting, tracking, and reporting data offer great promise for developing and scaffolding students' ability to self-regulate. One such tool is the touch tablet application entitled Tenacity. Tenacity is a tablet based application for middle schoolers designed to train and track the user's attentional self-regulation. Prior research found that, after using the tool for roughly 20 minutes per day for a period of two weeks, students showed significant improvements in self-regulation skills. In this project, researchers will adapt the existing prototype application for more accessible use on wearable devices, add a data dashboard for monitoring one's skill development over time, and then assess its use and effectiveness in the natural environment both inside and outside the classroom. The results will be a market ready application for wearable technologies (smart watches) for self-regulating attention, empirical results assessing its use and impact among everyday users, and the public release on iTunes of the software for dissemination and assessment at mass scale. <br/><br/>Specifically, the research team will adapt the current prototype for use on the Apple iWatch, debug and polish its ability to train and track breath-counting accuracy intermittently throughout the day, and implement data visualization tools for use by users and their parents and teachers. They will then assess its effectiveness in an 8-week experimental study using a pretest/posttest control group design with teens (13-15 years old). Finally, they will release the tool to the public via the Apple App Store to examine its use and effectiveness at mass scale. The hypothesis is that systematic use of Tenacity will result in behavior change on standard measures for attention, foster a more productive conceptual understanding of self-regulation, increase self-regulation skills on first order tasks (i.e., direct skill improvement measures within the application) and second order variables, such as school grades and social wellbeing, and increase school affiliation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
