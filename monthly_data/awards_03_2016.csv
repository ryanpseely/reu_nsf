This information will be used to predict how birds will respond to future changes in climate and habitat, enabling better conservation planning. Researchers will make use of a unique historic resource: systematic surveys of birds conducted in every major ecological region of California from 1900 to 1945. These surveys were conducted at sites that have since experienced changes in climate, agricultural development, and urbanization. Thirty sites in the Los Angeles area will be re-surveyed.  The resulting data will be added to a dataset of 290 sites already re-surveyed in the Sierra Nevada, Coast Ranges, Central Valley, and Mojave Desert. Measures of how birds have responded to changes at each site will be used to predict future responses to climate and land use change. This study will enhance our understanding of how combined changes in climate and land use impact birds. Specifically, it will test whether changes in land use exacerbate problems from climate change or help some birds to live in places they would have otherwise avoided. This project is important for conservation planning and will provide training and mentoring of two students.<br/><br/>This study will use a unique historical resource (early 20th century bird surveys conducted by Joseph Grinnell and colleagues) in conjunction with contemporary resurveys to quantify how the effects of climate and land-use change have altered bird distributions in California. These measures will be used to project bird distributions under future scenarios of climate and land-use change. Re-surveys have already been completed at 30 sites in the agriculturally-developed Central Valley, and 260 relatively protected sites in the Sierra Nevada, Coast Ranges, and Mojave Desert. This project will re-resurvey an additional 30 sites in the Los Angeles area, providing a measure of how birds have responded to greater warming and urbanization than is represented in the current dataset. By quantifying how changes in bird occupancy over the past century are driven by climate and land-use covariates, this study will then project bird responses to future scenarios of climate and land-use change based on direct measures of temporal change. Projections will be used to explore which groups of birds are expected to experience range expansions or contractions in the future, and whether this will result in the creation of no-analog bird communities."

Oceanic island formation, evolution, and sustainability are unifying themes that a group of 10 undergraduate students will explore during an exciting 9-week program.  The Hawaiian Islands, being of volcanic origin, are windows into the Earth's interior. Built by magma that has ascended roughly a hundred kilometers to reach the surface, the volcanoes subsequently experience deformation, erosion, flank collapse and eventually sink below sea level.  Oceanic islands are also sites of intense biological evolution and are ecological niches in a vast ocean.  The University of Hawaii is uniquely positioned to take advantage of these phenomena and our new program will provide cutting-edge STEM research opportunities for motivated undergraduate students, in particular traditionally underrepresented groups such as Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders, as well as students enrolled at undergraduate institutions that provide few opportunities to participate in cutting-edge research. During the first week, students will engage in a series of introductory, daylong crash-courses on quantitative analysis and modeling tools, which will enhance their abilities to conduct research. During the next eight weeks, students will work along-side individual world-class scientists (host mentors) who will guide the student through a modest yet challenging research project during an eight-week intense collaboration.<br/><br/>Following the core theme of Earth science on volcanic islands, the student activities are expected to contribute to various fields of research, but more importantly, to engage motivated undergraduate students in the process of doing science and to energize them for future study in STEM-related endeavors.  The research goal of this REU is to advance the knowledge of the formation, evolution, and sustainability of ocean islands. Specifically, we will examine the growth and subsequent deformation of volcanic islands using state-of-the-art tools and methodology from petrology, geochemistry, volcanology, structural geology, seismology, and geophysics.  We will also study the hydrologic pathways for subaerial and submarine groundwater flow using geochemical tracers, as well as the biogeochemistry of marine organisms thriving in the proximity of volcanic islands."

Effective design requires quickly bringing diverse expertise to bear on each iteration of the design. These two goals -- faster design cycles and better cross-disciplinary integration -- are enabled by model-based concurrent design approaches. These approaches bring multiple experts together into a single room to create a design in a series of short design sessions, and they are widely used in certain fields, such as spacecraft design. These approaches have many proven advantages, but also potentially serious drawbacks due to the level of decomposition they impose on the design problem. For example, many assumptions are made in order to decompose the design tasks into modules for each team member, and these assumptions may not be valid for all design problems. This award supports fundamental research to generate knowledge about how the ""fit"" between the technical decomposition (the problem being solved) and the organizational decomposition (people and tasks) impacts the quality of the design process. The results will enable design organizations to make better informed choices about how to deploy concurrent design approaches, such as when these tools apply and when they do not, and how to use them well even when the technical and organizational decompositions are slightly mismatched. The resultant gains in design efficiency would have implications for many sectors of the economy that depend on engineering design and innovation. In addition, this research involves several disciplines including aerospace and systems engineering, organization design, and qualitative research methods; this approach will foster multi-disciplinary research and engineering education.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to generate knowledge about how the lack of ""fit"" between a design organization's imposed decomposition and the problem's natural decomposition affect the speed and characteristics of the design process. The research will focus on understanding the nature of ""fit,"" developing a framework for measuring it, identifying the types of problems that arise in the design process due to this lack of ""fit,"" and explaining the mechanisms by which they arise. Current research in this area is limited by measurement challenges and limited empirical evidence. This research will address these limitations through an empirical study of the concurrent design team at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration's Jet Propulsion Laboratory. The research will be conducted through an in-depth observational process study of multiple concurrent design sessions. The design process will be observed, its key characteristics measured, and the technical and organizational decompositions will be recorded, so that the impact of the decompositions' ""fit"" on the design process characteristics can be evaluated and its drivers explained."

In addition to scholarships, the program will provide academic and other support to increase the persistence of academically talented, low-income students.  Project efforts focus extensively on sophomores to facilitate transition to upper-level science coursework. The project has identified the sophomore year as a time when many capable students leave science majors. The results of this project will be applicable to other institutions seeking to increase retention of second-year science students. Scholarships and support for academically strong students, who may not otherwise be able to afford college, will help to produce a well-trained workforce that will contribute to the economic vitality of California and the nation.<br/><br/>Progress has been made in identifying some of the factors which can help improve the success of undergraduate science students in the first year.  However, a challenge remains as a significant percentage of students do not persist in science majors beyond the end of their sophomore year. This project will focus on sophomores to facilitate upper division continuation at a time when many students leave science majors. The scholarships will decrease the need for low-income students to work part-time and thus increase their opportunities to be involved in second year undergraduate research and internships with industry. The academic support will include curricular and co-curricular activities such as research methodology, peer mentoring and career exploration workshops. The project will eliminate or reduce the need for low-income students to work part-time and increase students' aspirations towards further participation in STEM research and internship experiences.  An additional emphasis will be on talented students who begin in precalculus. These students were found to have lower graduation rates in STEM compared to students who are ready to take calculus in the first year.  Lower graduation rates are due in part to a need to pay extra tuition to catch up in mathematics and science courses the summer after the first year. By focusing on a time that is particularly important for undergraduate persistence in STEM and on a particular sample of students who have an even less likelihood of persisting, this program hopes to positively impact the trajectory of talented low-income students typically underrepresented in STEM fields. The findings from the program will be disseminated widely to the STEM education community and help increase understanding of the attributes and practices of successful student scholarship and support programs."

Such storms can cause significant direct and indirect losses incurred by communities each year. Wind storm damage mitigation can be achieved by providing an alternative to current design practice through the introduction of loss estimation methodologies for wind-excited buildings that fully embrace the principles of modern performance-based design (PBD). PBD may not only provide new tools that can advance design practices from the limitations of prescriptive codes, but may also enable the rational and holistic performance assessment of a wide class of existing and new buildings under winds through performance metrics that directly promote community resiliency.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a state-of-the-art holistic PBD framework for a wide class of low- to mid-rise buildings sensitive to wind. The framework will focus on the rational determination of the direct and indirect losses caused, for example, by damages sustained to the cladding, internal partitions and ceilings due to water ingress, and debris impact and excessive net pressure acting on the building envelope, as well as damages and losses due to excessive drift or acceleration of the main wind force resisting system of the building. Performance will be expressed through a concise set of system-level decision variables, e.g., expected system-level annual repair costs and downtime that are easily understood by decision-makers and/or stakeholders of diverse technical backgrounds. The framework will be initiated by time-dependent extratropical storm and hurricane models that will include the effects of uncertainties. In order to consistently describe the damages and losses outlined above, specific models will be developed for rigorously describing pressure-induced damage to building envelopes through the use of wind tunnel measured pressure databases. These models will be complemented through the definition of probabilistic models for describing water-induced internal damage and losses, as well as building envelope damage and losses due to excessive pressure and debris impact. The integration of these models can lead to a design framework that will enable a new generation of safer and more economic buildings subject to wind hazards."

In the past, structural engineers have focused their attention on creating stronger, more ductile, more reliable lateral-resistance systems that can be used within the walls of buildings to resist the extreme demands associated with these natural hazards. Comparatively little attention has been paid to the role of the floor systems of buildings in resisting these demands. The floor diaphragm acts as a critical element that distributes the demands developed in a building during an extreme event to the lateral-resistance systems and eventually to the building foundation. Steel deck, i.e., thin corrugated steel panels typically with concrete fill, forms one of the most commonly used diaphragm elements in multi-story steel buildings. This project has as its objectives: to develop fundamental understanding of steel deck diaphragms as structural systems integrated within the overall building performance, to develop improved strategies for accurate modeling of floor systems within three-dimensional building models, and to develop new solutions for steel deck diaphragms that enhance the overall structural resilience of buildings.<br/><br/>Current lack of knowledge about floor diaphragm systems impedes a needed evolution for building design approaches from focusing on two-dimensional frame design to enabling creative solutions within three-dimensional building design. The utilization of the diaphragm as an energy dissipating system has not been harnessed nor optimized in buildings. This project will develop a series of building archetypes appropriate to steel deck diaphragms. An integrated experimental program will be conducted at the connection and diaphragm scale, including novel non-contact measurement schemes for revealing damage and deformations during testing, to bridge critical knowledge gaps that currently impede three-dimensional modeling and design of buildings. To explore new solutions for energy-dissipating diaphragms, this project will perform testing of structural fuses and develop prototypes for integrating these fuses into steel diaphragm systems. This project will also complete high fidelity material and geometric nonlinear finite element models to enable detailed investigations of the flow of forces in diaphragms and between the diaphragm and all connected components. A series of lower fidelity, reduced order models will be developed, appropriate for whole building analysis of selected building archetypes. Formal optimization of the role of the diaphragm in building response, including a novel two-level optimization scheme, will be performed. Taken together, these activities will provide a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art for design of building diaphragms. Through a comprehensive outreach effort with industry, the findings will be transferred to engineers and utilized to improve the structural resilience of the nation's buildings."

Many applications of data analysis across science, engineering, and business can be viewed as taking a matrix of observations and fitting low-rank or otherwise structured matrices to explain their relationships. Image and video analysis is not the only example; the problem arises in structural analysis of social networks, divining user preferences for new products and services, and many other analysis tasks. <br/><br/>As the scale and dimensionality of these problems increases, the data analyst is faced with a gap between rigor and scale: theoretically sound algorithms often have requirements (e.g. repeated/random access to data) that are feasible only on medium-scale datasets, and even then may not provide answers in ""interactive time"" (i.e. smallish time scales required for a human interactively analyzing data). Thus practice has turned towards methods that lack rigorous guarantees, but that are scalable and have been observed to provide decent approximation.<br/><br/> This project aims to narrow this gap by two technical observations: <br/>(a) Recognizing that fast matrix inference necessitates non-convex algorithms, it focuses on developing a rigorous analysis of the same, and  <br/>(b) by explicitly incorporating big-data architectures (out of core, and distributed multicore) in the algorithm design and statistical analysis stage itself. it focuses on several specific tasks, including pass-efficient low-rank approximation, minimizing general convex functions over the non-convex set of low-rank matrices, robust matrix estimation, and non-linear and kernel matrix settings. <br/><br/><br/>The project trains graduate students in the mathematical and computational development important for data analysis.

Within the phytoplankton, the diatoms conduct nearly half of this photosynthesis, exerting profound control over global carbon cycling. Despite their importance, there are surprisingly fundamental gaps in understanding how diatoms function in their natural environment, in part because methods to assess in situ physiology are lacking. This project focuses on the application of a powerful new approach, called Quantitative Metabolic Fingerprinting (QMF), to address this knowledge gap and examine species-specific physiology in the field. The project will provide transformative insights into how ocean geochemistry controls the distribution of diatoms, the metabolic responses of individual diatom species, and how metabolic potential is partitioned between diatom species, thus providing new insights into the structure and function of marine systems. The overarching goal is to examine how diatom species respond to changes in biogeochemistry across marine provinces, from the coast to the open ocean, by following shifts in diatom physiology using QMF. This research is critical to understand future changes in oceanic phytoplankton in response to climate and environmental change. Furthermore, activities on this project will include supporting a graduate student and postdoctoral fellow and delivering the Artistic Oceanographer Program (AOP) to diverse middle school age children and teachers in the NYC metropolitan area and to middle-school girls in the Girl Scouts of RI, reaching an anticipated 60 children and 30 teachers annually. The programs will foster multidisciplinary hands-on learning and will directly impact STEM education at a critical point in the pipeline by targeting diverse middle-school aged groups in both NY and RI.<br/><br/>In laboratory studies with cultured isolates, there are profound differences among diatom species' responses to nutrient limitation. Thus, it is likely that different species contribute differently to nutrient uptake, carbon flux and burial. However, marine ecosystem models often rely on physiological attributes drawn from just one species and apply those attributes globally (e.g. coastal species used to model open ocean dynamics) or choose a single average value to represent all species across the world's oceans. In part, this is due to a relatively poor understanding of diatom physiological ecology and a limited tool set for assessing in situ diatom physiological ecology. This research project will address this specific challenge by explicitly tracking metabolic pathways, measuring their regulation and determining their taxonomic distribution in a suite of environmentally significant diatoms using a state of the art, species-specific approach.  A research expedition is set in the North Atlantic, a system that plays a major role in carbon cycling. Starting with a New England coastal shelf site, samples will be collected from the coast where diatoms thrive, to the open ocean and a site of a long term ocean time series station (the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series) where diatom growth is muted by nutrient limitation. This research takes advantage of new ocean observatories initiative (OOI) and time series information. Through the research expedition and downstream laboratory experiments, the molecular pathways of nutrient metabolism and related gene expression in a suite of environmentally significant diatoms will be identified. Data will be combined to predict major limiting factors and potentially important substrates for diatoms across marine provinces. Importantly, this integrated approach takes advantage of new advances in molecular and bioinformatics tools to examine in situ physiological ecology at the species-specific level, a key knowledge gap in the field."

This project at Galveston College (GC), a two-year Hispanic-serving community and technical college, is designed to advance desired societal outcomes through increased gainful employment for graduates and economic growth of employers.  The goal is to revamp the existing Electrical and Electronics (E/E) Program into an advanced E/E and Instrumentation Program (INT) that will produce highly qualified technicians able to meet current and future workforce demands while substantially increasing the employability of technical graduates from the college program. The disciplinary focus of the project is Engineering Technology with an emphasis on Electronics Technology. Project partners are members of the college Industry and Business Implementation Team (IBIT) and include government agencies, businesses, and industries such as Marathon Petroleum Corporation, Landrys Corporation, Pyramid Instrumentation, SpawGlass, City Electric, Economic Development Division of County of Galveston, and Galveston Independent School District. These partners typify stakeholders providing almost 3000 new E/E & INT job opportunities within the next few years. The project will broaden opportunities for GC technician students, the majority who are from groups typically underrepresented in STEM technician fields, by supporting the social and financial investment needed to stimulate industry-academic partnerships and develop curriculum based on documented workforce needs. <br/><br/> The project will advance knowledge and understanding within community colleges of technician education by developing a revised Integrated Curriculum Framework for Technician Education (ICF-TE). The ICF-TE, adaptable to other technician education programs, will build industry-academic partnerships that result in increased interactions between students and employers, increased employability, and improvements in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) technician teaching and learning. It will adapt known strategies to support recruitment, retention, and completion of students; and create articulation agreements with area secondary schools. Critical components of the ICF-TE were established in coordination with the IBIT who will continue to assist with implementation and outreach. These critical components of the ICF-TE include: (1) industry recognized stacked certifications, (2) problem-based teaching and learning, (3) advanced technician skills training through progressive (stacked) modules, (4) work ethics curriculum, and (5) practical training with real-world work experiences. IBIT members will interact directly with students by providing opportunities for employment, supervision, mentoring, and instruction. The primary project focus is on the E/E Associate of Applied Science (AAS) degree and certificate students and associated faculty and administration. Secondary audiences are future STEM technician students recruited from area high schools and current workers seeking to advance their technician skills.

It would be time-consuming for users to access important meeting output by reading the full transcripts. Consequently, automatically generated meeting summaries is of great value to people and businesses alike by providing quick access to the essential content of past meetings. The core objective of this research project is to automatically generate abstract-style focused meeting summaries to help users digest the vast amount of meeting content in an easy manner. It helps the research community to better understand the characteristics of the meeting domain, define the summarization task in meetings in a more consistent way, improve speech summarization evaluation metrics, and allow the wide use of speech summarization techniques in many applications (such as generating meeting minutes or lecture outlines). The broader impacts of this project includes sharing insights on conversational text with social scientists, providing natural language processing research training to students, and contributing effective methods for meeting summarization to the general public.<br/><br/>This research project aims at constructing abstractive summaries of meetings by developing computational models for important outcome identification and natural language summary generation, as well as designing objective summary evaluation methods. Existing meeting summarization systems remain largely extractive: Their summaries are comprised exclusively of patchworks of utterances selected directly from the meetings to be summarized. Although relatively easy to construct, extractive approaches simply present a set of utterances as the final summary, and fall short of producing concise and readable summaries, largely due to the spontaneous nature of spoken dialogue. This project formulates a new framework that accounts for the special aspects of meetings and use them to identify the utterances that contain important outcomes. A discriminative learning-based latent variable model trained with rich features is utilized to jointly capture topic shifting and extract utterances with important outputs. To perform sentence planning and surface realization in one single process, a neural network-based natural language generation model is developed. Objective evaluation methods are designed to measure various aspects for the quality of generated summaries."

They coat windows to keep our homes cool and energy efficient, enable the integrated circuits in electronic devices and appliances, allow for turbine engines to run more fuel efficiently, and are the basis of countless other products. However, their use is limited by the fact that the processing conditions for creating one film are often incompatible with those needed to make others, or even to deposit them on certain types of materials. This issue is problematic because thin films are extremely fragile, and thus far it has generally not been possible to remove them from one substrate and transfer them to another without tearing them apart. This research program will establish how to control crack growth in ultrathin films, so that they can be adhered to other materials after their production. This work will enable new materials to be fabricated and existing ones to be integrated to create a new generation of products and devices. These new scientific insights will be developed in concert with the education of graduate students, who will be prepared to use them to solve critical industrial and societal problems.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Ultrathin (< 100 nm) metal films have a variety of applications, but their use is limited by the fact that freestanding metallic films are prone to crack and tear. As a result, they generally cannot survive handling and assembly unless they are on substrates. However, if freestanding, ultrathin  metal films could be fabricated and handled without damaging them, their nanoenabled optical, mechanical, and electrical properties could be integrated with materials that are usually considered incompatible. This new capability would lead to a richer use of the special properties of these films. This research program will enable the integration of these ultrathin metal films by using laser micromachining, small-scale mechanical testing systems, electron microscopy, and finite element modeling to establish the subcritical crack growth mechanisms of freestanding ultrathin Au films. A unique feature of this program is that large sheets (> 5 mm in-plane extent) are used to evaluate the anomalously large process zones that  micrometer-scale specimens cannot capture. Experiments will be conducted on low force mechanical testing systems equipped with in situ optical systems to quantify deformation and damage accumulation. The relevant damage accumulation mechanisms will be identified using optical, scanning electron, and transmission electron microscopy.  Guided by these insights, heat treatments and near-monolayer thickness metal layers will be used to engineer the tearing resistance of the ultrathin films. Furthermore, the development of thin sheet tearing crack tip parameters will enable fracture mechanics-based durability and life calculations. The resulting ability to engineer damage-tolerant freestanding metal films will allow engineers to create devices from virtually any metallic thin film material."

In such complex systems, many interacting subsystems are often independently designed, managed and engineered. This ""design-by-subsystem"" approach reduces the cost and complexity of the design process, but prevents the discovery of unexpected, emergent interactions between subsystems until the system is integrated and tested in operation. This award explores new methods of failure analysis for complex engineered systems by focusing on how the failure modes depend on the connections between subsystems and the variables and parameters governing the physics-based behaviors of those subsystems. While in previous research network models of complex engineered systems have been introduced to address this issue, the fundamental limitation remains the exclusive reliance on physical and functional dependencies between components. This research aims to produce a set of indicators to assist engineers in quantifying the failure tolerance of complex engineered systems without going through the expense of a complete system simulation, which in many cases is neither feasible nor practical.  <br/><br/>This project specifically introduces a new approach to robust design based on failure tolerance of interdependent networks.  The approach explicitly addresses both physical architecture and behavioral, physics-based relations as contributing to the system's tolerance to failure. The methodology incorporates a mesoscale property of complex networks, namely modularity, to understand how the architecture of components and their physics-based relations have an important function of creating stability and failure tolerance. The project will first introduce a new conceptualization of robust design based upon the relational stability between design elements. This represents an important conceptual shift in thinking about robust design, moving away from component reliability alone towards consideration of the connectivity of the behavior of parts. The project will then introduce a network-based methodology and simulation environment capable of calculating the robustness of a complex engineered system. A set of measures will be introduced, which, while being single quantities, holistically capture the failure behavior of the complex engineered system not just at phase transition between nominal behavior and failure but before and after that as well."

Structural information on proteins and how proteins interact is essential for understanding the effects of genetic variation on the function of cells. Because of all the large DNA sequencing projects, we have huge amounts of information on DNA changes that lead to changes in the building blocks of proteins (the amino acids) for all types of organisms, but understanding how this affects protein and cell function is much farther behind. This project will provide new and improved methods for determining how proteins are folded, and how they interact with other proteins, which affects how cells behave. This research will allow researchers to connect structural properties of all the proteins occurring in a single organism to changes in appearance, behavior, and responses to the environment of that organism. By publishing the results through Web-available databases the total effect on the organism from the structural and interaction changes will be available to other researchers and the public. The long-term research goals are to understand the molecular properties that drive life processes, and to choose changes that will result in making the intended product having the expected function in biotechnology applications.

Approaches will be developed to discriminate non-interacting from interacting proteins, and to model the structures of protein-protein complexes, based on similarity to experimentally determined protein-protein complexes and on properties of the intermolecular energy landscape. A novel approach to fold detection will extend the number of proteins that can be modeled. A pipeline will be developed to integrate protein structure prediction with the prediction of protein complexes, and use structure-based approaches to predict the effects of SAVs.

This project will develop a record of when speleothems grew in Arctic caves and, consequently, under what past climatic conditions continuous permafrost thawed. The principal investigators will develop a website designed to educate lay audiences on how speleothems are used to study past climate. They will participate in the Cambridge Science Festivals?

Speleothems require liquid water to grow and thus imply thawed ground conditions when they were deposited. This work will take advantage of advances in uranium-thorium geochronology and use existing speleothem collections from three remote areas of Canada, spanning 17° of latitude and range from isolated to continuous permafrost zones to document the extent of speleothem growth, and thus permafrost thaw, across variable interglacial conditions of the past 600 kyr some of which were warmer than today. They will also apply uranium-lead dating to a selection of samples to extend the dating range to millions of years. Well-dated, high-resolution records of terrestrial paleoclimate are also rare in the Arctic, though critical for understanding the response of this region to radiative forcings and determining the climate forcing that drove past changes in ice sheets, permafrost, sea ice, and vegetation. Therefore, they will measure stable isotope records along the speleothems to reconstruct climate variability over the intervals during which they grew. While likely fragmentary and confined to warm periods, these records will essentially provide underground extensions of the Greenland ice core ?18O record to numerous past interglacial periods."

Users increasingly rely on social media to disclose serious real-life incidents, such as a food poisoning incident at a restaurant, rather than visiting official communication channels. This valuable user-generated information, if identified reliably, may have a dramatic positive impact on critical applications related to public health -- the family of applications of interest in this project -- and beyond. For example, a local health department might launch an investigation of a potential foodborne disease outbreak at a restaurant if compelling evidence supporting the investigation can be inferred from social media. This project will address fundamental research challenges associated with processing social media to produce actionable inferences, where the output of the process leads to concrete actions in the real world. In addition to producing broadly applicable research results, the project will have as its centerpiece a critical public health application, namely, detecting and acting on foodborne disease outbreaks in restaurants.<br/><br/>Overall, this project will develop (1) strategies for entity-centric modeling and selection of social media, to cover the vast volumes of user-produced content across sources; (2) non-traditional information extraction strategies over informal, noisy, and ungrammatical text, as well as learning-based approaches to produce actionable, entity-centric inferences for public health applications; and (3) methods for general online active learning and search that are tuned for detecting the rare and infrequent occurrences required for actionable inferences.

Their findings extend our understanding of the universe, and inspire the next generation of scientists. The process of parameter estimation requires that the observed wave be compared to many millions of gravitational waves generated by theoretical models. However, this poses a major challenge: the software currently used for this task is far too slow, requiring up to 1,000 years to estimate parameters for a single detected gravitational wave. This grant will support an effort to improve this software platform performance by a factor of 10,000, which will greatly increase the usefulness of this state-of-the-art and widely-used model for LSC parameter estimation. The grant will also support the implementation of an automated software validation system for the LSC, to prevent certain types of software ""bugs"" from influencing parameter estimation.<br/><br/>For cases where the sources of interest are spinning black-hole pairs, the LSC primarily makes use of two highly-reliable theoretical models based on supercomputer-generated solutions to Einstein's equations of General Relativity. One of these models is called SEOBNRv3 (short for Spinning Effective One Body-Numerical Relativity model, version 3). The SEOBNR series of gravitational waveform models are among the best available for parameter estimation (PE) of spinning black-hole binaries, filling gaps in perturbative waveform approximants with results from numerical relativity simulations. Despite their great efficiency and reliability when compared to numerical relativity waveforms, SEOBNR codes are still far too slow to be directly useful for standard Markov-Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)-based PE.

Now, through a process called electrospinning, it has become possible to make polymer fibers with extremely small diameters, much smaller than a human hair.  Ability to create very small fibers is significant because it opens up the possibility for use in more advanced applications, for example as oil-water separation membranes for provision of clean water (promoting human welfare), or as supports to assist the growth of human cells like neurons (promoting human health). The first part of the research project involves making small diameter polymer fibers and characterizing their properties. The next part involves heating these small diameter fibers to discover what changes will occur in the structure of the fibers when they experience heating.  For example, some fibers when they are heated may shrink, twist up, melt, or completely fall apart, depending upon how much heat they experience, and how fast they are heated up.  There are also positive changes that may occur in the fibers, such as becoming stronger and less likely to break, or developing more resistance to chemicals which could attack them.  Making small diameter fibers and studying these properties will provide important fundamental information to optimize their structure and behavior for use in their intended applications.  The proposed research also will provide education and training to graduate and undergraduate students.  Societal benefit will be derived from the internship program for deaf and hard of hearing students. This program will contribute to improving the diversity of the scientific workforce, by increasing the participation in science and technology of persons with disabilities, who belong to a group under-represented in these fields. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Advanced methods of thermal analysis, such as temperature modulated and fast scanning chip calorimetry, will be used for fundamental studies of electrospun micron to nanoscale fibers. These approaches will be used to study crystallization, and the glass and liquid states, of fibers and droplets made from melting the fibers. Candidate polymers will have glass transition temperatures above room temperature. Examples include nylon 11, poly(ethylene terephthalate), poly(butylene terephthalate), or, poly(vinyl alcohol), which degrades at its melting temperature.  The technical objectives are to: 1. prepare an array of electrospun fibers, and investigate thermal properties in relationship to fiber morphology and structure; 2. use fast scanning chip calorimetry on fibers, including polymers that degrade above their glass transition temperatures, to minimize effects of degradation on thermal properties; and, 3. measure nucleation and growth processes in droplets made from these fibers, and compare with behavior in bulk materials. The amounts of crystal, mobile amorphous, and rigid amorphous phases will be evaluated from the heat capacity increment at the glass transition.  By using the fast scanning approach, the process of nucleation and crystal growth will be evaluated over six orders of magnitude in the cooling rate. The thermal analysis undertaken will provide new experimental protocols and aid in the evaluation of fast scanning data from semicrystalline polymers. The research will increase the participation in STEM fields of under-represented groups, especially persons with disabilities, through the summer program for deaf and hard of hearing undergraduate interns.  Through collaborative projects, fibers for more applied uses will be studied, such as fibers for oil-water separation, or oriented fibers for guided growth of neurons."

The key task of liposomes (storage and delivery to targets) requires them to be flexible enough to merge with target membranes in order to deliver their cargos, and yet to have sufficient structural stability to maintain integrity without rupturing and losing the stored material in the naturally dynamic biological environments.  Therefore,  understanding the mechanics of liposomes is of great interest to both fundamental and applied scientists who are developing artificial, biomimetic liposomes as targeted drug/gene delivery systems for better therapeutics. A major challenge however, is the lack of efficient engineering tools to probe the mechanical flexibility of the sub-cellular, nanoscale liposomes. The research addresses this need by developing a novel method based on nanopore technology that uses electric fields to deform liposomes and electrical measurements to characterize their shape. The overall goal is to characterize the mechanical flexibility of nano-liposomes with the ultimate goal to establish a method to study mechanical properties of nanoscale objects such as  viruses and other biological samples at cellular/molecular level.<br/><br/>This project will advance the engineering tools for mechanical characterization of soft biological materials at the micro/nanoscale. The technology uses nanopore resistive pulse sensing to detect membrane deformation. As liposomes translocate through a nanopore, they experience strong electric stresses and physical confinement, which cause deformation. In this project, liposome shapes will be inferred from ionic current blockade, i.e., the sharp change (pulse) in ohmic resistance when a liposome is present in the pore. A theoretical model for liposome deformation in the nanopore will be developed to yield membrane mechanical properties. The method will enable both high-throughput and single-particle resolution because  (1) thousands of liposomes pass through the nanopore and a resistive pulse will be recorded for each individual one, and (2) thousands of measurements on a single liposome can be made by alternating the applied electric field direction to drive back-and-forth translocation. In broader terms, this method will enable studying mechanobiology at novel unprecedented scales, which is single-virus and single-particle level."

Within the phytoplankton, the diatoms conduct nearly half of this photosynthesis, exerting profound control over global carbon cycling. Despite their importance, there are surprisingly fundamental gaps in understanding how diatoms function in their natural environment, in part because methods to assess in situ physiology are lacking. This project focuses on the application of a powerful new approach, called Quantitative Metabolic Fingerprinting (QMF), to address this knowledge gap and examine species-specific physiology in the field. The project will provide transformative insights into how ocean geochemistry controls the distribution of diatoms, the metabolic responses of individual diatom species, and how metabolic potential is partitioned between diatom species, thus providing new insights into the structure and function of marine systems. The overarching goal is to examine how diatom species respond to changes in biogeochemistry across marine provinces, from the coast to the open ocean, by following shifts in diatom physiology using QMF. This research is critical to understand future changes in oceanic phytoplankton in response to climate and environmental change. Furthermore, activities on this project will include supporting a graduate student and postdoctoral fellow and delivering the Artistic Oceanographer Program (AOP) to diverse middle school age children and teachers in the NYC metropolitan area and to middle-school girls in the Girl Scouts of RI, reaching an anticipated 60 children and 30 teachers annually. The programs will foster multidisciplinary hands-on learning and will directly impact STEM education at a critical point in the pipeline by targeting diverse middle-school aged groups in both NY and RI.<br/><br/>In laboratory studies with cultured isolates, there are profound differences among diatom species' responses to nutrient limitation. Thus, it is likely that different species contribute differently to nutrient uptake, carbon flux and burial. However, marine ecosystem models often rely on physiological attributes drawn from just one species and apply those attributes globally (e.g. coastal species used to model open ocean dynamics) or choose a single average value to represent all species across the world's oceans. In part, this is due to a relatively poor understanding of diatom physiological ecology and a limited tool set for assessing in situ diatom physiological ecology. This research project will address this specific challenge by explicitly tracking metabolic pathways, measuring their regulation and determining their taxonomic distribution in a suite of environmentally significant diatoms using a state of the art, species-specific approach.  A research expedition is set in the North Atlantic, a system that plays a major role in carbon cycling. Starting with a New England coastal shelf site, samples will be collected from the coast where diatoms thrive, to the open ocean and a site of a long term ocean time series station (the Bermuda Atlantic Time Series) where diatom growth is muted by nutrient limitation. This research takes advantage of new ocean observatories initiative (OOI) and time series information. Through the research expedition and downstream laboratory experiments, the molecular pathways of nutrient metabolism and related gene expression in a suite of environmentally significant diatoms will be identified. Data will be combined to predict major limiting factors and potentially important substrates for diatoms across marine provinces. Importantly, this integrated approach takes advantage of new advances in molecular and bioinformatics tools to examine in situ physiological ecology at the species-specific level, a key knowledge gap in the field."

This project examines a number of well-defined synthetic nickel-sulfur compounds and evaluates their reactivity, structure and properties.  The research has impacts on the design and production of a number of catalytic systems, including those important in clean energy, commodity chemical, and pharmaceuticals.   In addition, the project provides an educational platform for the training of highly skilled workers in a number of Science, Technology, Education and Mathematics (STEM) fields.<br/><br/>Cysteinate-ligated metalloenzymes represent a diverse class of biomolecules that are involved in reactions ranging from electron transfer to hydrocarbon functionalization.  Recently, it was discovered that the active site of nickel-iron hydrogenase contains a protonated-coordinated nickel-sulfur bond.  This adds to a small, but growing number of enzymatic systems, such as nickel superoxide dismutase that contain this structural element.  This research group has recently shown that this feature is not only important in modulating the structure and properties of nickel-thiolate ligated systems, but can also be involved in reactions such as proton coupled electron transfer reactions.   This research seeks to understand the properties and reactivities of designed nickel containing small molecules and metallopeptide-based systems that contain the protonated nickel-sulfur bond.  A series of spectroscopic, computational, reactivity, and mechanistic studies are undertaken to understand these systems.

For example, 2D materials are extremely flexible due to their membrane-like thin structure, they interact with light very strongly, and their surfaces are good for sensing molecules and gases. They are currently grown in small quantities only on flat surfaces with poor optical performance which greatly limit their potential. Their successful integration into real-life applications, however, requires new scalable manufacturing technologies capable of producing high quality and high performance 2D materials in large quantities. This award will pave the way to manufacture three-dimensional (3D) networks of 2D materials by conformably coating 2D layers onto 3D substrates by scalable and cost-effective nanomanufacturing techniques. This project will allow large scale manufacturing of 2D material fibers and enable many new applications of atomically thin materials. Additionally, this project includes educational outreach, with a strong emphasis on bringing an understanding of nanoscience and 2D materials to the general public through free open house events and other activities. It will also give hands-on research opportunities to underrepresented groups and minority students. <br/><br/>Pound-for-pound atomically thin 2D materials, such as MoS2, have the potential to generate three-orders of magnitude energy compared to conventional materials such as Si or GaAs. However, when they are grown in planar form, their optical performance greatly suffers from their extreme thinness. This award tackles this problem from a nanomanufacturing point of view by constructing 3D networks of 2D materials. Deposition of 2D materials in 3D geometry has distinct advantages over planar ones as their total surface area, material quantity, and optical performance (absorption and emission) can be increased significantly. However, no systematic studies exist to date on the nanomanufacturing of 3D networks of 2D materials. The research team aims to close the knowledge gap by coating individual electrospun nanofibers with 2D sheets using a cost-effective, reliable, and scalable electrospinning process. Electrospinning is used to produce polymeric alumina nanofibers, which are then crystallized by thermal annealing into desired crystalline phases for successful 2D deposition. Lastly, 2D materials are deposited using a scalable chemical vapor deposition (CVD) process. Material performance of manufactured networks will be tested and techniques will be combined into traditional CVD and electrospinning techniques to realize 2D systems for practical applications."

In the past, structural engineers have focused their attention on creating stronger, more ductile, more reliable lateral-resistance systems that can be used within the walls of buildings to resist the extreme demands associated with these natural hazards. Comparatively little attention has been paid to the role of the floor systems of buildings in resisting these demands. The floor diaphragm acts as a critical element that distributes the demands developed in a building during an extreme event to the lateral-resistance systems and eventually to the building foundation. Steel deck, i.e., thin corrugated steel panels typically with concrete fill, forms one of the most commonly used diaphragm elements in multi-story steel buildings. This project has as its objectives: to develop fundamental understanding of steel deck diaphragms as structural systems integrated within the overall building performance, to develop improved strategies for accurate modeling of floor systems within three-dimensional building models, and to develop new solutions for steel deck diaphragms that enhance the overall structural resilience of buildings.<br/><br/>Current lack of knowledge about floor diaphragm systems impedes a needed evolution for building design approaches from focusing on two-dimensional frame design to enabling creative solutions within three-dimensional building design. The utilization of the diaphragm as an energy dissipating system has not been harnessed nor optimized in buildings. This project will develop a series of building archetypes appropriate to steel deck diaphragms. An integrated experimental program will be conducted at the connection and diaphragm scale, including novel non-contact measurement schemes for revealing damage and deformations during testing, to bridge critical knowledge gaps that currently impede three-dimensional modeling and design of buildings. To explore new solutions for energy-dissipating diaphragms, this project will perform testing of structural fuses and develop prototypes for integrating these fuses into steel diaphragm systems. This project will also complete high fidelity material and geometric nonlinear finite element models to enable detailed investigations of the flow of forces in diaphragms and between the diaphragm and all connected components. A series of lower fidelity, reduced order models will be developed, appropriate for whole building analysis of selected building archetypes. Formal optimization of the role of the diaphragm in building response, including a novel two-level optimization scheme, will be performed. Taken together, these activities will provide a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art for design of building diaphragms. Through a comprehensive outreach effort with industry, the findings will be transferred to engineers and utilized to improve the structural resilience of the nation's buildings."

Unfortunately, these systems are prone to a variety of malicious attacks with potentially disastrous consequences. For example, an attacker might trick an Intrusion Detection System into ignoring the warning signs of a future attack by injecting carefully crafted samples into the training set for the machine learning model (i.e., ""polluting"" the model). This project is creating an approach to machine unlearning and the necessary algorithms, techniques, and systems to efficiently and effectively repair a learning system after it has been compromised. Machine unlearning provides a last resort against various attacks on learning systems, and is complementary to other existing defenses.  <br/><br/>The key insight in machine unlearning is that most learning systems can be converted into a form that can be updated incrementally without costly retraining from scratch. For instance, several common learning techniques (e.g., naive Bayesian classifier) can be converted to the non-adaptive statistical query learning form, which depends only on a constant number of summations, each of which is a sum of some efficiently computable transformation of the training data samples. To repair a compromised learning system in this form, operators add or remove the affected training sample and re-compute the trained model by updating a constant number of summations. This approach yields huge speedup -- the asymptotic speedup over retraining is equal to the size of the training set. With unlearning, operators can efficiently correct a polluted learning system by removing the injected sample from the training set, strengthen an evaded learning system by adding evasive samples to the training set, and prevent system inference attacks by forgetting samples stolen by the attacker so that no future attacks can infer anything about the samples."

Such storms can cause significant direct and indirect losses incurred by communities each year. Wind storm damage mitigation can be achieved by providing an alternative to current design practice through the introduction of loss estimation methodologies for wind-excited buildings that fully embrace the principles of modern performance-based design (PBD). PBD may not only provide new tools that can advance design practices from the limitations of prescriptive codes, but may also enable the rational and holistic performance assessment of a wide class of existing and new buildings under winds through performance metrics that directly promote community resiliency.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a state-of-the-art holistic PBD framework for a wide class of low- to mid-rise buildings sensitive to wind. The framework will focus on the rational determination of the direct and indirect losses caused, for example, by damages sustained to the cladding, internal partitions and ceilings due to water ingress, and debris impact and excessive net pressure acting on the building envelope, as well as damages and losses due to excessive drift or acceleration of the main wind force resisting system of the building. Performance will be expressed through a concise set of system-level decision variables, e.g., expected system-level annual repair costs and downtime that are easily understood by decision-makers and/or stakeholders of diverse technical backgrounds. The framework will be initiated by time-dependent extratropical storm and hurricane models that will include the effects of uncertainties. In order to consistently describe the damages and losses outlined above, specific models will be developed for rigorously describing pressure-induced damage to building envelopes through the use of wind tunnel measured pressure databases. These models will be complemented through the definition of probabilistic models for describing water-induced internal damage and losses, as well as building envelope damage and losses due to excessive pressure and debris impact. The integration of these models can lead to a design framework that will enable a new generation of safer and more economic buildings subject to wind hazards."

The workshop attendees will work together to identify promising directions for future research, exploit the synergies between the two fields, and strengthen the design and innovation capabilities of practitioners. Additionally, current NSF grantees from both ESD and SYS programs (Engineering and Systems Design; Systems Science) will be able to present posters explaining their work and get feedback from their colleagues and the program director. Participants will identify and discuss past contributions that have had a strong impact on education and practice. and discuss their domains of applicability, their limitations, and what needs to be done to strengthen their future potential and impact.  Junior faculty will be given an opportunity to do 'elevator pitches' to help them network with established researchers in the Engineering Design and Systems Engineering communities.<br/><br/>The main objective of the workshop is to enable the engineering design and systems engineering communities to exchange ideas and find synergies. The workshop will bring together about 150 researchers and divide them in small groups of ten to discuss three specific topics. The workshop will have significant impact on the research conducted in engineering design and systems engineering because of the unique challenges and opportunities of designing systems that address global challenges. Such systems require designers to work in a context in which the artifact being ""designed"" is no longer under their control, but rather evolves through interactions between multiple/many stakeholders, effectively resulting in complex adaptive systems. This unique context will have an impact on the choice and characteristics of design methods because, rather than making decisions about the artifact, one would need to worry about how to influence other stakeholders so that they make choices that as a whole lead to desirable outcomes. To address this objective, the workshop will conduct discussions on three topics: (1) What are the greatest and unique research challenges and roadblocks? (2) What constitutes good research & good research methods? (3) What are the gaps and unique opportunities for developing synergistic methods between engineering design and systems engineering communities?"

This project will examine a novel role for these predators, which is their ability to generate hotspots of biological activity by controlling carrion resources. Understanding the diverse functions of apex predators will contribute to sustainable wilderness management, directly enhancing citizen enjoyment and appreciation of wilderness and wildlife for recreation. The project will also advance public awareness of the importance of apex predators, improving societal awareness of wilderness and wildlife preservation. Efforts to maintain carrion resources will help to sustain other species and ecosystem health. The investigators will work with wildlife managers in US National Parks to develop educational maps for outreach and interpretation. Animal remains and scavenger activity created at carcass sites are visually captivating to students of all ages. Investigators will partner with the Western Upper Peninsula Michigan Center for Science, Mathematics and Environmental Education to create a regional remote camera lending depot and lesson plans for recording biological activity at carcass sites. These activities will engage K-12 educators and students in the field of carrion ecology.<br/><br/>Carrion occurs in all biomes. It represents a bottleneck in the vital flow of energy and limiting nutrients with profound ecological and evolutionary consequences. Carrion constitutes a critical resource for a variety of communities and it strongly affects scavenger guilds, the maintenance of biodiversity, and fundamental ecological processes. This research will investigate the poorly understood role of predation in controlling carrion resources, shaping carcass distributions, and generating a shifting mosaic of biogeochemical and community activity. Two interrelated sets of questions will be addressed across four terrestrial ecosystems: 1) How do carrion-derived effects vary across multiple ecosystems and across a diversity of predator-prey communities? And 2) How does predation influence carrion distribution across space and time? Experiments and field studies will reveal above and belowground carrion effects across key biomes. This understanding will be coupled with spatial records of carcasses to examine predator control of carrion resources across multiple scales. Data from experiments, field studies and carcass records will be incorporated into spatial models to examine predator-carrion dynamics and predation controls over carrion resource flow compared to die-offs. The focal systems span a range of ecosystems and predator-prey diversity, and will yield both general patterns and identify distinct differences in predator control of carrion resources across biomes.  In examining predator control of carrion resources, this work addresses both the fundamental focus in ecology on  mechanisms of trophic control of community and ecosystem structure and explores a novel concept that can add to a comprehensive view of the ecological role of predators."

Polymer nanofibers can be used to produce lightweight composite materials, nanoelectronics, efficient energy storage and conversion devices, highly responsive sensors, and biomedical devices where their small dimension enhances performance. Nanomaterials are theoretically expected to outperform conventional materials in categories such as mechanical strength, conductivity, and sensing. However, in practice, electrospun nanofibers are much weaker than larger conventional fibers even when adjusting for the size effect. This award supports fundamental research into a new manufacturing process that stretches pliable electrospun nanofibers during manufacture in the same way as the drawing process that is used in conventional fiber manufacturing and that is known to enhance the mechanical strength and functional properties of larger-scale fibers. The key advantage of the new method is that it can be implemented as an additional stage in the continuous electrospinning process and is amenable to full scale production. This work will support the advancement of innovative nanofiber materials for application in a wide variety of technologies and industries. Execution of this project will involve graduate and undergraduate researchers who will gain firsthand experience in nanotechnology. Underrepresented K-12 students will be exposed to the project through various outreach activities. <br/><br/>It has been hypothesized that the poor macromolecular alignment and mechanical properties observed in electrospun nanofibers is due to chain relaxation in the presence of residual solvent. Strategies to investigate and overcome this challenge have been limited by an overall lack of control over fiber organization and manipulation that preclude fundamental fiber processing techniques such as post-stretching. This work will utilize parallel automated tracks to simultaneously immobilize and stretch thousands of individual nanofibers. Nanofibers can be wet-stretched in the semi-solid state immediately upon collection before solvent has fully evaporated. A systematic investigation of processing parameters such as total elongation, rate of elongation, and solvent evaporation rate will be conducted for several different polymers, proteins and carbon materials to determine their relationship to final nanofiber molecular and functional properties. The influence of nanofiber diameter on the mechanisms of wet-stretching will offer new insights into unique nanoscale effects such as molecular confinement."

In the past, structural engineers have focused their attention on creating stronger, more ductile, more reliable lateral-resistance systems that can be used within the walls of buildings to resist the extreme demands associated with these natural hazards. Comparatively little attention has been paid to the role of the floor systems of buildings in resisting these demands. The floor diaphragm acts as a critical element that distributes the demands developed in a building during an extreme event to the lateral-resistance systems and eventually to the building foundation. Steel deck, i.e., thin corrugated steel panels typically with concrete fill, forms one of the most commonly used diaphragm elements in multi-story steel buildings. This project has as its objectives: to develop fundamental understanding of steel deck diaphragms as structural systems integrated within the overall building performance, to develop improved strategies for accurate modeling of floor systems within three-dimensional building models, and to develop new solutions for steel deck diaphragms that enhance the overall structural resilience of buildings.<br/><br/>Current lack of knowledge about floor diaphragm systems impedes a needed evolution for building design approaches from focusing on two-dimensional frame design to enabling creative solutions within three-dimensional building design. The utilization of the diaphragm as an energy dissipating system has not been harnessed nor optimized in buildings. This project will develop a series of building archetypes appropriate to steel deck diaphragms. An integrated experimental program will be conducted at the connection and diaphragm scale, including novel non-contact measurement schemes for revealing damage and deformations during testing, to bridge critical knowledge gaps that currently impede three-dimensional modeling and design of buildings. To explore new solutions for energy-dissipating diaphragms, this project will perform testing of structural fuses and develop prototypes for integrating these fuses into steel diaphragm systems. This project will also complete high fidelity material and geometric nonlinear finite element models to enable detailed investigations of the flow of forces in diaphragms and between the diaphragm and all connected components. A series of lower fidelity, reduced order models will be developed, appropriate for whole building analysis of selected building archetypes. Formal optimization of the role of the diaphragm in building response, including a novel two-level optimization scheme, will be performed. Taken together, these activities will provide a significant advancement in the state-of-the-art for design of building diaphragms. Through a comprehensive outreach effort with industry, the findings will be transferred to engineers and utilized to improve the structural resilience of the nation's buildings."

Highlights of collaborative activities include student access to and learning from UNU-EHS, UBonn, and other international disaster risk reduction experts, student research training activities, spatial data set acquisition, and access to international scientific networks only available in Bonn. The primary student research project is to create and rigorously evaluate a Disaster Risk Reduction - Information Capacity Index (DRR-ICI). A DRR-ICI currently does not exist. The scientific purpose of the DRR-ICI is to quantify and evaluate how disaster risk reduction geographic information capacities such as information availability, scale and relevancy vary within Germany and from country to country. The project will advance discovery and understanding while promoting teaching, training, and learning by creating unique linkages to international organizations that will train, educate and professionally develop the next generation of interdisciplinary STEM research scientists focused on disaster risk reduction and GIS. Intellectual products created by IRES students, such as the DRR-ICI, will provide important benefits to society that can bring global attention to disaster risk reduction research and GIS potentially saving lives when disasters occur. The project is particularly strong in enhancing infrastructure for research and education as IRES students will become part of both the UN and German disaster stakeholder networks that are only available by being on-site in Bonn.<br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>The research team will create transformative knowledge on understanding the relationship between geographic information capacity and disaster risk reduction ? an area that has received little research attention despite the overall importance of geographic information for disaster risk reduction.

The DRR-ICI developed by students will provide practical, intellectual products for disaster risk reduction teaching and learning that can transition into real use in the event of a disaster."

The key task of liposomes (storage and delivery to targets) requires them to be flexible enough to merge with target membranes in order to deliver their cargos, and yet to have sufficient structural stability to maintain integrity without rupturing and losing the stored material in the naturally dynamic biological environments.  Therefore,  understanding the mechanics of liposomes is of great interest to both fundamental and applied scientists who are developing artificial, biomimetic liposomes as targeted drug/gene delivery systems for better therapeutics. A major challenge however, is the lack of efficient engineering tools to probe the mechanical flexibility of the sub-cellular, nanoscale liposomes. The research addresses this need by developing a novel method based on nanopore technology that uses electric fields to deform liposomes and electrical measurements to characterize their shape. The overall goal is to characterize the mechanical flexibility of nano-liposomes with the ultimate goal to establish a method to study mechanical properties of nanoscale objects such as  viruses and other biological samples at cellular/molecular level.<br/><br/>This project will advance the engineering tools for mechanical characterization of soft biological materials at the micro/nanoscale. The technology uses nanopore resistive pulse sensing to detect membrane deformation. As liposomes translocate through a nanopore, they experience strong electric stresses and physical confinement, which cause deformation. In this project, liposome shapes will be inferred from ionic current blockade, i.e., the sharp change (pulse) in ohmic resistance when a liposome is present in the pore. A theoretical model for liposome deformation in the nanopore will be developed to yield membrane mechanical properties. The method will enable both high-throughput and single-particle resolution because  (1) thousands of liposomes pass through the nanopore and a resistive pulse will be recorded for each individual one, and (2) thousands of measurements on a single liposome can be made by alternating the applied electric field direction to drive back-and-forth translocation. In broader terms, this method will enable studying mechanobiology at novel unprecedented scales, which is single-virus and single-particle level."

All trading in a smart market is intermediated by a market manager in charge of clearing. Examples include electricity markets (where network capacity constraints must be satisfied while taking into account power flow) and spectrum auctions for allocating channels (where combinatorial optimization is needed to identify an efficient allocation). This project addresses the problem of designing smart markets when the solution of a non-trivial computational model has to be consulted to determine the feasibility of a given allocation profile.  Since such a model is not transparent to the market manager, it is often referred to as a ""black-box"" model.  As an example, the project will focus on the allocation of spectrum access under signaling technologies other than frequency division, which is an instance of this problem because a precise determination of communication capacity can only be obtained by consulting black-box models that take into account the effects of interference amongst users.<br/><br/>This project will focus on the design of smart markets to ensure the efficient allocation of black-box capacity under incomplete information regarding the users' willingness to pay for capacity.  The designs considered are iterative in nature. The idea is to allow (at each iteration) a form of self-scheduling by users onto available resources followed by a black-box evaluation of excess capacity, which in turn informs price updates. A key design novelty pertains to the use of different time-scales for pricing (fast) vs. capacity allocation (slow) adjustments. Personalized incentives for each user (in the forms of additional payments or transfers) guarantee that it is a dominant strategy for users to truthfully report their demand throughout the process. Several additional research directions including noisy black-box model and non-convex feasible regions will be considered. Additionally, the application of the smart market designs to electricity markets with high levels of renewable capacity will be considered. If successful, the project will contribute to ensuring that the market dispatch of available resources meets a certain reliability target with highly intermittent nature of renewable output."

The project seeks to improve undergraduate education to address the projected shortfall in geoscientists, promote the participation of underrepresented groups in both geoscience majors and careers, and contribute to research on strengthening partnerships between higher education institutions and external geoscience organizations. The project will increase the number and diversity of skilled workers entering the geoscience workforce and lead to best practice strategies that can be implemented at other universities to impact meaningfully on the retention, education, and career trajectories of geoscience majors."

However, critical limitations exist on the performance of current-generation materials, motivating the development of new paradigms for responsive polymer networks, alongside efforts to improve our understanding of these materials on both molecular and macroscopic scales. The current project seeks to take advantage of the unique benefits offered by polymer networks based on ionic liquids (ILs), which are salts with low melting points (often below room temperature) that have useful properties including low volatility and good electrical conductivity and stability.  The proposed networks of polymers and ILs could enable transformative advances in the design of shape-morphing materials that can operate under a wide range of environmental conditions and in response to low-voltage electrical control signals. The fundamental understanding developed through the work will also hold relevance for IL-based polymer materials in other contexts including soft, flexible, and responsive electronic devices, or as membranes for batteries or fuel cells. The project will engage, mentor, and train a diverse group of participants at a variety of levels ranging from K-12 students and the general public, to graduate students and post-doctoral fellows, with a particular emphasis on expanding a partnership with high-school students in nearby Springfield, MA.<br/> <br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>While shape-morphing polymer networks have seen rapid recent advances, state-of-the-art materials suffer from key limitations. For example, stimuli-responsive polymer hydrogels typically rely on exchange of water with their surroundings, limiting operation to aqueous environments, while dielectric elastomer actuators require very high triggering voltages of ca. 10 kV to function. The current effort seeks to take advantage of the special properties of ionic liquid (IL)-based polymer materials, in particular their very low volatility, high ionic conductivity, and good electrochemical stability, to enable new classes of responsive and shape-morphing polymer networks. Motivated by these goals, the PI will conduct fundamental studies of the thermodynamics, response kinetics, mechanics, and electrical characteristics of IL-based polymers and networks, and demonstrate new types of responsive materials that are capable of functioning in non-hydrated environments and in response to low voltage electrical signals.  Alongside the new capabilities for the design of soft actuators and shape morphing materials, the fundamental understanding gained will have broad relevance for IL-based polymer networks in stimuli-responsive materials, membranes, and iontronic devices."

Sleep also plays a very important role in learning and memory.  Sleep helps babies to solidify newly learned information in their memories, a process known as consolidation. The goal of this project is to study the role of sleep in motor learning -- acquiring a new skill involving physical coordination of movement. The results will provide important insights into how the timing and quality of sleep infants experience influences their ability to consolidate new motor learning.<br/><br/>The proposed work bridges three areas of research: cognitive development, motor development, and sleep. Infants who have just begun walking independently will learn to complete a tunnel navigation task.  Following the task, infants will experience a delay during which some will nap and others will not. The impact of napping on learning will then be assessed. A sleep monitor (actigraph) will be employed to assess individual differences in quality of sleep and how sleep quality relates to learning. Measures of sleep prior to training and on the following night will permit investigation of the unique contributions of day and night sleep to infant learning. This study will be the first to directly examine sleep and motor learning in infancy, the first to study the contribution of night sleep on infant motor learning, and the first to examine whether individual differences in the quality of sleep mediates the effect of sleep on learning. The proposed research will ultimately provide guidelines for balancing between enriched learning experiences and a protective environment that promotes rest and regulation.

Unfortunately, these systems are prone to a variety of malicious attacks with potentially disastrous consequences. For example, an attacker might trick an Intrusion Detection System into ignoring the warning signs of a future attack by injecting carefully crafted samples into the training set for the machine learning model (i.e., ""polluting"" the model). This project is creating an approach to machine unlearning and the necessary algorithms, techniques, and systems to efficiently and effectively repair a learning system after it has been compromised. Machine unlearning provides a last resort against various attacks on learning systems, and is complementary to other existing defenses.  <br/><br/>The key insight in machine unlearning is that most learning systems can be converted into a form that can be updated incrementally without costly retraining from scratch. For instance, several common learning techniques (e.g., naive Bayesian classifier) can be converted to the non-adaptive statistical query learning form, which depends only on a constant number of summations, each of which is a sum of some efficiently computable transformation of the training data samples. To repair a compromised learning system in this form, operators add or remove the affected training sample and re-compute the trained model by updating a constant number of summations. This approach yields huge speedup -- the asymptotic speedup over retraining is equal to the size of the training set. With unlearning, operators can efficiently correct a polluted learning system by removing the injected sample from the training set, strengthen an evaded learning system by adding evasive samples to the training set, and prevent system inference attacks by forgetting samples stolen by the attacker so that no future attacks can infer anything about the samples."

Applications for infrared sources and detectors include night vision and surveillance, wireless communication, and chemical and biological sensing. Most current infrared applications rely on expensive and hazardous materials. Bismuth containing III-V semiconductors are non-toxic and may be directly integrated into existing fabrication lines, further reducing cost. However, growing these materials is nontrivial due to the complex interactions of Bi with the other elements in these compounds. In this project, the growth and optical properties of Bi-containing compound semiconductors are examined with an eye on infrared detector applications. The mode in which this research is performed is also important, because it combines experimental and computational methods to speed the pace of discovery. This project also develops pedagogical modules that are used in a variety of situations, thus augmenting our infrastructure for education and broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in science and engineering related majors. <br/><br/>Technical description: The novelty of this research is in coupling experiments with computations when studying an unknown and highly complex alloy system. A calculate-verify cycle is used to establish the growth parameters and to obtain films that have the desired lattice parameter and band structure. ab initio statistical mechanics combines Density Functional Theory, cluster expansions, and statistical Monte-Carlo to calculate the equilibrium properties, including band structure of the GaAsSbBi alloy. In tandem, growth modeling based on kinetic Monte Carlo is used to understand deviations from equilibrium behavior. Robust experimental methods for the growth (Molecular Beam Epitaxy) and atomic-scale characterization (Atom Probe Tomography, X-Ray Diffraction, Rutherford Backscattering, etc) are employed. Using experiments coupled with computation greatly reduces parameter space and speed the path to optimization of this new class of materials suitable for infrared devices."

Importantly, these motor skills are often used in new situations, where attention may be distracted by other events or objects. For example, during an emergency the pilot must continue to operate the aircraft while maintaining communications with ground authorities and other crew members and assessing the state of the aircraft. Similarly, a stroke patient recovering the ability to walk must attend to cars, other pedestrians, and obstacles in the path in order to avoid collisions. Attentional demands may also differ when a motor skill is first learned and when it is performed at a later time. What if skills learned when there is no distraction deteriorate when distractions are present at recall, or vice versa? How might motor learning programs be developed that can train successful transfer of motor skills to novel situations? With the support of an NSF CAREER award, Dr. Joo-Hyun Song at Brown University will characterize mechanisms involved in coping with attentional distractions during motor learning and will develop a training program to promote robust long-term learning despite a wide range of distractions. <br/><br/>Dr. Song will mentor nationally and locally selected undergraduates in a 10-week summer research program, with participants recruited through two initiatives designed to prepare qualified undergraduates from diverse minority backgrounds for M.D. and Ph.D. programs (the Blueprint Program for Enhancing Neuroscience Diversity through Undergraduate Research Education Experiences and the Leadership Alliance Summer Research-Early Identification Program). Dr. Song will also provide a longer-term nationwide mentoring program for under-represented students identified from minority-serving institutions (from the end of their freshman year to graduation).

Climate change is one such disturbance that is expected to result in a re-organization of global biodiversity, including shifts in species geographic distribution and increases in rates of extinctions.  Alterations in local species populations may impact the functioning of ecosystems and the services they provide for humans. However, natural ecosystems might prove more resilient that we think if species better adapted to new climates can immigrate or if local populations can adapt to the changes. In this project, researchers will manipulate entire ponds to understand the degree to which these ecosystems are resilient to the climate-induced expansion of a top aquatic predator. As winters warm, the marbled salamander is rapidly colonizing newly suitable temporary ponds in New England. Marbled salamanders are top predators in these ponds and can strongly reduce biodiversity and shift pond ecosystems to a state characterized by high algal production. The project will have broader impacts on society beyond contributing to fundamental science and conservation. The investigators will create a scientific internship for K-12 teachers and an undergraduate internship focusing on students from underrepresented groups.  They will also develop a system of linked remote video cameras to record and broadcast the annual amphibian migration, as a means of public outreach.<br/><br/>In a region where climate change is promoting the rapid expansion of a top predator, the investigators will quantify how immigration and adaptive evolution facilitate ecological and evolutionary rescue. The work will focus on ecological resilience originating from the immigration of species that can restore diversity and replace lost functional roles and the adaptive evolution of an intermediate consumer previously shown to mediate the impacts of the apex predator on community structure. The project advances fundamental and applied questions by 1) performing one of the first tests of resilience theory in parallel, repeated, whole-ecosystem experiments; 2) allowing a comparison of ecological versus evolutionary mechanisms of resilience; 3) challenging the existing paradigm that predictions about biotic responses can ignore landscape connectivity and adaptive variation; 4) initiating an important long-term study on evolution in wild vertebrates; and 5) developing a generalizable understanding of how apex predators alter freshwater systems as they expand in a warming world. The project takes a multi-tiered approach in order to develop insights about two fundamental responses to predator introductions across space and time to contribute to building a broader, more mechanistic understanding of eco-evolutionary resistance to food web changes."

They can be formed in multilayers and molecular complexes and are of interest in applications ranging from biomedical to temperature-responsive materials.  Such polyelectrolytes undergo an unusual ""glass-melt"" or softening transition whose nature and time-dependence are not well understood.  Here the PI proposes to evaluate the direct origin of this transition using experimental techniques that will probe it on a molecular level. This will provide a firm view of how the transition and its dynamics interrelate with regard to temperature, water, and charges arising from different salts. This project places a unique emphasis on salt type, where a broad range of salts with varying size, charge, and water interactions are examined. One possible outcome is a unified relationship among temperature, water, and salt as it governs the transition. This will be of significant importance because this new knowledge will allow fine-tuning of the transition temperature and the physical properties associated with these materials, ultimately leading to possible new advanced applications. A major element of the proposed research is to educate, mentor, and train a future generation of diverse workers skilled in science as well as to offer science outreach to the general public both locally and online.<br/><br/> <br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/> <br/>Experiments are proposed to investigate the nature of the thermal transition observed in hydrated polyelectrolyte complexes and multilayers.

The proposed approach centers on quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation, differential scanning calorimetry, and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, temperature-controlled Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and dynamic mechanical analysis. The proposed project is comprised of four activities: (1) investigate water-poly(styrene sulfonate) interactions within polyelectrolyte multilayers as a function of temperature, (2) explore and determine the role of water and other solvents, (3) examine and understand the role of salt on the transition, and (4) determine possible water-salt connections and effects on dynamics associated with the transition.

Experiments conducted over the next few years will make dramatic progress testing the extent to which dark matter is a particle that interacts with ordinary matter.  Meanwhile, the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) is exploring the highest energies ever probed.  The LHC recently discovered a remarkable new particle, the Higgs boson, and is now studying the properties of this new particle.   The LHC may also discover additional new particles as well.  Against this backdrop, Professor Ruderman will pursue an original program of research and education concentrating on the origins of dark matter and the Higgs.  He will study the exciting possibility that there exist new hidden sectors of particles which have thus far escaped experimental detection because they are very weakly interacting with ordinary particles.  He will explore new models in which dark matter is a hidden-sector particle, or in which the Higgs boson interacts with hidden-sector particles.  In order to help in spreading physics to a broad audience, Professor Ruderman will also establish a competitive ""Physics in Media Travel Award"".    He will partner with NYU's Tisch School of the Arts to send film students to visit physics experiments that will appear in their movies.  He will also partner with NYU's Science, Health and Environmental Reporting Program (SHERP) to send science journalism students to visit physics experiments which will be featured in their stories.  Resulting films will be screened at local high schools, and resulting stories will be disseminated online in various journalism venues.<br/><br/>More specifically, Professor Ruderman will explore novel cosmologies for hidden-sector dark matter in which the annihilation rate is exponentially suppressed, predicting dark matter exponentially lighter than the TeV scale. This exponential suppression occurs when dark matter annihilates into heavier states, or is in equilibrium with heavier particles that are annihilating.   Professor Ruderman will develop new observational tests for light dark matter, including searches for UV and soft X-ray photons emitted by dark-matter decays or annihilations.  Professor Ruderman will also explore the interplay of hidden sectors with Higgs physics.  He will develop novel models with a fine-tuned Higgs mass and light hidden-sector scalars that interact with the Higgs.  He will also explore supersymmetric models with a natural Higgs mass in which stops are light and abundantly produced at the LHC but nevertheless hidden behind top-quark backgrounds."

On the other hand, robots inspired by passive dynamics use trivial amounts of energy to move but are limited to a single speed and step length. This project develops a theory that fills this knowledge gap by enabling bipedal robots to make informed decisions about what strategy to follow given a particular circumstance. For example, on rough terrains, a robot may have to decide to expend more energy in order to maximize stability while, in cases where the terrain is flat and regular, the same robot can decide to use its most energy-efficient gait while paying little heed to stability.<br/><br/>There is a need to develop a theory that would simultaneously enable improved performance metrics for the energy-efficiency and versatility of bipedal robots. The instability of bipedal robots, due to their inverted pendulum like nature, makes this challenge even greater; hence, metrics for balance and stability also need to be met simultaneously. The gap in knowledge is that, it is unclear how to enable bipedal robots to satisfy all these performance metrics, some of which can actually be conflicting (e.g., energy-efficiency trade-offs with stability)."

Used in the opposite direction, these techniques can take certain kinds of lengthy calculations and replace them with short, abstract arguments which can then be generalized to prove new results.

An explicit quantitative approach to such dichotomies has long been central to extremal graph theory, but recent work has shown that these can also be viewed in measure-theoretic terms by using ultraproducts to mediate between the finitary and infinitary perspectives, leading to new results in the area.  Towsner will study this connection systematically, both developing new tools in the infinitary setting and using the proof-theoretic functional interpretation to translate these tools back to the classical setting, extracting explicit calculations from these infinitary arguments."

Given the steady U.S. population migration to urban centers, recruits will increasingly need to come from students who were raised in cities. The issues involved with recruiting urban geoscientists closely parallel those for recruiting from underrepresented groups. Many students and their families are unaware of the growing opportunities in the geosciences for careers that use advanced technology to solve some of the most challenging problems facing society. Urban geoscientists work on a wide range of local problems including waste management, flood control, beach nourishment, transportation infrastructure, land subsidence, and the environmental impact of ""fracking.""  To increase the size and diversity of the geoscience workforce and keep pace with demand in the 21st century, this project is testing new strategies, assessing what works, and sharing the model of an urban geoscience learning community with other universities.  New strategies include: developing materials highlighting career opportunities in urban geoscience, peer coaching in mathematics to assist students transitioning into science from other disciplines, and student apprenticeships to boost employment opportunities.  <br/><br/>The Career Paths for Urban Geoscientists initiative includes three main components. First, student recruitment is focused on developing career information for students and their parents to overcome misconceptions about opportunities. This information is being provided to prospective students during visits to the university, in general education and introductory-level courses in the department, and to the Alliance for Minority Participation on campus.  In addition to career information, service learning modules are being included in general education classes to inform students about applications for their new geology skills. Second, the Urban Geoscientists initiative is focusing on retention of new majors through a math-mentoring program. Math requirements are often a serious obstacle for students switching from non-science majors, and a reason many drop out of the science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) majors.  The Math Partners program is pairing junior and senior geology and environmental science majors who have completed at least one semester of calculus as mentors for newly recruited majors. New students are benefiting from one-on-one coaching by majors who have experienced their struggles and who can help them grasp the increasingly important connections between quantitative skills and careers in the geosciences. The mentors reinforce their own understanding of mathematics through teaching.  Working together also promotes camaraderie within the major. The third component of the project is focused on enhancing Career Paths for Urban Geoscientists through apprenticeship that prepare them for the workforce. This includes a new certificate program that teaches job skills, internship opportunities with local companies, and undergraduate research experiences working with graduate students and faculty. The creation of learning communities of urban geoscientists involving alumni, faculty, undergraduate students, and graduate students in both science and education strengthens the initiative and is an explicit goal of this project. Assessment tools are being employed to determine the efficacy and timing of intervention. Outcomes such as an increase in majors, fewer repeated math courses, and retention in STEM are being assessed by demographic groupings. Using Temple University as a model of urban geosciences, the findings of this project are expected to be important for nation-wide recruiting through application at other universities striving to recruit and retain students from diverse backgrounds and prepare them for successful geoscience careers."

These models can form a basis for planning and implementing vaccination strategies, evaluating the risks and benefits of travel bans, and improving the effectiveness of prophylaxis campaigns. However traditional modeling approaches do not fully capture the national and international mobility characteristic of modern society, where contacts do not remain geographically confined to the area of the initial outbreak, and an infection may jump thousands of miles in a single day. This project will advance fundamental understanding of dynamical systems evolving on reconfigurable networks, in which the subsystems and the network connections change on comparable time-scales. The resulting mathematical framework will enable a new class of predictive models of infectious disease spread. These models will aid in safeguarding uninfected populations and in mitigating impact on afflicted nations, even when, as in the case of Ebola Virus Disease, no therapeutic protocol is available. More broadly, the underlying theoretical advances are expected to transform the analysis, design, and control of dynamical systems on rapidly reconfiguring networks. Complementing the research component of this project is outreach to promote the education of underprivileged students and to serve economically-disadvantaged communities.<br/><br/>This research program seeks to advance the field of dynamical systems and complex networks toward tractable mathematical models of infectious disease epidemics. Specifically, this project will establish a theoretical framework for the study of the concurrent evolution of the dynamics of infectious diseases and the formation of the network of contacts through which they spread. The framework will be based on the notion of activity-driven networks, which can be effectively utilized to model contact processes that evolve over time-varying networks across a range of time-scales. This modeling paradigm contrasts that of traditional connectivity-driven networks, where links between nodes have a long life span, resulting in the separation between the time-scales of the dynamics of the network connections and the process evolution. The research team will seek to understand the effect of non-ideal containment procedures on the spread of infectious disease through the systematic analysis of global and local network features; devise strategies for community detection in time-varying networks, toward identifying untraced contacts that are critical for disease spreading and of great public concern; and establish model-based optimization strategies to prioritize contact tracing procedures toward improving the effectiveness and outcomes of control interventions."

Such technologies have been in demand in the intelligence and defense communities for many years, and they now underlie many commercially available information-management tools.  This project develops robust algorithms that understand natural language expressions by mapping them to formal representations of their meaning, a technique known as semantic parsing.  For semantic parsing to be employed in technologies like those listed above, it needs to overcome the fundamental challenge of broad coverage, the ability to handle any text input, in multiple languages.  This project meets this challenge by creating new methods for gathering large repositories of semantically annotated data at greatly reduced cost; these are then used to train much more accurate broad-coverage parsing models.  The results of this project include open-source implementations, high-quality annotated corpora on an unprecedented scale, and reusable distributed semantic representations for use by the community of natural language processing researchers and practitioners. <br/><br/>The goal of broad-coverage semantic parsing can only be achieved by simultaneously focusing on new, large scale sources of data with semantically meaningful annotations and new learning algorithms for inducing models with the representational capacity to make full use of such data.  For scalable data collection, this project introduces new techniques that rely on two key complementary insights: (1) any reader who understands a text can answer questions about it, and (2) questions can be constructed whose answers probe any aspect of semantics that need to be recovered.  These observations allow designing new data collection techniques that reduce the burden of semantic annotation by providing simple questions and answers about texts.  This QA-style annotation can be done for any text in any language, given only native speakers, bypassing the significant effort that currently goes into defining detailed annotation standards.  It also allows gathering new datasets on a much larger scale, and for more diverse text types, than ever before.  In addition, the project develops new representation learning techniques that tie together a wide range of semantic annotation styles, including the new crowdsourced ones, in a multitask learning setup.  Continuous representations (e.g., of word types) provide a powerful way to allow sharing of statistical strength across a large vocabulary, many of whose elements are sparsely observed.  While past work has emphasized learning word embeddings, this project employs a shared continuous space (""framespace"") that can capture abstract frames and roles used in predicate-argument (and logical) semantics.  The usefulness of these representations depends on the tasks they are trained to perform, and using multiple related tasks can lead to benefits on all of them, by sharing of statistical strength across task-specific representations, across elements of the semantic lexicon, and even across languages."

Such coatings could be used, e.g., for biomedical or optical applications.  Examples might be coatings that can deliver drugs locally in a multi-stage, time-resolved protocol,  or structured polymer films that can serve as precursors for better anti-reflective optical coatings. To support these advanced applications, (a) the coatings should be able to be easily deposited on a variety of surfaces via an environmentally friendly process, and (b) their structure should be easily controlled by the deposition procedure and conditions. The layer-by-layer (LbL) technique is a unique method which, through a deposition process entirely in water can create conformal coatings of controlled thickness on virtually any surface. The challenge, however, is to control the mixing of polymer molecules within the coated film to preserve film layering.  This project will explore the effect of various molecular and deposition parameters on film layering, with the goal of achieving structured films which can be deposited through fewer steps. Advanced instrumental techniques will be used to take snapshots of how multilayered structures, water content, and film mechanical properties can be manipulated. <br/><br/>Importantly, this project will create a fertile training ground for the participating graduate, undergraduate and high-school students. The PI is currently the academic advisor of the ""Women in Materials Science"" (WIMS) organization, which is strongly involved in many outreach activities, ranging from on-campus tours and demonstrations for Girl Scouts and high-school students to visits to local schools with the goal of encouraging and engaging female and minority 5-7th graders to pursue careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/><br/><br/>PART II: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The ability to control dynamics and the structure of layer-by-layer (LbL) polyelectrolyte films lies at the heart of advanced biomedical and optical applications of polyelectrolyte multilayer (PEM) films. Of specific interest are films with defined and controlled internal stratification. Yet nonlinearly growing LbL films (NL-LbLs) which deposit at larger thicknesses and therefore are highly desirable for many applications, suffer from molecular intermixing. This proposal aims to (a) uncover the mechanism of polymer chain diffusion within NL-PEMs during film growth, (b) establish correlations between molecular interactions, dynamics, and order for a broad range of NL-PEM films and (c) use this knowledge to control structure of NL-PEMs and develop strategies for constructing stratified and gradient LbL films. This project will involve synthesizing well-defined polybase-polyacid (PB-PA) pairs associated through ionic pairing or hydrogen-bonding. Interchain dynamics will be studied during PEM assembly, as well as at a post-assembly step. Neutron reflectometry (NR) will be used to track diffusion of polymer chains across the film thickness, in situ ellipsometry to determine film water content, and nanoindentation to explore film mechanical properties during film construction. At the post-assembly step, NR will be applied to resolve internal stratification, and fluorescence recovery after pattern photobleaching (FRAP) to study lateral mobility of assembled chains. This knowledge will then be used to rationally construct films with programmable density, water content, charge balance, and permeability. It will also enable rationally designed diffusional barriers and gradients of water content within NL-PEM films, in order to achieve films useful as matrices for conformal antireflective coatings or for sequential drug delivery via improved control of permeability of functional molecules."

If the decision-maker can quantify the cost as a function of the decision variables, then computational methods can be used to obtain or approximate the optimal decision. For complicated cost functions arising in practice it may not be possible to know for sure that a proposed solution is optimal and one must settle for an approximate solution. Typical examples of such problems include choosing well sites and pumping rates for ground water pollution remediation, aligning medical images taken at different times, and determining the configuration of a collection of atoms that minimizes the potential energy. This award supports research into methods for solving such optimization problems and characterizing their inherent difficulty as the number of decision variables increases. These methods will be applicable to a broad range of problems in engineering, science, and industry.<br/><br/>The optimization problems described above are called global optimization problems. It is well-known that global optimization is intractable in high dimensions in the worst-case complexity setting. The investigator will determine if continuous optimization is tractable in an asymptotic or average-case setting by establishing both upper and lower complexity bounds. The investigator will obtain upper complexity bounds by devising new optimization algorithms and proving their convergence rates. The project will use two approaches to algorithm design. One approach is to subdivide the domain into polytopes, and choose new function evaluation points within the polytope that maximize a criterion based on the size of the polytope and the observed function values at its vertices. The other approach is to use randomized point selection schemes that aim to obtain comparable results to the first approach, on average, but without the computational cost of maintaining the polyhedral subdivisions. The lower complexity bounds will establish the smallest error that can be obtained with any algorithm that uses a given average number of function evaluations. A key question that this research will attempt to answer is whether the lower complexity bounds grow exponentially with the dimension."

Strontium titanate, a transparent crystal, exhibits large persistent photoconductivity at room temperature, opening up new possibilities for practical devices.

Educational outreach activities include visits to reservations in rural areas to enhance Washington's workforce diversity in science and technology.<br/><br/>Technical description: The project builds on the discovery of persistent photoconductivity in annealed strontium titanate single crystals. This phenomenon is unique because the enhanced conductivity is large, very persistent, and occurs at room temperature. It is tentatively attributed to the excitation of an electron from a defect level to the conduction band, with an extremely low recapture rate though, the exact origin and behavior of this defect is currently unrevealed. The primary goals of this research project are: (i) to elucidate the defect physics behind persistent photoconductivity, and (ii) to use the persistent photoconductivity to optically define reconfigurable circuits. A variety of experimental methods, including Hall effect, infrared spectroscopy, and photoluminescence, are used to study the persistent photoconductivity and the defects responsible for it. Lithographic and confocal-microscopy techniques are utilized to write circuits on the crystal surface and in the interior, respectively. This approach could provide a basis for 3D electronic architectures, with current paths and active devices throughout the bulk of an oxide crystal."

However, polytetrafluoroethylene coatings are easily worn because of their poor adhesion to the substrates, severely limitating their applications. This award supports fundamental research on a novel approach to significantly improve the wear resistance of polytetrafluoroethylene coatings through nanoscale interface engineering by incorporating polydopamine as an adhesive underlayer and polydopamine coated nanostructures in both the underlayer and coating. This new approach will allow wear-resistant thin polytetrafluoroethylene coatings to be deposited on any substrate materials without changing the underlining surface topography, thus providing potential solutions to retain a wide range of surface properties that rely on both surface topography and chemistry, including, but not limited to, self-cleaning, anti-fogging, anti-icing, anti-corrosion, anti-biofouling, drag reduction, and solid lubrication. These properties are critically important for applications in energy, aerospace, automotive, oil and gas, healthcare, and biomedical industries. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society. Comprehensive education and outreach activities will be implemented which will significantly stimulate the next generation?s interest in nanomaterials and their applications and will improve America?s future competitiveness in nanotechnology.<br/><br/>The objectives of this research are to significantly improve the wear resistance of the polytetrafluoroethylene coatings through: (1) increasing the bonding strength between the polydopamine underlayer and the polytetrafluoroethylene coating and (2) increasing the bonding strength among the polytetrafluoroethylene nanoparticles within the polytetrafluoroethylene coatings.

This research program will establish fundamental understanding of the roles of the polydopamine underlayer and the polydopamine coated nanostructures in improving the wear resistance of the polytetrafluoroethylene coatings for potential surface wetting and tribological applications.

Data from modeling efforts can provide crucial information to decision makers to act against these risks, but available models are limited in scope. Current fragility-based models for flood defense systems are primarily focused on a single mode of failure without consideration of causal relationships and temporal correlations among various failure modes. Failure assessment is treated as a snapshot in time neglecting the time evolution of failure processes. The adoption of surge hydrographs in current methods to independently determine failure probabilities from reliability models neglects the impact of the performance of geo-structures on spatio-temporal surge response. Moreover, we lack an accurate conceptualization of how this informational shortfall impairs decision makers in making critical judgments about storm surge risk and infrastructure investment. This work will provide for the development of the next generation in storm surge and fragility models  and will provide for an experimental validation and assessment of the models' effects on decision making, as follows: 1) Development of an adaptive-resolution storm surge model that responds to the changing state of flood protection systems; 2) Derivation of novel time-dependent, multi-dimensional fragility models of geo-structures, fully integrated with the storm surge model; 3) Development and utilization of human-in-the-loop experimentation to validate and test the effects of these models on real-time decision making, and 4) Creation of enhanced educational and research opportunities for students and teachers, along with dissemination of research knowledge to critical stakeholders. <br/><br/>The research performed under this project will have a significant impact on the development of the next generation of storm surge models that are fully integrated with time-dependent fragility models to improve forecasting capabilities of flooding scenarios. The research will also improve understanding of how decision makers utilize storm risk assessment information to make critical decisions. Ultimately, this research will lead to more informed decisions about catastrophic risk and infrastructure failure (e.g., evacuation decisions, search and rescue operations, infrastructure investment, and pre-, during, and post-event planning). The educational plan will provide for integrated new curriculum in infrastructure modeling, resilience and risk analysis. Moreover, the educational plan will enhance the self-efficacy of K8 teachers to teach engineering in classrooms and help engineering students to develop pedagogical skills. Results will be disseminated to (and validated with) key federal and regional stakeholders (e.g., Dept. of Homeland Security, FEMA, US Coast Guard) as well as industry partners.  The results from this project will provide a significant improvement in storm surge modeling through the development of a novel, dynamically coupled modeling system consisting of hydrodynamic and fragility model components. The stochastic finite difference models combined with machine learning techniques will enable generation of a novel class of multi-dimensional fragility surfaces that will enhance our understanding of various failure processes and characterize time evolution of failure probabilities. The coupled surge/fragility model will adapt the mesh resolution in response to changing conditions of the flood protection systems, resulting in improved forecasting capabilities. The experimental analysis will provide for an assessment of how these modeling capabilities improve real-time decision making."

The goal of this research is to determine whether the ability to reach out and grasp an object enhances visual information that helps people interact more effectively with their immediate surroundings. The research will also assess whether training to grasp objects in novel ways can influence people's visual experience. An enhanced understanding of how the action of grasping might alter visual perception can inform the design of applications for handheld mobile devices such as smartphones and tablets and can help tailor interfaces to enhance user experience and safety. In addition, the project provides opportunities for high school students and Native American college students to become involved in STEM research (through the North Dakota Governor's School program and the NSF-funded NATURE program).<br/><br/>How does the capacity for action shape visual cognition? Observers process objects that are within peripersonal space  (objects they can easily grasp with their hands) differently than objects outside of their reach. A series of psychophysical experiments evaluates the hypothesis that changes in visual processing of graspable objects near the hands reflect an adaptation of the visual system to behavioral contexts. Dr. Thomas will examine how grasp posture creates affordances for action that bias processing of action-relevant visual information. Visual biases associated with power grip and precision grip postures will also be evaluated in situations with differing visual processing task demands. Potential plasticity of alterations in visual processing near the hands will be evaluated by determining whether action-specific training alters how observers process action-relevant visual information. These experiments explore the potential influence of both bottom-up and top-down mechanisms that may contribute to altered vision near the hands and determine the relationships between visual biases associated with the planning of dynamic actions and those associated with static hand postures.  More generally, the work evaluates the malleability of the relationship between body position and visual perception, attention, and memory."

What kinds of properties do these languages share and where do they diverge?  Documenting and studying the intricacies, particularly in syntax (""sentence structure""), increases our understanding of the complex properties in a particular language as well as in closely related languages.  While isolation caused by mountains or bodies of water has been one variable, this study asks these questions in an entirely different context by documenting the speech of a community that went into seclusion in the 16th century.  With rapid change in the area in the linguistic and social landscape, there is urgency to document the language of this isolated area now, while there are still speakers.  Investigating the grammar of such a language variety will show how it is both structurally similar to and different from related languages and contributes to the knowledge of relationships between languages in the same family tree. The project will train University of Iowa graduate and undergraduate students in cutting-edge technologies and methods for language documentation, digital file management, linguistic fieldwork and research methods in the language sciences.  The collection and analysis of a publicly archived, wide variety of language materials will generate data of scholarly interest to other disciplines that depend on language-related material (anthropology, biology, history, geography), while increasing our scientific knowledge of the unique aspects of this language and its relatives.<br/><br/>William Davies of the University of Iowa leads an international collaboration with researchers at Universitas Pendidikan Indonesia, teaming up to document the language of the Baduy Dalam 'Inner Baduy,' a small group of about 1170 living in a remote area on the island of Java in Indonesia. The team will record natural speech (narratives and conversations) and lexical items to produce an audio and video transcribed corpus of Baduy Dalam speech, a dictionary (with special focus on culturally distinctive concepts), and a grammar sketch. Recordings, data files, and field notes will be archived at the University of Iowa and the Pacific and Regional Archive for Digital Sources in Endangered Cultures, where they will be accessible to other researchers and the general public. Broader impacts include producing print and video materials for direct use by the Baduy as linguistic and cultural education resources. Baduy Dalam is of linguistic importance in part due to how its syntax manifests the Austronesian 'voice' system, which involves how predicates (e.g. ""subjects"" and ""objects"") pattern in sentences based on the verb and sentence type. These results will contribute to understanding of the micro-syntactic variation in the Austronesian language family, the second largest language family in the world. The implications are thus important for typology, syntax, and linguistic studies of variation, especially the micro-variations in syntax, which have in many cases focused on larger world languages, like English, or Indo-European language subgroups, like Italian, Spanish and closely related Romance languages. This project will also support international research and training opportunities for a graduate student and it will stimulate new international collaborations between U.S. and Indonesian academic institutions.

From a user's perspective, the main issue is not about storage, or computing power, or large scale data processing. It is more about how to best amplify his or her limited cognition power to make sense of a large data corpus via ""natural"" interactive exploration. This project will undertake the challenge of computer-human interactive exploration of information-rich billion-scale network datasets. These include online social networks (who is connected to whom), online auctions (who is buying what), and intelligence analysis of communication patterns and network traffic. It will blend computer-human interaction principles and decomposable visualizations with new scalable exploration techniques that are driven by information-theoretic measures. Specifically, it will design and develop a prototype system, in which users will gradually build up an understanding of billion-scale network datasets. This research could fundamentally change how people make sense of data in many domains like scientific literature, cybersecurity, and consumer decision making. The findings could increase education effectiveness, rate of scientific discovery, and enable more literate, knowledgeable, and intelligent citizens.<br/><br/>This project will combine multiple novel ideas synergistically, organized into four inter-related research thrusts: (1) Adaptive Local Exploration using Minimum Description Length principles (MDL), KL divergence and Combinatorial Discrepancy. (2) Pattern Tele-Discovery & Global Summarization via algorithmic teleportation tools. These will include mechanisms for querying, discovering, linking, and visualizing multi-attributed time-evolving network patterns. (3) Scalable Data Models & Algorithms to support the interactivity demands of the previous thrusts. The proposed tools will address storage layouts via Egonet Edge Partitions and distributed sparse and persistent multidimensional sorted maps.

Improvements in these methods and software give scientists an even more powerful tool for discovery.  This project will develop new methods and software for quantum chemistry aimed at fully exploiting the parallel capabilities of today's computer hardware.  Parallel capabilities within individual processor cores will be specifically exploited, as well as the ability to use multiple compute nodes concurrently for a single calculation.  Success in this project will promote the progress of science, specifically for efficiently studying very large molecular systems with quantum chemistry tools, by decreasing the computer time needed for studies with the same accuracy and increasing the accuracy of studies that use the same computational time.<br/> <br/>This project will first target the computation of electron repulsion integrals (ERIs) used in essentially all quantum chemistry software.  The calculation of ERIs using the Obara-Saika (OS) method will be reorganized to exploit the single instruction multiple data (SIMD) capabilities of modern computer processors.  The calculation of the Boys function used in the OS method will also be addressed.  An optimized, open source software library for ERI calculation will be released, which will include functionality for one-electron integrals and integral derivatives.  This project will also further develop the GTFock quantum chemistry framework to make it easier to use by adding several interfaces.  GTFock, which has efficient distributed parallel capabilities, will be extended to include symmetry-adapted perturbation theory.  GTFock will be used to study large protein-ligand systems.

Examples include data centers for cloud computing, online advertising systems, electronic chip manufacturing lines, the Internet, and health care service systems. Requests for services from such systems are processed by an interconnected set of resources such as computers, manufacturing stations, and human servers.  In such applications, a common objective is to identify service policies (routing, service order, and server control algorithms) that minimize delays for customers using the system. Except in a few special cases, currently there are no mathematical tools available to compute performance metrics such as the delay experienced by the customers, especially when the system size is large. The goal of this project is to advance the mathematics tools needed to compute performance metrics of large systems of networked resources. These mathematical techniques will enable the design of good service policies for the myriad of applications mentioned earlier. The results from the project will be incorporated into courses. Outreach efforts will be made to include students from underrepresented groups and minorities in the project. <br/><br/>Often the problem of optimal control of networks of interacting resources can be modeled as a Markov Decision Problem (MDP), but the state-space is prohibitively large to obtain optimal solutions. Therefore, it is common to study such problems (under some appropriate scaling) either as fluid control problems, or Brownian control problems, or large-deviations problems. The objective of this project is to enable an alternative approach, which involves studying the drift of appropriately-chosen Lyapunov functions, in transient and steady-state modes. The specific challenge involves developing lower-dimensional models for high-dimensional systems, and using the lower-dimensional models to study the optimality, or lack thereof, of specific architectures and algorithms. If successful, this project will result in (i) new analysis tools based on the drift-based arguments, which provide tight bounds on the steady-state performance of control and decision algorithms in large networks, and (ii) design of optimal or near-optimal algorithms that perform well at all traffic loads."

While such models are adequate for marketing purposes, they often introduce significant errors when used as-is in an engineering design context.

This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award provides support for fundamental research to develop metrics and a test procedure to evaluate various errors associated with customer preference models that can mislead engineering designers. Results will allow engineering designers to construct demand models using estimation methods that minimize errors in design selection and optimization. The metrics developed through this work will also allow practitioners to evaluate demand models and select the most appropriate model for their design problem. In addition, several education and dissemination activities will be conducted to improve student learning of model evaluation techniques and facilitate use of the evaluation methods by federal agencies that employ demand models to inform their funding and regulation of technology development in the transportation sector.<br/><br/>The research objectives are to produce (1) engineering-design specific metrics that will evaluate the estimation biases associated with demand models, (2) a demonstration of the significance of demand-model estimation biases on optimal design variable selection, and (3) identification of one or more demand estimation methods that reduce biases affecting design selection and optimization. The research will draw upon discrete choice analysis and econometric estimation to identify metrics and estimation methods that are appropriate for engineering design. Estimation biases of two types of parameters that affect demand gradients with respect to engineering design variables -- customer preference coefficients and aggregate demand estimates -- will be examined. Multiple metrics will be tested to compare demand-model predictions with synthetic customer purchase data in which biases between the estimates and true parameters are known. Several different demand estimation methods proposed in econometrics will be evaluated using the identified metric(s). Finally, an optimization case study will be used to illustrate the influence of demand model biases on optimal design variables by comparing results using the identified estimation method that reduces parameter biases with one that does not."

The project also involves developing case studies of students' engagement with engineering design practices within each context and comparing students' experiences across contexts. The findings are likely to influence how schools, especially educators, conceptualize Next Generation Science Standard practices, thus opening up these practices to more multifaceted ways of talking, thinking, and engaging and highlighting critical aspects of identity work in these settings. The merit of this project lies in the continued need for research that positively impacts the recruitment and retention of engineering students, particularly from underrepresented communities. By focusing on African American males, the project extends the understandings of the ways in which they may develop engineering practice competencies and identities. Further, the project is likely to contribute to the engineering education community's understanding of the development of engineering identities and the different features within learning environments that foster the formation and transformation of these identities. <br/><br/>The key project objectives are the research and educational activities are the following:(a)examine and characterize the relationship between African American males' engineering practice competencies and identities; (b)examine and characterize elements within engineering learning environments that impact African American males' developing competencies and identities; and (c)develop hypotheses for the design of expansive engineering learning spaces for increasing African American males' competencies and identities. The project is unique in its approach to exploring the complex relationship between students' engineering engagement, learning, and identity formation to understand expansive learning ecologies in engineering for African American males.

Those contributions include the solutions of a number of very famous unsolved problems in mathematics, not only in geometry but also in number theory, topology, and other areas. For example, recent solution of the 100-year-old Poincaré Conjecture relied heavily on methods from geometric analysis and metric geometry. This area of mathematics also has applications to physics, chemistry, engineering, and big data analysis. The conference encourages and supports participation by members of groups underrepresented in mathematics.<br/><br/>The technical areas represented in the conference are global and comparison Riemannian geometry, special Riemannian metrics (Einstein, Ricci solitons, and generalizations), isometric group actions, positive curvature, metric geometry, and Alexandrov geometry. The conference features eight plenary speakers and approximately ten shorter talks by early-career mathematicians. The conference activities will bring together leading experts and young researchers and students, facilitating the dissemination of recent research progress and discussion of future directions and open problems. These interactions are expected to lead to cross-fertilization between the more specialized topics presented at the conference and to future progress in both geometric analysis and metric geometry.

While this has created many new opportunities, the materials and the properties available with 3D printing are still much more limited than those available with traditional processes such as machining and injection molding. This award supports fundamental research to enable expansion of the range and functionality of materials used in 3D printing processes that form components by locally heating (sintering) a polymer powder (usually with a laser). As the range of available materials expands, the processes can be used more widely. The continued expansion of additive manufacturing through improved material properties, increased variety of materials, and reduced production costs, will help achieve the full benefits of additive manufacturing including low-cost customized products, faster development times, and more personalized medicine. <br/><br/>Additive manufacturing via sintering of polymer powders has typically used a scanning laser to heat the materials quickly. The tightly focused laser creates large thermal gradients and short sintering times.  Relatively few materials can densify reliably without degradation under these conditions.  A single material (nylon 12) composes a large majority of all polymer-sintered components. However, a solution may be to use lower intensity light for longer time.  Build rate may be maintained or improved by heating larger areas using large laser spot sizes or by sintering an entire layer with a single exposure.  Longer processing times will require a transition from process characterization based on energy input to temperature history.  The objective of this research is to understand the effects of sintering time, temperature, and area in polymer sintering.  This will be done by modeling process outcomes based on processing temperature and time, rather than optical energy input--enabling application of viscous sintering theory to guide process development. Viscosity and sintering rates of test materials will be measured to calibrate sintering models while stiffness, strength, and viscosity measurements of heated materials will be used to identify the processing window which avoids degradation. A projection-sintering system will be developed to measure sintering outcomes (porosity, stiffness, and strength) with varying exposure time, temperature, and area.  Models will be developed to identify combinations of processing time and temperature that achieve equivalent material properties.  These models will be used to predict tradeoffs in material properties, build rate, and resolution between alternative machine architectures using point, line, and area-based heating methods. They will also accelerate selection and development of new polymer sintering materials."

Examples include electricity demand response programs, ground and air transportation systems, data center power management, robotic networks, among others. The goal of this project is to establish new control and game theoretic foundations, along with numerical algorithms, to enable formal and scalable design of hierarchical population control systems. <br/><br/>In contrast to the existing literature that primarily focuses on static strategic agents, this project will consider both strategic and non-strategic agents with nontrivial dynamics. The project involves three tasks. (i) First, it will establish control theoretic foundations for hierarchical population control of non-strategic agents (HPCN). Each non-strategic agent is associated with a predefined local response rule and is modeled as a hybrid system. A novel approach based on abstraction of stochastic hybrid systems (SHS) will be investigated to solve the HPCN problem. (ii) The project will also develop a uniform-price dynamic mechanism design framework for hierarchical population control of strategic agents (HPCS).  The framework is based the near-Nash equilibrium concept that can facilitate the analysis of the game-theoretic population behaviors. Advanced bi-level optimization algorithms will also be developed to address the computational challenges associated with the proposed mechanism design approach.

A human action does not occur in isolation, and it is not the only thing recorded in a video sequence. A video clip of a human action also contains many other components, including the background scene, the interacting objects, the camera motion, and the activity of other people. Some of these components are contextual elements that frequently co-occur with the category of action in consideration. The project develops technologies that separated human actions from co-occurring factors for large-scale recognition and fine-grain visual interpretation of human actions. The developed technologies can have many practical applications in a wide range of fields, ranging from human computer interaction and robotics to security and health-care. <br/> <br/>This research develops an approach to human action recognition by explicitly factorizing human actions from context. The key idea is to exploit the benefits of the information from conjugate samples of human actions. A conjugate sample is defined as a video clip that is contextually similar to an action sample, but does not contain the action. For instance, a conjugate sample of a handshake sample can be the video sequence showing two people approaching each other prior to the handshake. The handshake clip and the video sequence preceding it have many similar or even the same contextual elements, including the people, the background scene, the camera angle, and the lighting condition. The only thing that sets these two video clips apart is the actual human action itself. A conjugate sample provides complementary information to the action sample; it can be used to suppress contextual irrelevance and magnify the action signal. The specific research objectives of this project include: (1) collecting human action samples for many action classes; (2) developing algorithms to mine and extract conjugate human action samples; and (3) developing a framework that utilizes the benefits of conjugate samples for separating actions from context to learn classifiers for large-scale recognition and fine-grain understanding of human actions."

Cloud services are well-positioned to help application providers reduce users' latency by serving users from hundreds of locations across the world that have rich and diverse Internet connectivity to users' networks. However, due to various sources of inefficiency, web service performance in practice often falls well short of the potential that cloud-based deployments offer. For example, many users are incorrectly served from distant servers. Even when served from a nearby server, performance can be degraded due to circuitous routing or congestion. These suboptimal outcomes stem from the limited interface between applications and cloud providers to express goals and achieve outcomes, and often a mismatch in their goals.<br/><br/>This project pursues a multi-pronged cross-layer approach to enable cloud services to optimize the performance offered by web services they host. First, the researchers will develop a new approach for directing clients to nearby servers, combining the strengths of existing approaches in order to overcome their weaknesses. Part of this research will also include an investigation of how to jointly optimize client-to-server redirection and back-end data placement in order to satisfy end-to-end performance objectives. Second, this project will involve large-scale studies of web transport performance and anomalies in order to inform the design of low-latency transport protocols. Lastly, the researchers will design a system to allow cloud tenants to take advantage of the rich interdomain routing available to cloud providers, in order to best balance diverse performance and cost constraints. Thus, this project will synthesize various inter-dependent aspects of running a high performance web service.<br/><br/>The researchers will collaborate with the providers of popular cloud services to have a transformative effect on industrial practice and enable real-world impact. By developing solutions for cloud providers to deploy for all applications they host, this project will benefit application providers without them having to build and deploy these solutions themselves. Where applicable, the researchers will also deploy prototypes of their systems on the NSF-funded PEERING and CloudLab testbeds, which other researchers can use to build their own experimental applications.

This is particularly challenging for groups with very large numbers of species, especially when they are difficult to observe because they grow in hard to reach places.  Tropical trees are among the most under-studied plants, creating a significant gap in our knowledge.  To overcome this gap, an efficient and effective strategy is needed to discover, describe, understand and conserve this large and important part of the world's biodiversity.  This research project will develop a streamlined strategy, using the genus Schefflera (a member of the ivy family, Araliaceae) in tropical America as a model group.  More than 400 species of Schefflera occur in this vast region, especially in the very mountainous areas of the northern Andes.  Many of these species have only been seen by scientists once or a few times, and almost half do not yet have scientific names.  Moreover, very few tools are available to recognize and identify these ecologically important plants, and we know almost nothing about how they evolved into so many different forms, or how they were able to adapt to the wide range of habitats.

This is particularly challenging for groups with very large numbers of species, especially when they are difficult to observe because they grow in hard to reach places.  Tropical tree genera with many species are among the most under-studied plant groups, creating a significant gap in our knowledge.  To overcome this gap, an efficient and effective strategy is needed to discover, describe, understand and conserve this large and important part of the world's biodiversity.  This research project will develop a streamlined strategy, using the genus Schefflera (a member of the ivy family, Araliaceae) in tropical America as a model group.  More than 400 species of Schefflera occur in this vast region, especially in the very mountainous areas of the northern Andes.  Many of these species have only been seen by scientists once or a few times, and almost half do not yet have scientific names.  Moreover, very few tools are available to recognize and identify these ecologically important plants, and we know almost nothing about how they evolved into so many different forms, or how they were able to adapt to the wide range of habitats.  The strategy of this study, which includes field work in four Andean countries (Bolivia, Colombia, Ecuador and Peru), aims to improve our understanding of these evolutionary processes.

Historically, increasingly powerful X-ray sources led to great leaps in the ability to obtain information about structures of biomolecules, which is critically related to the molecules' biological function. The first X-ray free electron laser (XFEL) came online in 2009 at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, granting researchers the unprecedented ability to see the detailed atomic arrangements in, and movements of, biological molecules in their natural state (i.e. warm and wet). Serial femtosecond crystallography (SFX), a novel extension of crystallography making use of the extreme flux and ultra-short duration of XFEL pulses, has produced new insights into fundamentally important processes such as photosynthesis, helping to understand how plants and bacteria convert sunlight into energy and create the oxygen we breathe, making life possible on earth, as well as improving human health by aiding pharmaceutical drug design, for example guiding improvements in pain killers and blood pressure regulators. However, XFEL experiments with biological targets typically require very large volumes of data and thus a correspondingly large volume of scarce, precious protein, to obtain high-resolution molecular structures. Furthermore, XFEL facilities typically host only one or two experiments simultaneously, and only two XFELs presently serve the global user community, while more will be coming online in 2017. The number of biological targets that can be studied and the rate of discoveries can be dramatically increased through the development of innovative, advanced algorithms that reduce the number of necessary measurements and extract more information from the samples by fully exploiting the information content that is unique to XFEL diffraction, and by extending XFEL use to uncrystallized targets. <br/><br/>This project has three main objectives: (a) explore algorithms for improving data accuracy in XFEL serial femtosecond crystallography through modeling and optimization (beyond the Monte Carlo approach for data merging), (b) explore and develop novel phasing methods which exploit the full spatial coherence of the XFEL for 2D and 3D nanocrystals, and (c) develop structure-determination methods that can be applied to samples that cannot be crystallized, through XFEL fast solution scattering (FSS). FSS can provide dynamic structural information from ""snapshot"" diffraction from particles that can be studied dynamically in solution, broadening the range of samples suitable for XFELs. Further development of this approach to include statistical intensity correlations that are unique to XFEL measurements can potentially displace the need for crystal growth altogether. These new algorithms, which will be freely available to the scientific community, will increase accessibility and applicability of the revolutionary capabilities of XFELs for biological imaging by significantly decreasing the amount of sample, data and experimental time (and therefore overall costs) necessary to obtain high-resolution structures. Thus the project will contribute directly to improved understanding of the fundamental biomolecular mechanisms by providing time-resolved images of molecular machines at work.

This contradiction stems from the crucial role of phosphorus for the growth of all biological organisms, plants and animals. As a rate-limiting nutrient, excess phosphorus in the environment is responsible for eutrophication, the leading cause of freshwater impairment. Conversely, phosphorus is vital to global food security as it sustains high agricultural productivity. Worst-case estimates suggest that rapidly diminishing mineable phosphorus reserves could be depleted beyond the realm of economically feasible extraction within a century. In the face of this looming crisis, the recovery of ""waste"" phosphorus from wastewater and environmental surface waters is no longer a luxury, but an urgent imperative that is the focus of this project.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, conventional wastewater treatment is incapable of satisfying new sustainability metrics of capturing phosphorus at low levels and recovering it as a valuable resource. Therefore, the overarching project objective is to elucidate the fundamentals of phosphorus-specific high affinity phosphate-binding protein and evaluate phosphorus removal and recovery efficiency. This is directly relevant to the principal investigator's (PI's) career trajectory as it integrates nutrient recovery, environmental microbiology, sustainability, and STEM education. The pursuit of mutually reinforcing research and educational objectives establishes a strong foundation for the PI's future portfolio of research discoveries and educational advancements. The proposed research will provide the first exploration of phosphorus-specific high affinity phosphate-binding protein in the context of phosphorus sorption and desorption for controlled phosphorus recovery applications. The study will elucidate the fundamental basis of phosphorus-specific high affinity phosphate-binding protein and quantify phosphorus removal and recovery using two protein-based systems: 1) E. coli bacteria engineered to surface-express phosphorus-specific high affinity phosphate-binding protein, and 2) phosphorus-specific high affinity phosphate-binding protein immobilized on synthetic media. Preliminary data indicate that phosphorus-specific high affinity phosphate-binding protein can remove phosphorus, but basic research is needed to improve understanding of the basis of phosphorus-specific high affinity phosphate-binding protein binding and its phosphorus recovery potential. By enhancing the fundamental scientific understanding of phosphorus-specific high affinity phosphate-binding protein capabilities, this project will substantially advance sustainable treatment in the context of the joint criteria of phosphorus removal and recovery. This work is novel in that, for the first time, the potential for controlled phosphorus removal and recovery using immobilized and surface-displayed phosphorus-specific high affinity phosphate-binding protein systems in both water and wastewater will be investigated. The proposed research advances broader societal outcomes, including improved understanding of sustainable technologies; increased minority participation in STEM; and development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce. The results will foster development and evaluation of sustainable biomimicry-inspired technologies for phosphorus recovery. This effort has broader implications for environmental water quality, wastewater infrastructure, mining, global food security, and associated economic and sociopolitical implications."

These multi-emitting molecules can be developed into components of energy-efficient, light-emitting materials.  This project lies at the interface of organic, physical, and materials chemistry, and is therefore well suited to the education of scientists at all levels across disciplines in chemistry.  This research group is ethnically and culturally diverse, which is also well-positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science.

The goal of this project is to understand the fundamental molecular photophysics of novel multi-state organic fluorophores.  By doing so, means to control the overall brightness and color mixing of a multi-fluorescence profile can be developed to afford, for example, white light emission.  Bright, near-white light-emitting fluorophores are assessed for their potential utility in electroluminescence-based energy-efficient lighting devices.  Fluorophores that are capable of rapid intra- or intermolecular proton transfer either in the excited or the ground state (i.e., proton transfer dyes) are the specific multi-state fluorophores under investigation in this application.  The photophysical properties of these compounds are studied by quantum mechanical calculations, steady-state and ultrafast time-resolved spectroscopies.  If successful, new fluorescent compounds with utility in white light-emitting materials will be identified."

Cloud services are well-positioned to help application providers reduce users' latency by serving users from hundreds of locations across the world that have rich and diverse Internet connectivity to users' networks. However, due to various sources of inefficiency, web service performance in practice often falls well short of the potential that cloud-based deployments offer. For example, many users are incorrectly served from distant servers. Even when served from a nearby server, performance can be degraded due to circuitous routing or congestion. These suboptimal outcomes stem from the limited interface between applications and cloud providers to express goals and achieve outcomes, and often a mismatch in their goals.<br/><br/>This project pursues a multi-pronged cross-layer approach to enable cloud services to optimize the performance offered by web services they host. First, the researchers will develop a new approach for directing clients to nearby servers, combining the strengths of existing approaches in order to overcome their weaknesses. Part of this research will also include an investigation of how to jointly optimize client-to-server redirection and back-end data placement in order to satisfy end-to-end performance objectives. Second, this project will involve large-scale studies of web transport performance and anomalies in order to inform the design of low-latency transport protocols. Lastly, the researchers will design a system to allow cloud tenants to take advantage of the rich interdomain routing available to cloud providers, in order to best balance diverse performance and cost constraints. Thus, this project will synthesize various inter-dependent aspects of running a high performance web service.<br/><br/>The researchers will collaborate with the providers of popular cloud services to have a transformative effect on industrial practice and enable real-world impact. By developing solutions for cloud providers to deploy for all applications they host, this project will benefit application providers without them having to build and deploy these solutions themselves. Where applicable, the researchers will also deploy prototypes of their systems on the NSF-funded PEERING and CloudLab testbeds, which other researchers can use to build their own experimental applications.

The objective of this project is to enable an alternative approach, which involves studying the drift of appropriately-chosen Lyapunov functions, in transient and steady-state modes. The specific challenge involves developing lower-dimensional models for high-dimensional systems, and using the lower-dimensional models to study the optimality, or lack thereof, of specific architectures and algorithms.

If successful, this research will have profound implications in our discipline and for the society at large. Current planning models might produce suboptimal results, because they rely on detailed origin-destination tables that may be impossible to estimate reliably, and traffic dynamics that must be simplified such that they do not adequately capture the characteristics of congestion. The proposed theory overcomes these deficiencies by employing a macroscopic approach whose results are consistent with microscopic traffic dynamics. The proposed theory enables large-scale field implementations of congestion-saving control strategies for big metropolitan areas. These strategies are robust, and independent of both origin-destination tables and of the details of the road network. This project will enhance the educational and research infrastructure by making available large amounts of empirical data and software tools for their analysis and for simulation. <br/><br/>This project will seek to validate and expand the hypothesis that the Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram of an urban network, which gives average travel time as a function of average density, depends mainly on the proposed three parameters. To test this hypothesis, the research will employ empirical data from different cities around the world. The analytical framework from prior NSF-funded research will be expanded to understand the conditions where this theory is applicable. This will shed light on the effects in macroscopic network performance of traffic signal control, route choice models and congestion pricing.  Stochastic processes techniques will be employed to generate bounds to approximate network capacity reductions due to short blocks, which has proved difficult in the past. The project will develop the concept of macroscopic dynamic traffic assignment by formulating the assignment problem and its solution through a partition of the network into a collection of subnetworks, each described by a Macroscopic Fundamental Diagram. Closed form solutions will be sought for simple configurations, which will be the building blocks to develop numerical algorithms to tackle general networks. This will allow the computation of congestion control strategies, traffic state estimation and forecast over large urban networks and in real-time, all of which is intractable with current methods."

From a user's perspective, the main issue is not about storage, or computing power, or large scale data processing. It is more about how to best amplify his or her limited cognition power to make sense of a large data corpus via ""natural"" interactive exploration. This project will undertake the challenge of computer-human interactive exploration of information-rich billion-scale network datasets. These include online social networks (who is connected to whom), online auctions (who is buying what), and intelligence analysis of communication patterns and network traffic. It will blend computer-human interaction principles and decomposable visualizations with new scalable exploration techniques that are driven by information-theoretic measures. Specifically, it will design and develop a prototype system, in which users will gradually build up an understanding of billion-scale network datasets. This research could fundamentally change how people make sense of data in many domains like scientific literature, cybersecurity, and consumer decision making. The findings could increase education effectiveness, rate of scientific discovery, and enable more literate, knowledgeable, and intelligent citizens.<br/><br/>This project will combine multiple novel ideas synergistically, organized into four inter-related research thrusts: (1) Adaptive Local Exploration using Minimum Description Length principles (MDL), KL divergence and Combinatorial Discrepancy. (2) Pattern Tele-Discovery & Global Summarization via algorithmic teleportation tools. These will include mechanisms for querying, discovering, linking, and visualizing multi-attributed time-evolving network patterns. (3) Scalable Data Models & Algorithms to support the interactivity demands of the previous thrusts. The proposed tools will address storage layouts via Egonet Edge Partitions and distributed sparse and persistent multidimensional sorted maps.

In particular, the use of lipid vesicles or liposomes as nanoscale drug carriers has resulted in significant advances toward the treatment of a range of cancers. However, the transition of liposomal nanomedicines from the lab to the clinic remains constrained by the lack of nanomanufacturing methods capable of scaling across the full production range. This award will investigate continuous-flow microfluidics technology as a unique scalable approach to bridge this gap. This technology will leverage chemical and physical phenomena across multiple size scales within a continuous-flow microfluidic system, resulting in nanoparticle self-assembly, passive and active drug loading, nanoparticle functionalization, and drug purification and concentration. Individual fluidic modules will be developed and optimized, and sequential modules will be combined in a single continuous-flow nanofactory. The multidisciplinary project will integrate contributions from high school students through graduate researchers, and result in development of a new nanomedicines designed for the treatment of recurrent pediatric neuroblastoma, a high-risk cancer with dismal clinical outcomes.<br/><br/>Current techniques for liposomal drug synthesis must be re-engineered at each production scale, introducing manufacturing costs and engineering challenges that present significant barriers to the development of new liposomal drugs. Overcoming this gap is fundamentally a nanomanufacturing challenge. We will develop a multistage microfluidic flow focusing technology as a highly scalable method supporting the full production of liposomal nanomedicines in a continuous-flow process. The studies will yield new insights into the underlying multiscale physics for each processing stage, resulting in improved understanding of the chemophysical processes involved in liposome self-assembly, drug loading, and targeting agent attachment within the microfluidic system. The work will also result in new solutions to the key engineering challenges associated with coupling diverse continuous-flow microfluidic modules for advanced functionalized nanoparticle manufacturing. Performance of the technology will be evaluated using a novel nanomedicine test-bed. Specifically, the award will demonstrate a targeted polypharmaceutical comprising of an amphipathic chemotherapeutic (doxorubicin) together with a lipophilic tyrosine kinase inhibitor (erlotinib) for the treatment of pediatric neuroblastoma. Using this test-bed, a combination of scale-up and scale-out will be explored to provide a unified framework for multi-scale liposomal drug synthesis, vastly increasing the speed and reducing the complexity of nanomedicine manufacturing."

Most current additive manufacturing technologies accumulate material in a layer-by-layer process. Recently, layerless additive manufacturing techniques based on vat processing have been suggested. Advantages include faster processing speed, smoother surfaces and better part quality using layerless techniques.  However, processing speed and part quality are critical challenges for producing parts with relatively wide solid cross sections. This award supports fundamental research to provide new knowledge for layerless additive manufacturing of arbitrary 3D objects with wide solid cross sections. The establishment of a fast, layerless additive manufacturing process would enable the production of part shapes and sizes beyond trusses or shells. The research involves multiple disciplines of physics, surface science, microfluidics and manufacturing technology and will contribute new knowledge to advanced manufacturing.  The research will have significant impact on a large number of minority students and enhance STEM education.<br/><br/>Continuous Liquid Interface Production is a layerless additive manufacturing technology based on vat photopolymerization that can achieve build speeds 25 to 100 times faster than layer-by-layer photopolymerization.

This grant will establish a fundamental understanding of the manufacturing process by investigating the resin flow-curing dynamics. The research team will perform liquid-gel-solid multi-phase modeling to understand the resin flow, explore new window designs to accelerate resin replenishment, and establish new light delivery strategies to coordinate resin flow and curing processes.  This research will test the hypothesis that the integration of a textured window and a gradient light delivery strategy will enable continuous printing of arbitrary objects with wide solid cross sections."

This method of study originated in questions around the philosophy and foundations of mathematics, but in recent years it has found striking applications in the study of some central objects of classical mathematics and computer science. This project investigates further these connections, in particular in the context of graphs (mathematical ways of describing networks and related systems) and group actions (mathematical ways of describing collections of symmetries of a space). This study has the potential to open up a route for applications of the powerful infinitary model-theoretic machinery to open questions in finite graph combinatorics, and conversely for applications of deep results in combinatorics to open questions in model theory.<br/><br/>Motivated by Morley's conjecture on the possible number of uncountable models of first-order theories, Shelah isolated several important classes of ""tame"" theories and developed a rich machinery for analyzing models and definable sets for some of those classes, particularly for stable theories. Later work by many researchers demonstrated that notions and methods of generalized stability reflect important phenomena in other areas of mathematics. This project will investigate two such connections. 1) Improved Ramsey-type bounds and strong regularity lemmas were obtained for semi-algebraic graphs by Fox et al. and for algebraic graphs in large finite fields by Tao, with numerous applications in the corresponding areas. These results can naturally be viewed as results about graphs definable in certain structures fitting into the classification picture. 2) Study of definable group actions turns out to be closely related to certain questions in topological dynamics, especially around weakly almost periodic dynamical systems and tame systems studied by Glasner and others. The investigator will work on developing further methods of generalized stability and applying them to questions in combinatorics of graphs definable in various ""tame"" structures (stable, o-minimal, distal, dependent) and to study dynamical properties of definable group actions in those structures."

For example, in the recent recession, Black Americans had a decrease in household wealth that was much greater than that of Whites. Although widening disparities that occur during recessions are frequently explained in terms of existing structural inequalities, recent findings by Amy R. Krosch, in collaboration with the investigator David M. Amodio, suggests  a psychological basis for disparities. Their work indicates that perception of economic scarcity affects visual perception processes such that those from minority racial groups are perceived as more stereotypical in appearance, and in turn, as less deserving of resources. Such findings suggest that economic events can threaten intergroup relations and increase discrimination, putting particular groups at acute risk. However, the psychological mechanisms by which these macroeconomic factors affect racial perceptions is not understood. Understanding such mechanisms is essential for developing ways to reduce the effects of economic scarcity on prejudice and discrimination.<br/><br/>The current project focuses on key sociocognitive mechanisms through which perceptions of economic scarcity cause biased visual perceptions of individuals from racial minority groups. In a series of eight experiments, the investigator tests the hypothesis that perceived scarcity induces not only stereotyping, but dehumanization processes as well: reduced tendency to infer uniquely human-like traits and emotions from a face and to neurally encode it as a human face. Experiments test whether these processes directly bias perceivers' visual representations of individuals from racial minority groups, which, in turn, propagates behavioral discrimination. This research builds on both classic and novel theories of how economic factors influence intergroup relations, and it makes innovative use of behavioral, neuroscientific, and psychophysical methodologies to examine the visual processing of race. This research aims to gain crucial knowledge of how economic factors contribute to persisting disparities and provide some direction for how these effects may be mitigated."

It models OSN threats by viewing an OSN as a graph embedded with attacker nodes and edges, identifies and analyzes specific forms of frauds and attacks, and evaluates state-of-the-art attack analysis and defense approaches.  It develops a spectral-analysis-based framework for OSN fraud and attack detection.  The framework transforms topological information of an OSN graph into patterns formed by spectral coordinates in the spectral space, and introduces the use of the spectral graph perturbation theory to more easily model and capture changes of spectral coordinates for attacker, victim, and regular nodes.  Further, this research develops spectral-analysis-based detection approaches for complex networks where nodes can carry attributes and edges can be negative, weighted, or asymmetric.  Through a novel combination of the network dynamics and the vector autoregressive model, it develops an automatic spectral-analysis-based approach to detecting dynamic attacks while avoiding the high cost and low accuracy of traditional approaches.  It also transforms attack characteristics from high-dimensional spectral spaces into distinctive visual patterns, and develops interactive mechanisms for analysts to incorporate domain knowledge and flexibly handle attacks.  The research team will build a simulation framework to evaluate the detection approaches against different types of OSN attacks, where one can plug in different OSN datasets to evaluate and compare different detection approaches.  Moreover, the research team will build a prototype oSAFARI on top of an OSN, and evaluate how oSAFARI can withstand various attacks in a real setting."

This project will aim to test the evolvability hypothesis by collecting data on fish body shape using museum collections and crowdsourcing. The researchers will digitize a vast store of biodiversity in museum collections to be made available online, for use by the public and interested researchers.<br/><br/>This project will (1) build the largest phylogeny of vertebrates, with over 12,000 species represented, (2) digitize ichthyology collections at three museums, (3) collect the largest geometric morphometric dataset, consisting of shape data for over 9,000 species of fishes, and (4) reconstruct the disparity among different fish lineages, and how their rates of body shape evolution have changed over time. Several key macroevolutionary predictions can be made based on differential evolvability across clades. More evolvable lineages should have higher richness and diversification rates, and enjoy more phenotypic disparity and rates of phenotypic evolution. Additionally, lineages that enjoy fast phenotypic evolution should also diversify into a larger variety of ecological niches."

Incorporation of this nature-inspired structural interplay into synthetic polymeric systems is proposed toward the development of mechanically-robust and functional materials.  Their structures and properties will be studied and correlated in this project using a combination of advanced instrumentation.  The ability to control and tune the molecular and materials architecture in complex systems addresses key scientific challenges related to mechanically adaptive behavior and controlled transport in new materials development. Such systems have potential use in a range of applications, including biomedical delivery vehicles, sensors, actuators, and membranes, and may potentially also offer advantages in terms of processability.  <br/><br/>Graduate and undergraduate students will gain exposure to cross-cutting research -- from synthesis to processing -- and utilize these advances in the areas of mentorship and community outreach. A mentoring platform for female students and post-docs, particularly from underrepresented groups, to engage in dialogue regarding shared experiences and career pathways will be supported. An expanded partnership with a K-12 all-female independent school will provide hands-on demonstrations, career development, and safety/ethics training during a two-week science/engineering exposure program for high-school girls. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Supramolecular associations have been widely explored in elastomers, blends, and copolymer systems, and have motivated interest in the utilization of dynamic associations in the design of interpenetrating polymer networks (IPNs). IPNs provide a robust platform to explore the role of supramolecular motifs as a toughening mechanism due to the intimate interaction of the polymer phases. This research program will elucidate structural parameters and guiding principles to direct fabrication of supramolecular IPNs with tunable interfacial interactions, tailored structural heterogeneity, and synergistic mechanical behavior. Three classes of supramolecular IPNs will be explored that utilize: (1) complementary and orthogonal supramolecular associations with focus on how motifs of varying interaction strength/organization influence microstructure development and dynamics, (2) self-complementary and complementary hydrogen bonding associations with an emphasis on the correlation between the resulting IPN morphology, mechanics, and supramolecular response, and (3) particulate-reinforcement as an approach to control phase coarsening, mechanical behavior, and functionality. A full suite of structural, thermal, mechanical, and morphological characterization techniques will be utilized, including variable temperature nuclear magnetic resonance, fluorescence spectroscopy, tensile testing, dynamic mechanical analysis, atomic force microscopy, rheology, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray and neutron scattering."

Examples include the degree of a polynomial and the number of holes of a surface. The goal of this project is develop general methods to obtain a detailed understanding of nonnegative integer invariants arising in several different areas of mathematics. This may form the foundation for developments in quantum information theory, knot theory, physics, and signal processing.  In particular, this project offers potential new insights into the tensor decomposition problem, which is essentially the problem of recovering individual signals from a mixture of signals and has applications in medicine, computer vision, chemistry, and fast matrix multiplication.<br/><br/>Positivity problems in algebraic combinatorics ask to find positive combinatorial formulae for nonnegative quantities arising in geometry and representation theory. The goal of this project is to develop tools to solve positivity problems arising in two areas of active research, Macdonald theory and geometric complexity theory. Macdonald polynomials are a two-parameter family of symmetric polynomials, which have ties to many areas including geometry, physics, and knot theory. A major breakthrough in this area came with the proof of the Macdonald positivity conjecture, which showed that important structure coefficients related to Macdonald polynomials are nonnegative. It remains a fundamental open question to give a positive combinatorial interpretation of these coefficients. Geometric complexity theory is an approach to P versus NP and related problems in complexity theory using algebraic geometry and representation theory.  A fundamental problem in representation theory, believed to be important for this approach, is the Kronecker problem, which asks for a positive combinatorial formula for decomposing the tensor product of two irreducible representations of the symmetric group into irreducibles. This project will further develop the theory of noncommutative Schur functions, a powerful tool for solving positivity problems, particularly focusing on applications to Macdonald polynomials and the Kronecker problem."

Simplifying and solving these systems (which means reducing the number or complexity of the equations, and finding inputs that satisfy all equations) are fundamental to applications in many areas, including cellular biology, approximation for chemical reaction systems, combinatorics, and analysis.  The theoretical and algorithmic study of such systems spans more than a century, using three methods: purely symbolic, numerical, and hybrid symbolic-numeric.  <br/><br/>Symbolic methods (the quadratic formula being the simplest example) give the strongest guarantees of reliability, at a high (even exorbitant) cost in computational time and memory, since the same algorithm solves both mathematically hard and easy instances.  Numerical methods (the basis for computational simulation) allow small errors or approximations for speed; small intermediate errors produce corrupted outputs on singular and ill-conditioned (that is, nearly singular) input instances. In this project, a hybrid symbolic-numeric approach will be developed. Hybrid algorithms are more adaptive and have lower complexity than symbolic algorithms, and can avoid the errors of numerical algorithms.<br/><br/>In more technical detail, the three investigators apply existing and develop new methods of symbolic-numeric computation and differential algebra, producing algorithms that run on all inputs. They bring together existing methods of numerical algebraic geometry and software packages, such as Bertini, with recent theoretical results in differential algebra that provide upper bounds needed for guaranteed results. New near-optimal root isolation techniques are developed, implemented, and applied to solve systems of differential equations with finitely many solutions.  The work spans from theory to producing practical tools.<br/><br/>As part of this project the three investigators mentor and train students in symbolic and numeric computation at CUNY (noted for serving minority and low-income students) and NYU, and more broadly in New York City and Long Island, by activities ranging from  developing a Symbolic-Numeric Computing course for graduate students at the Computer Science program of the CUNY Graduate Center and NYU, to advising high school students in projects."

The DLC was founded on the principle that the study of lemurs and related primates can inform larger questions in biology such as the genetic and biological underpinnings of the human condition.  Investigators and students from around the world come to Duke to study the living and fossil collections of the DLC.  The DLC serves as a unique center for scientific inquiry, a hub for student activity, a nexus of knowledge, and a global partner for understanding and mitigating the Earth's escalating environmental challenges.  Founded on the unifying themes of scientific inquiry, scholarship, information, and global engagement, the DLC will capitalize on recent revolutions in genomics, informatics and nanotechnology to make possible much more detailed investigation of its endangered primates and the application of these approaches for enhancing public knowledge of the scientific process. The DLC serves multiple educational communities, including the general public, K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and postgraduate students.  A multitude of opportunities exist for engagement at the undergraduate and graduate student levels.  In the past five years alone, more than 400 students from 98 institutions have engaged in research and/or training activities.  <br/>	<br/>Lemurs are endemic to the biodiversity hotspot of Madagascar, and due to their critically-endangered status, it would be impossible to recreate the taxonomic diversity of the DLC colony that presently contains 19 species.  Over the past five-year period, 276 research projects led by 208 investigators from 100 institutions representing eight countries (primarily the U.S.) have been conducted at the DLC. These projects span a broad array of biological disciplines including, but not limited to, aging, behavioral ecology, biomechanics, cognition, epigenetics, life-history strategy, metabolomics, metagenomics, molecular evolution, neurophysiology, phylogeography, phylogenomics, population genetics, reproductive biology, sensory communication, speciation, and virology.  During this three year project, the DLC will continue to make lemurs readily available to investigators, along with extensive collections of biological samples, decades of medical records, fossil representatives of extinct taxa, and rich life-history records.  The DLC will also release a new version of the mouse lemur genome assembly, which will further enhance the research potential of the mouse lemur colony specifically, and the entire DLC colony by phylogenetic extension. In addition, the DLC will collaborate with Duke University's Center for In Vivo Microscopy, continue in vivo and ex vivo studies to produce an online multidimensional neural atlas of the dwarf and mouse lemurs.  The DLC is also wholeheartedly committed to conservation activities via both ex situ captive management and in-country programs. The DLC's conservation Initiative in Madagascar has already served as a ""landing pad"" for numerous student and faculty researchers engaged in projects ranging from disease transmission, to behavioral ecology, to ecophysiology, to climate change.  On-line access to colony inventories, demographics, metadata, research opportunities, and more is available through two web-based portals.

The basic coloring problem is to find such a partition with the fewest color classes. Coloring deals with the fundamental problem of partitioning a set of objects into classes that avoid certain conflicts. This model has many applications, for example, in time tabling, scheduling, frequency assignment, and sequencing problems. The theory of graph coloring is among central topics in discrete mathematics. It relates to other important areas of combinatorics, such as Ramsey theory, graph minors, independence number, orientations of graphs, and packing of graphs. Coloring properties of graphs certainly heavily depend on the cycle structure of these graphs. The goal of this project is to study a series of extremal problems related to colorings of graphs and hypergraphs, where answers depend on the cycle structure. The plan is to make significant advances in developing the theory of graph and hypergraph coloring and studying their cycle structure. The project involves a number of graduate students and young researchers. <br/><br/>The main directions of study are planned to be color-critical graphs with small average degree, list coloring, improper colorings, equitable coloring, bounds on the independence number, hypergraph coloring, existence of cycles of specified length in graphs with high chromatic number, Turan-type problems on cycles in graphs and hypergraphs, existence of many disjoint cycles in dense graphs, packing, and list packing. Work in these directions will exploit and possibly develop recent advances in the field including the results of the investigator and collaborators, in particular, graduate students working with him. Among promising tools are the language of potentials and the notion of list packing. Among expected results are enhancements of classical results on disjoint cycles and on the longest cycles in graphs with restrictions on the vertex degrees."

Large numbers of species are transported globally through international trade and human traffic. Non-native species invade myriad habitats that include natural areas, agricultural landscapes, and timber forests, altering natural ecological communities, reducing ecosystem services, and causing economic losses that are estimated at up to billions of dollars annually. Damages and costs increase further as invasive species spread across larger regions. Understanding the conditions that facilitate and prevent range expansion are critical to both predicting the spread of invasive species and informing species conservation efforts. At species range edges, natural and human-assisted movement interplay with local population dynamics in complex ways to determine spread dynamics. This project centers on a fundamental question: What are the drivers of species range expansion and how do multiple processes interact to shape invasion patterns? Researchers will address this question by studying the invasion pattern of an infamous North American invader, the gypsy moth. The gypsy moth periodically defoliates large tracts of hardwood forest, negatively affecting ecological communities, timber production, and recreational activities. The gypsy moth invasion front stretches from Minnesota to North Carolina and is expanding at an average rate of approximately 10 kilometers per year. Knowledge gaps filled by this project will inform management and conservation strategies to ultimately reduce the environmental and economic costs of non-native invaders and maintain biodiversity in the United States.<br/><br/>The researchers will use an exhaustive spatiotemporal dataset that annually quantifies the 2000 km long range edge of the gypsy moth.

The proposed research tests hypotheses associated with three main objectives: 1) quantify effects of landscape features and spatial covariance on the dynamics of low-density populations, 2) use spatial genetic lineages to understand how landscape features and human traffic patterns affect genetic structure and movement, and 3) integrate demographic and genetic information to determine how landscape features, human movement, and local population processes drive large-scale invasion patterns by simulating invasion on layered maps of population dynamic and movement parameters."

Understanding how and why populations are structured is a major goal of evolutionary biologists because the resulting population genetic structure affects rates of local adaptation, speciation and extinction. This study will examine the population genetic structure of lice that live on the feathers of pigeons. Natural populations are typically subdivided, or genetically structured, because geographic or ecological factors influence the chance that two individuals will mate. One major factor that influences population genetic structure is dispersal, the movement of individuals from one place to another. When individuals disperse to new populations, they mate with individuals in the new population reducing population genetic structure. We know little about how dispersal affects the magnitude of this structure. Host-parasite systems offer highly tractable systems with which to study how different modes of dispersal influence population genetic structure. This study will do so by examining population genetic structure of different parasite species that are located on the same host individuals. In addition, this study will produce an inquiry-based activity aimed at middle-school students, ""Hitchhikers guide to the city: Lessons from lice,"" and will contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>In this study, researchers will use a pigeon-louse, host-parasite system to investigate how population genetic structure differs between two species of parasitic feather lice (Order: Phthiraptera) that differ in their ability to disperse. The study will investigate the role of vertical dispersal and horizontal dispersal in structuring the populations of wing lice and body lice that occur on Rock Pigeons (Columba livia).  Although these lice are ecologically very similar, wing lice can disperse phoretically using flies, whereas body lice do not. Despite the pervasiveness of phoresy, the affect that this dispersal mechanism has on the population structure of these organisms is unknown. Researchers will use a nested sampling design to collect lice from different host individuals, in different flocks, in different regions of the world. They will sample in regions where flies are present, and where flies are not present and phoresis cannot occur. They will use microsatellite data to determine the relative role of vertical and horizontal-phoretic dispersal in structuring louse populations."

Samples are fabricated by employing an advanced dual-chamber co-deposition system, developed at the University of Minnesota, that enables growth of various composite materials of a nanocrystal Si or Ge embedded in a thin-film matrix of hydrogenated amorphous silicon or germanium, or an insulating silicon nitride. The material properties are evaluated by using structural (transmission electron microscopy, Fourier transform infra-red spectroscopy, and Raman spectroscopy), optical (transmission and constant photocurrent techniques) and electrical characterization techniques. The charge transport in nanostructured films is investigated by using 1/f noise spectroscopy that is highly sensitive to filamentary conduction processes, as well as thermopower and Hall-effect measurements, in order to explore the mechanisms underlying the recently reported anomalous hopping conductivity."

The ultimate goal is to gain insights leading to optimization of these designer nanocomposites for applications as wavelength shifters pertaining to up- and down-converters in solar cells and light emitting diodes. Pulsed laser deposition is used to synthesize layered nanocomposite materials so that very fine control of the distribution of the optically-active dopant and the nanocrystalline structure responsible for the optical behavior is achieved, leading to the development of a glass ceramic with enhanced light output. Systematic studies of optical behavior, as a function of parameters such as the designed distribution of the optically-active component layers within the glass matrix and the relative concentrations of optical dopants and nanocrystals, enable an understanding of how energy transfer between the luminescent dopant atoms and the nanocrystals (and thus the optical efficiency) can be controlled. The combination of in situ¬ transmission electron microscopy, ellipsometry and X-ray diffraction enables the structure-property relationships to be visualized and linked together. For example, critical control over optimum dopant position can be achieved by studying the diffusion paths of the dopants during in situ heating."

Despite its significance as a treasure trove of biodiversity, Vanuatu's plants and fungi remain poorly documented, leaving a significant gap in our knowledge of regional biodiversity compared with neighboring island countries, all of which have active or completed flora surveys. The few existing plant surveys in Vanuatu have focused primarily on the northern end of the archipelago. In the southern part of the country, little reliable botanical data exist, and there is great potential for new scientific discoveries.  This project focuses on Tafea Province, the five southernmost islands of Vanuatu. In March, 2015, Tafea Province was the site of a catastrophic category-5 super-cyclone.  Just prior to that, eight forest transects were established to characterize vegetation growth and change over time. These study sites were severely impacted by the storm, and monitoring efforts will provide an important opportunity to understand how Pacific-Island forests recover from this type of event. Along with its rich biological diversity, Vanuatu is also the most linguistically rich country in the world, with 112 languages for a total population of only 253,000; nine of these languages are found only in Tafea Province. As globalization and economic development are proceeding in Vanuatu, local languages are being replaced by English, French, and Bislama (a local Creole), and thus there is a critical need to document local languages and the botanical knowledge that is encapsulated therein. Undergraduate students will be trained in the analysis of linguistic data, and graduate students will participate in all aspects of the research and receive valuable training in tropical botany and mycology.<br/><br/>The researchers will complete the first comprehensive survey of angiosperms, gymnosperms, ferns, lycophytes, bryophytes, endophytic and macro-fungi, and lichens ever undertaken in Tafea Province. Surveys will be conducted using two approaches: 1) establishment of permanent monitoring transects and plots, which will allow for both vegetation analysis and dense floristic and fungal sampling, and provide an opportunity for long-term monitoring in the face of global climate change, and 2) a general collecting approach will be used across larger areas. From these data, an annotated checklist (both hard copy and online) will be assembled using the database of newly collected and historical specimens. The checklist will allow for tests of phytogeographic relationships among Vanuatu and its closest neighbors (New Caledonia and Fiji), allowing the researchers to address questions relating to levels of endemism, species distributions, and evolution of the regional flora. Because most land in Vanuatu is held under customary ownership, and local people are the stewards of their environments, the loss of biocultural knowledge is a serious threat to their ability to manage biodiversity resources sustainably. To support local environmental education efforts, the project will combine the expertise of the team's linguists and botanists to work with indigenous speakers of eight Tafean languages to document names of plants and fungi, providing a tangible linkage between biodiversity, traditional culture, and conservation. Project linguists will produce printed and digital dictionaries of indigenous plant and fungal names and will use web-based videography and 'story maps', which spatially link names and traditional uses of organisms onto the landscape, helping viewers visualize the connections between biodiversity, knowledge, and place, providing a complement to the botanical databases."

Researchers can make a detailed exploration of scientific design alternatives under a wide set of operating environments using runs from a simulator of a physical system, possibly coupled with those from a traditional physical system experiment. This research project will advance the statistical modeling, design, and analysis of experiments that use computer simulators. The first research area is Improved Modeling of Simulator Output: The investigators will develop flexible stochastic models that will allow more accurate prediction in settings where the simulator provides related multivariate output of the performance of a physical system. Current prediction models either assume output independence (knowledge of one output gives no information about other outputs) or a linear dependence on a common set of latent drivers. The second research area concerns Advances in Emulation: The investigators aim to devise efficient emulators of simulator output for novel input and output settings such as when gradient information is available or when the output consists of both point and integrated measures. They plan to construct predictors that incorporate natural invariances present in the simulator output. For example, the predicted response should be constant under permutations of the inputs when the output satisfies this condition; the project will quantify the uncertainty in the invariant predictors. The investigators also plan to quantify the uncertainty of a recent, theoretically-justified method of calibrating computer simulators based on physical experimental data. The third research area is the Design of Simulator Experiments: Efficient designs of simulator experiments will be devised to minimize the computational effort required to determine the sensitivity of a simulator output to each of its inputs. <br/><br/>This research will build a statistical framework for the modeling, design and analysis of experiments that employ computer simulators. The specific goals are (1) to devise flexible interpolating stochastic models for computer simulators with multivariate output; (2) to invent efficient predictors for novel input and output settings such as when gradient information is available or when the output consists of both point and integrated responses; (3) to develop emulators of simulator output that incorporate the same invariances present in the simulator responses; (4) to quantify the uncertainty of L2 calibrated predictors for expensive computer codes; and (5) to construct new sliced Latin hypercube designs to allow the efficient calculation of global sensitivity indices. The investigators will develop new modes for training statistics graduate students having interests in engineering applications. Opportunities will be created for subject matter specialists to provide critical practical challenges in three areas: aerospace/mechanical engineering, biomechanics, and material science, and to conduct joint applied projects with the researchers."

Their dimensions and shapes are determined by the backbone and side-chain lengths and the interactions of side chains with themselves and their environment. These giant molecules exhibit intriguing properties and are found in the human body performing a wide variety of functions, including joint lubrication, lung clearance, and cell signaling. This project will design,  synthesize, develop, and study in detail molecular brushes that can change their sizes and shapes in water in response to environmental variations and stimuli.  They will be designed to emulate the behavior of a natural protein in our bodies called the ""von Willebrand factor"", which causes our blood to clot at the site of an injury, thus stopping the bleeding.  The synthetic strategies, properties, and fundamental understanding of such macromolecules will have potential impact to many technologies, including material surface modification, lubrication, medication delivery, etc., thus benefiting society. The research program will also have societal impact via human-resource development. It provides a platform to train next-generation scientists (postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students). Outreach activities will be organized in collaboration with local high school teachers, aimed at stimulating the interest of high school students toward STEM fields.<br/><br/>       <br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project is aimed at synthesizing and studying molecular brushes that can exhibit controllable changes in size and shape upon application of external stimuli. Its behavior is inspired by the von Willebrand factor, which enables blood clotting in response to an injury by unraveling from a non-sticky soluble globular shape to an extended nano-object exposing a large number of binding sites to form a clot at the site of an injury.  Specifically, the research program will develop general strategies to prepare responsive molecular brushes using state-of-the-art polymer synthesis techniques, investigate stimuli-triggered changes in molecular dimension, conformation, and shape in aqueous solution, and elucidate the effects of various molecular parameters on stimuli-responsive properties. A series of molecular brushes with various molecular architectures, chemical compositions, grafting densities, and molecular weights will be prepared, and their stimuli-responsive behavior in water will be characterized by a broad range of techniques, including dynamic light scattering (DLS), atomic force microscopy (AFM), and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). DLS can conveniently provide in-situ information on molecular dimensions under different conditions; AFM and TEM allow for directly visualizing the brush molecules. The  control of interactions of these giant molecules with other macromolecules and solid materials will be demonstrated via external stimuli.  The knowledge gained from this study will be used to guide the design and synthesis of functional molecular brushes."

Projected changes in air temperature and precipitation in the coming century are expected to further impact water resources and the biodiversity dependent on these systems, yet basic data describing variation in streamflow and water temperature across North America are not available. This project will address this issue by generating the ""HydroClim"" dataset, which will provide monthly streamflow and water temperature predictions for stream sections in all major watersheds across the United States and Canada from 1950-2099. This work will produce the first dataset on freshwater resources in North America of this scope and resolution. These data will provide a vast array of benefits to the public in terms of greater understanding of water resources in the coming century as well as numerous training opportunities directed at developing a large and interactive group of scientists focusing on the conservation of water resources and freshwater biodiversity in the United States and Canada. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this project is to develop and distribute ""HydroClim"", a data set characterizing contemporary and future streamflows and water temperatures in individual stream sections in all major watersheds across the United States and Canada.

The SWAT hydrologic and water temperature models will be generated using contemporary air temperature and precipitation data as well as future climate data from multiple Global Climate Model scenarios to produce monthly estimates of streamflow volume and water temperature for the years 1950-2099. These data will also be integrated with FishNet 2 (www.fishnet2.net), an established data portal that provides scientists, government agencies, resource managers, and the general public free and open access to occurrences of over 4.1 million species lots of freshwater fishes, globally, and over 2 million lots for the United States and Canada, thus allowing for the characterization of the habitat requirements of freshwater species in this region. Results from these efforts will also allow for examination of the sensitivity of streams throughout the United States and Canada to changes in climate, thus providing a greater understanding of the factors regulating water resources as well as the distribution of freshwater biodiversity both now and in the coming century.

Studying living microbialites (carbonate rocks built by microbes, ancient counterparts of coral reefs) in Fayetteville Green Lake, NY, will help solve this riddle. This interdisciplinary study will reveal how the internal structure of these living rocks is formed by microbes and how it is altered by the action of microscopic unicellular predators (so-called protists). Understanding the role of protists in living examples will help to decipher microbialites in the rock record, ultimately improving understanding of the evolution of life on early Earth. The petroleum industry seeks to improve understanding of microbialites' microstructure. The discovery of large subsalt reservoirs off the coast of Brazil, Congo, Eritrea and in the US Gulf of Mexico challenged oil companies to understand the record of very deep (~1-2 km thick) fossil microbialites present underneath an equally thick salt layer. This project will increase the understanding of fabric porosity, and reservoir rocks, critical factors in decision-making during oil exploration. The major outreach activity will be a Science through Art traveling exhibition related to microbialite ecosystems and predation on early Earth, with a tentative title of ""Decimation of Slime World"" (in other words, predation of microbialites). This theme will generate wide interest, and will offer explanations about the research findings in ways that would otherwise escape the art-loving public sector.<br/><br/>The oldest fossil microbialites are the most visible manifestations of microbial life on early Earth. Comprehension of structural differences between microbialite types (e.g., clotted thrombolites, laminated stromatolites) is hampered by incomplete knowledge of their microbiology and early diagenesis. Prokaryotic diversity in extant marine microbialites is well established, however, until recently heterotrophic protists inhabiting these structures and their impact on mesofabric were unknown. A comparative study of non-marine microbialites is lacking. Fayetteville Green Lake NY (FGL), a Proterozoic ocean analog, supports extant microbialites in a non-marine setting. Investigations will assess the role of eukaryotes, notably protists, in microbialite fabric modification and in the possible transition from laminated to clotted mesofabrics during early diagenesis. Four hypotheses will be addressed using FGL materials with these specific aims: 1. Assess biodiversity and activities in microbialites and non-microbialite habitats via sequencing, Fluorescently Labeled Embedded Core method, and various microscopy methods. 2. Determine biogeochemistry using microelectrodes and major in situ microbial activities to link microbiota, element distribution, and mesofabric. 3. Obtain microbialite mesofabric information using microCT scanning. 4. Combine SEM-EDS and Synchrotron-based microXRF to analyze mesofabric features, especially clots, for presence of pyrite and biogenic metals. 5. Determine impact of foraminifera on microbialite mesofabric using seeding experiment. 6. Perform ?forced diagenesis? by incubating microbialite samples under elevated pressure/temperature, inspecting changes in mesofabric using SEM, µCT and µXRF scanning. 7. Use SEM and petrographic thin sections to examine relict thrombolite mesofabric for former eukaryote activity/presence."

These topics lie at the interface of descriptive set theory, measured group theory, graph theory, ergodic theory, probability theory, and operator algebras. In recent years, mathematicians in these fields have come to realize that problems concerning algebraic, dynamical, and descriptive structural complexity of countable group and equivalence relations can be fruitfully studied via descriptive combinatorial and graph theoretic means. The principal investigator and collaborators have employed this combinatorial perspective to create new tools used to answer several open problems in these fields. In addition to a combinatorial perspective, research in these fields is also facilitated by a global perspective, from which problems in ergodic theory, for example, may be seen as topological-dynamical and descriptive problems concerning actions of the group of automorphisms of a standard probability space. This research project aims to generate more new general tools and to promote fruitful interactions among these fields. <br/><br/>Measured group theory seeks to understand countably infinite groups through ergodic theoretic properties of their measurable actions on standard probability spaces, and particularly through structural properties of the orbit equivalence relations generated by these actions. The motivating phenomenon is that algebraic properties of an acting group are often expressed through measurable properties of the associated equivalence relation. An extreme form of this phenomenon is seen in orbit equivalence and cocycle rigidity and superrigidity theorems, which state that in certain settings an equivalence relation completely remembers the group from which it was generated. At the other extreme are what might be called orbit equivalence anti-rigidity theorems, stating that certain groups and actions cannot be distinguished by looking at the equivalence relations they generate. This research project touches upon phenomena at both of these extremes. The questions are motivated by rigidity/anti-rigidity results established by the principal investigator and collaborators, which have led to new questions addressed in this project. The project will address problems concerning algebraic, dynamical, and descriptive structural complexity of countable groups and equivalence relations, specifically in the areas of orbit equivalence, treeability, cocycle superrigidity, weak equivalence rigidity, and measurable combinatorial properties and parameters of graphs and group actions. The project pursues a descriptive combinatorial and graph theoretic approach to these problems."

Due to its high biodiversity and a good understanding of its mode of parasitism, the non-photosynthetic parasitic plant genus Orobanche provides a remarkable opportunity for understanding the unique macro- and microevolutionary consequences of parasitism in a phylogenetic framework. Recent work has identified both evolutionary and genetic consequences, including numerous host specific lineages as well as host-to-parasite horizontal gene transfer. This research will use genomic-scale sequencing of new-world Orobanche and field studies across North America to develop the following: (1) a fine-scale understanding of tempo and mode of genome evolution in parasitic plants, (2) a better understanding of host-breadth, and (3) abiotic and biotic habitat characteristics, with a taxonomic revision to follow. In addition to advancing the fields of evolutionary biology and ecology, an improved understanding of host specificity and parasite genomics may be of use in combating several species of Orobanche that cause severe agricultural damage to tomato, sunflower, and other crops in Europe, Asia, and the Americas. One graduate and several undergraduate students will receive training in laboratory and museum research techniques, and will have the opportunity to present the results at regional and national meetings.<br/><br/>Specifically, we will use a genome skimming approach, coupled with field studies across North America to study (1) fine-scale tempo and mode of plastid and mitochondrial evolution in new-world Orobanche, (2) host-breadth of numerous lineages, (3) abiotic and biotic habitat characteristics to better understand distributions, and (4) diagnosable features of lineages, leading directly to taxonomic revision.

The project aims to develop new statistical machine learning methods to determine whether evolutionary changes are manifested through changes in how metabolites interact with each other in metabolic pathways. More broadly, the methodologies under development in this project and the accompanying software will provide novel tools for biomedical researchers to infer differential patterns of connectivity in molecular networks associated with complex diseases. <br/><br/>The methodologies under development in this project utilize the framework of graphical models to estimate interactions among components of biological networks and identify changes in such networks associated with evolution and aging. Probabilistic graphical models provide a general framework for modeling interactions among random variables. While recent methodological and theoretical advances have facilitated the applications of graphical models to analysis of high-dimensional biological networks, existing methods are not applicable to heterogeneous and non-Gaussian observations obtained from mass-spectrometry-based metabolomics profiling experiments in complex aging studies. The research project aims to bridge this gap by developing new statistical machine learning methods for learning graphical models from heterogeneous and non-Gaussian observations and inferring changes in graphical models in different subpopulations. In particular, the project will (i) develop a flexible framework for estimation of multiple graphical models from heterogeneous populations with complex structures, (ii) develop an inference framework for detecting differential connectivity in biological networks, and (iii) provide a general framework for estimation of non-Gaussian graphical models, with changes over time or experimental conditions. Together, these tools provide a comprehensive framework for differential network analysis and will advance the current state of statistical machine learning methods for the analysis of high-dimensional biological networks."

The proposed methods are expected to bring a great impact to accelerate the discovery of new personalized treatment strategies. Therefore the proposed work is directly related with the White House Precision Medicine Initiative(https://www.whitehouse.gov/precision-medicine) as a research effort to revolutionize how to improve health and treat disease. The proposed methods are also general enough to be applied to a variety of data sources including clinical, biomarker, economic and financial data. If successful, the projects will greatly enhance the acquisition and analysis of large-scale data for the scientific and engineering communities.<br/><br/>The main objective of this proposal is to develop cutting-edge semiparametric methods and machine learning tools to realize the promise of precision medicine. Specifically, the PI aims to: develop flexible and efficient methods for discovering optimal ITRs (Aim 1); develop a general class of optimal ITRs (Aim 2); develop optimal ITRs with high-dimensional data (Aim 3); and develop optimal ITRs under population heterogeneity (Aim 4). The proposed work contributes to both semiparametric inference and machine learning fields. Machine learning methods have rarely been studied for doubly robust estimation and optimal ITRs with high-dimensional data. The theoretical developments including driving nonasymptotic distribution, risk bounds, new empirical process technical tools are challenging. The methodologies to be developed in this project will be fundamentally important and generally applicable for studying semiparametric models in high-dimensional setting. Using semiparametric and machine learning methods for precision medicine is an emerging novel area. The integration of research and education is a key aspect of this project. New courses on statistical learning and semiparametric inference will be developed. These courses will broaden the areas of specialized training in a department that has a strong history of attracting under represented groups. The PI is expecting to stimulate interests from a diverse group of researchers in numerous fields. The PI will also reach out to the K-12 education levels by training high school teachers."

Double network (DN) hydrogels, consisting of two contrasting and interpenetrating polymer networks, are considered as perhaps the toughest soft materials. Current knowledge of DN gels stemming from synthesis methods to toughening mechanisms comes mainly from chemically crosslinked DN gels, but these lack in self-recovery and self-healing properties. Differently from chemically crosslinked DN gels, the proposed work attempts to develop a new class of physically-based DN hydrogels with integrated superior mechanical, self-healing, self-recovery, and mechanically-induced optical properties.  Systematic exploration of both chemically- and physically-linked DN gels will enable a better fundamental understanding of structure-property relationships and a better design of next-generation tough hydrogels with other desirable properties. New knowledge and techniques derived from this project may also lead to engineering applications such as robust artificial tissues, self-healing materials, smart stress-responsive robots, and damage-control sensors. The project will provide research opportunities to students at all levels, including underrepresented students, and help develop textbook knowledge and hands-on skills in polymer physics, materials chemistry, molecular simulations, and engineering design. The project will also integrate broader educational aspects via curriculum development, summer internships, and local outreach activities.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The main objective of this project is to develop new physically-linked double-network (DN) hydrogels with three integrated properties of highly mechanical strength, self-healing properties, and mechanical-induced luminescence. By studying three types of physically-linked DN gels with and without different crosslinkers, the PI's group expects to reveal some fundamental principles about the intrinsic structure-property relationships amongst structural network topologies, functional interactions between and within two networks, and structural dependence on toughening, self-healing, and energy-dissipation mechanisms. To this end three tasks will be explored: The first task is to study the functional role of the first and second networks on mechanical properties of the physically-based DN gels and to understand how different networks and their interactions affect observable mechanical properties. The second task centers on the study of the self-recovery and self-healing properties and mechanisms of the DN gels while still retaining good mechanical properties. In parallel to the experimental tasks, computational components will include the study of structure, dynamics, and interactions between the two networks and crosslinkers.  Moreover, a theoretical model will be developed to describe the dependence of networks on mechanical, self-recovery/healing properties, and energy dissipation. Combination and comparison of the computational and experimental results will help to establish a relationship between the macroscopic performance of the physically-linked DN gels and the nanoscopic network interactions at different time-scales and length-scales, eventually aiming to develop a set of rules for rational design of new tough gels."

Despite its significance as a treasure trove of biodiversity, Vanuatu's plants and fungi remain poorly documented, leaving a significant gap in our knowledge of regional biodiversity compared with neighboring island countries, all of which have active or completed flora surveys. The few existing plant surveys in Vanuatu have focused primarily on the northern end of the archipelago. In the southern part of the country, little reliable botanical data exist, and there is great potential for new scientific discoveries.  This project focuses on Tafea Province, the five southernmost islands of Vanuatu. In March, 2015, Tafea Province was the site of a catastrophic category-5 super-cyclone.  Just prior to that, eight forest transects were established to characterize vegetation growth and change over time. These study sites were severely impacted by the storm, and monitoring efforts will provide an important opportunity to understand how Pacific-Island forests recover from this type of event. Along with its rich biological diversity, Vanuatu is also the most linguistically rich country in the world, with 112 languages for a total population of only 253,000; nine of these languages are found only in Tafea Province. As globalization and economic development are proceeding in Vanuatu, local languages are being replaced by English, French, and Bislama (a local Creole), and thus there is a critical need to document local languages and the botanical knowledge that is encapsulated therein. Undergraduate students will be trained in the analysis of linguistic data, and graduate students will participate in all aspects of the research and receive valuable training in tropical botany and mycology.<br/><br/>The researchers will complete the first comprehensive survey of angiosperms, gymnosperms, ferns, lycophytes, bryophytes, endophytic and macro-fungi, and lichens ever undertaken in Tafea Province. Surveys will be conducted using two approaches: 1) establishment of permanent monitoring transects and plots, which will allow for both vegetation analysis and dense floristic and fungal sampling, and provide an opportunity for long-term monitoring in the face of global climate change, and 2) a general collecting approach will be used across larger areas. From these data, an annotated checklist (both hard copy and online) will be assembled using the database of newly collected and historical specimens. The checklist will allow for tests of phytogeographic relationships among Vanuatu and its closest neighbors (New Caledonia and Fiji), allowing the researchers to address questions relating to levels of endemism, species distributions, and evolution of the regional flora. Because most land in Vanuatu is held under customary ownership, and local people are the stewards of their environments, the loss of biocultural knowledge is a serious threat to their ability to manage biodiversity resources sustainably. To support local environmental education efforts, the project will combine the expertise of the team's linguists and botanists to work with indigenous speakers of eight Tafean languages to document names of plants and fungi, providing a tangible linkage between biodiversity, traditional culture, and conservation. Project linguists will produce printed and digital dictionaries of indigenous plant and fungal names and will use web-based videography and 'story maps', which spatially link names and traditional uses of organisms onto the landscape, helping viewers visualize the connections between biodiversity, knowledge, and place, providing a complement to the botanical databases."

Time series algorithms have proven to be a powerful computational strategy for understanding transcriptional regulation from gene expression data by using the ordering of events to help identify regulatory interactions. However, there are limits to the quality and types of interactions that can be inferred from bulk gene expression data, which are averaged over many different cells and do not reflect protein post-translational modifications. Single-cell RNA-seq measures gene expression in individual cells, capturing diverse cellular states and fine-grained progression through biological processes. Mass spectrometry-based phosphoproteomics data reveal the rapid and widespread changes in protein phosphorylation that occur over time during cellular signaling responses. These two types of data have great potential for discovering condition-specific transcriptional regulatory and signaling mechanisms. This project will design novel time series algorithms to improve the prediction of transcriptional and signaling network interactions. These methods will be developed as open source software so that the computational approaches can be adopted in a wide variety of biological systems. Time series data analysis will also be incorporated into local public outreach programs and new training workshops designed to teach computational thinking to biology students.<br/><br/>Biological processes are dynamic, and single-cell gene expression data can provide noisy snapshots of temporal behaviors. Existing computational techniques can estimate each cell's progression through a temporal process from single-cell data, producing cell-specific pseudo-times. These pseudo-time series data are imprecise and irregularly-spaced but contain far more time points than a traditional time series experiment. This project will use causality analysis techniques that require a large number of time points to infer causal gene-gene regulatory relationships. Kernel methods will adapt the causality algorithms to accommodate the heterogeneity of single-cell data and combinatorial nature of transcriptional regulation. To study cellular signaling, computational analysis of time series phosphorylation changes will determine not only which proteins are active in a signaling response but also the temporal intervals in which they are involved. The project will assess both non-stationary Gaussian processes and hidden Markov models for modeling temporal changes in protein phosphorylation. A novel signaling pathway reconstruction algorithm will then flexibly integrate many types of data-derived constraints (for example, early responders cannot be activated by late responders, protein-protein interaction network connectivity relationships, etc.) using statistical relational learning techniques for probabilistic reasoning.

Driving innovation in technologies such as clean energy generation and storage and numerous biomedical technologies requires new materials that can serve in different capacities simultaneously. One promising class of materials consists of very large molecules (polymers) able to transport ions and electrons while retaining their mechanical integrity, often under extreme conditions of high temperatures, solvents, and external stresses that may affect their performance.  The ability of these materials to play multiple roles is attained by tailoring molecular segments with different chemical functionalities into one large molecule, including blocks for transporting ions and electrons and blocks to provide mechanical stability.  Controlling the way these segments organize and perform electrically as they are integrated into devices is key to the design of new effective platforms.  In this project, using large-scale computational studies coupled with state-of-the-art neutron measurements, the effects of the structure of these polymers will be correlated with their dynamics as they are exposed to high temperatures and solvents.  The projected results will provide the understanding that will enhance the ability to design well-controlled multi-functional polymers, tailored with desired properties for specific applications.  The project is closely integrated with interdisciplinary education and training of graduate and undergraduate students and high-school outreach.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Polymers that consist of ionizable blocks (ionomers, or polyelectrolytes) tethered to additional segments with well defined functionalities, constitute promising media for a large number of applications from clean energy and storage to sensors and drug delivery vehicles. The role of the ionic groups is two-fold: they form physical crosslinks while facilitating transport of ions and polar guest molecules.  As these two functions often require dynamics of opposing nature, the additional blocks affect the overall stability of such polymers.  Here, using large-scale molecular dynamics simulations coupled with neutron scattering techniques, the correlation of polymer dynamics with ionic associations and their cohesiveness will be investigated on a series of model copolymers that consist of styrene sulfonate as the ionic block tethered to different non-ionic segments. Numerous studies have probed the structure of ion-containing polymers and polyelectrolytes, revealing a rich variety of morphologies and establishing a clear correlation between structure and transport. One key challenge that arises from these studies is the need to unfold the correlation between ionic associations and their impact on the mobility of the polymers.  The relationship of the dynamics with the number, topology, and stability of the ionic associations impacts the polymer properties and in turn affects a large number of technologies. This research is set to resolve the effects of constraints formed by ionic associations on polymer dynamics. Advances in computational techniques coupled with new developments in neutron scattering will enable a new insight into the dynamics of polymers under the confinement of physical crosslinks."

This has led to a wide range of very useful materials (such as fibers, plastics and adhesives) that are ubiquitous in our daily lives. One issue with such materials is that when they break or degrade it can be difficult and/or not cost effective to repair or recycle them. What if plastics could be accessed that would allow them to either heal scratches or deformations or to be more efficiently recycled. One way to achieve this is to design into the polymer structure reversible bonds that can be broken and remade upon application of a relatively small amount of heat or light. With this NSF funding the Rowan group is working on a range of different stimuli-responsive reversible bonds that will be incorporated into polymers and used to access new classes of responsive/adaptive materials. A key component of these systems is the ability to systematically control the stimulus required to access the reversible character of the bond which in turn allows them to be tailored for different applications. With these materials the Rowan group will focus on the development of (1) new soft actuators that act like 'polymeric muscles' and offer applications to (soft) robotics, (2) materials that exhibit both scratch-healing characteristics as well as enhanced toughness to extend their useful operational lifetime, and (3) on-demand reversible glues and adhesives. This project involves graduate and undergraduate students, students from local high schools, including students from underserved and predominately minority neighborhoods of Chicago. The integrated approach of this project provides students at all levels with an exciting learning environment and broad research experiences. In addition, Prof. Rowan and his research group will design new hands-on demonstrations for a Museum outreach program entitled ""Nature's Materials"", which is part of the Cleveland Museum of Natural History's ""Winter Discovery Day"" on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day.  This program aims (i) to expose the local community to polymers and how Nature's materials can help us create a sustainable planet, and (ii) to train current graduate students on how to communicate to and educate the general public and younger students about science and technology.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The introduction of dynamic bonds (that can undergo reversible exchange) into a polymer network imparts new adaptive properties onto the materials. The adaptive properties come from the network's ability to alter its architecture (and/or composition) through dynamic bond exchange and as such have been termed structurally-dynamic polymers. Depending on the specific type, placement and amount of the dynamic bond incorporated into the network the resulting films will have the ability to be re-processable/re-moldable, exhibit healing and/or shape-memory properties, and even open the door to materials that have enhanced toughness, stress relaxation, and/or adaptive adhesion capabilities. This proposal outlines the synthetic as well as structural (via NMR, MALDI-MS, FT-IR, UV, POM and WAXS/SAXS) and mechanical (rheology, tensile testing, and dynamic mechanical thermal analysis) studies on three different classes of structurally-dynamic polymers, focusing not only on investigating the basic science of these systems but also on targeting specific applications that suit the specific dynamic behavior of the film's chemistry. Specifically, the Rowan group will focus on the synthesis, characterization, and investigation of (1) poly(disulfides), (2) thia-Michael adduct-containing polymers and (3) poly(alkylureas). While poly(disulfides) networks are known and have been investigated as healable materials, their use to access photo-adaptive liquid crystalline elastomers is new.  Specific interest is in accessing 3D actuating films with this class of material. The thia-Michael reaction can be dynamic at room temperature, but to date, this class of dynamic bond has received little attention in the polymer field. The advantage of this bond is that both its exchange thermodynamics and kinetics can be systematically altered by changing the electronics of the alkene (Michael acceptor). The final class of dynamic bond the PI will investigate is the most commercially relevant and is based on bulky alkylureas. Alkylureas are used as blocked (protected) isocyanates in the polyurethane industry that deblock at temperatures >100°C. The PI will target/develop alkylureas and derivatives that can deblock at lower temperatures. The goal for these last two classes of materials is to develop structure/property relationships focusing on their solid state mechanical and adaptive properties."

To correctly turn on and off the needed sets of genes requires coordinated action by several hundred regulatory molecules.  The regulators interact with the genome and with each other: understanding how this happens is one of the most important questions biological researchers are trying to answer. This project will use chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-Seq) data, which measures where a particular regulator is located on the genome: this may be zero, one or a few hundred positions out of the billions possible in a genome. Regulators often act together and one may change the action of another, so another part of the proposed work is to discover sites where regulators are co-localized. However, co-localization alone does not show whether regulators interact directly, or indirectly through an intermediate. The overall goal of this project is to develop a computational framework that identifies direct and indirect interactions among regulators, using thousands of ChIP-seq datasets. This framework will develop novel statistical and machine learning techniques to overcome the limitations of existing methods. The techniques that are developed will be applied to answer the following fundamental questions: How do hundreds of regulators interact with each other to regulate the genome? How do these regulator interactions differ across cell types? How do these interactions differ across different species (human, mouse, fly and worm)? The implementation of the new methods will be made publicly available to help many other scientists to study how the human genome works. This project is interdisciplinary in nature and has significant emphasis on interdisciplinary education, through project courses and outreach activities.<br/><br/><br/>Identifying the interactions among chromatin regulators, such as transcription factors and histone modifications, is of paramount importance to understand genome regulation. To infer this network of interactions, this research will compare multiple chromatin immunoprecipitation-sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets, each measuring genome-wide localization of a chromatin regulator. Co-localization may indicate that two regulators interact directly or indirectly through transitive interactions. To identify direct interactions, the proposal aims to develop novel network inference methods to infer conditional dependence relationships (i.e., correlation not explained via any other variables in the network) among a large number of ChIP-seq datasets. While network inference has become a commonly used analysis tool for other types of data, such as gene expression data, the immense size of the ChIP-seq data sets and the strong redundancies present in the data limit the use of existing network inference methods. To resolve these challenges, this research proposes a novel machine learning (ML) framework to enable network inference from large collections of ChIP-seq data: 1) efficient ML methods to infer the chromatin network based on the entire ENCODE ChIP-seq data that contain redundancies; 2) new ML methods to jointly infer the context-specific chromatin networks and the associated genomic contexts by incorporating other types of genomic data; and 3) new ML methods to learn a conserved chromatin network across species and predict chromatin factor interactions even if the factors are not measured in the species of study.

Professor Read de Alaniz is a faculty member in the Department of Chemistry at University of California Santa Barbara (UCSB).  He is developing new strategies for the direct incorporation of nitrogen and oxygen atoms into structurally diverse molecules using earth abundant metals. The goal of this research is to develop a general and versatile strategy to expedite the discovery of therapeutic agents. The molecular diversity of nitrogen containing therapeutic agents and the strong influence nitrogen substituents have on both pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics mandates the development of new methodologies for installing these functional groups into small therapeutic organic molecules. In addition, the methodology has potential applications in material science, as well as for the construct of agrochemical compounds. The project is well suited for the education of scientists at all levels.  The educational plan includes training of underrepresented groups in outstanding professional development and research training programs at UCSB's California NanoSystems Institute and Materials Research Lab (notably the RISE, SIMS, UC LEADS, CAMP, and MARC programs), as well as developing a new multi-layered mentoring program for graduate students. <br/><br/>While the value of amines and the synthetic utility of radical reactions are well-established, exploration of the strategy for constructing carbon (C) - nitrogen (N) and C-oxygen (O) bonds by merging radical reactions with nitroso compounds is almost completely unknown. Through these studies, new opportunities in C-N bond-forming reactions that are mild, functional group tolerant, and use earth abundant copper are under development. These new transformations reduce the number of synthetic steps required to access nitrogen containing molecules that are otherwise difficult to prepare.  The transformations also give chemists access to new synthetic bond disconnections. Specifically, the goals of the proposed work are: 1) extend the scope of the recently developed copper-catalyzed radical addition with nitroso compounds to include heterocycles, benzyl bromides and alpha-bromo nitriles; 2) develop the reaction with commercially available aryl and heteroaryltrifluoroborates using nitrite salts to generate the nitroso reagent in situ; 3) apply this strategy to the concise total synthesis of pyrroloindoline alkaloid natural products; 4) develop a new intramolecular radical based N-O transfer process that provides spatial control of the nitrogen and oxygen heteroatoms over a range of architectures. Professor Read de Alaniz's group is well positioned to provide the highest level of education and training for students underrepresented in science. Outreach activities involving a new multi-layered mentoring program are part of the project."

This research will observe and interview physicians, nurses, and other caregivers about their work and the treatment decisions that they make around inpatient surgical procedures. This information will be used to systematically examine how collaborative networks evolve and change in hospitals. This research will inform efforts to improve the quality and reduce the costs of surgical care while providing new insights into important social science questions about how these kinds of networks form and grow.<br/><br/>In the last two decades social scientific research on networks has undergone a dramatic transformation as new data and methods have enabled a shift toward dynamic analysis. At the same time, work in the fields of organizational theory, economic, and cultural sociology has emphasized the contingent and situational nature of relationships, structures, and their effects. While networks of various sorts have been shown to influence individual and collective outcomes in a wide range of substantive areas, the linkages between micro network dynamics, macro network structures, and their effects have yet to be fully specified. This research will take important steps toward explaining the formation and effects of a substantively important class of networks by examining the ways in which organizational arrangements, individual choices, and existing relationships shape physicians' treatment decisions and ultimately the health of larger patient populations in individual hospitals and broader healthcare markets. This mechanism-based approach to understanding how physician relationships form, reproduce, and change in particular organizations and treatment situations integrates work on the collective dynamics of large-scale networks with theories that emphasize the organizational and institutional contexts in which relationships emerge, gain meaning, and exert their effects.  The theoretically anchored, observational, and interview-based field work that we propose herein seeks to clarify the complicated processes by which networks evolve while identifying specific mechanisms, scope conditions, and contingencies that span individual preferences, structural pressures, and organizational constraints or opportunities."

Professor Seidel is a member of the Department of Chemistry and Chemical Biology at Rutgers, the State University of New Jersey.  This project aims to advance the field of asymmetric catalysis on a fundamental level through exploration of conceptually new and underdeveloped methods of substrate activation. Asymmetric catalysis is the development of small molecules that can achieve high selectivity in chemical reactions - producing a specific product in high prurity. Chiral molecules have a right-handed and left-handed version.  These two mirror image molecules are described as enantiomers. A major goal of this resesarch is the development of reactions that produce enantiomerically enriched products through intervention of chiral ion pairs.  Novel Brønsted acids and hydrogen bond donor catalysts are used to facilitate unprecedented enantioselective processes and address challenging problems. Multifunctional catalysts are being used as a means to achieve enzyme-like catalysis under mild reaction conditions.  The research provides an excellent training ground for undergraduate and graduate students and preparing them for future careers in industry or academia. There is a strong commitment to engage a diverse group of students carrying out this research. <br/><br/>The ability to prepare complex chiral molecules in the most cost-effective way possible is directly dependent on the availability of sustainable synthetic methodologies.  The new synthetic methods that are emerging from this work provide enhanced access to biologically significant, chiral nitrogen containing compounds such as amines, amides, lactams, amino acids and indole containing substances that, in turn, help advance the chemical industry.  Furthermore, this project provides an ideal training ground to prepare the next generation of researchers in the chemical sciences. Students working on this project gain expertise in modern synthetic methods and laboratory techniques while being exposed to an intellectually stimulating and challenging environment that will prepare them for future careers."

Extensive research effort has been devoted to these topics, and novel numerical methods have been developed to efficiently deal with large-scale data sets and complex problems with uncertainty. Both UQ and big data analysis enable us to better understand the impacts of various uncertain inputs (boundary and initial data, parameter values, geometry, network etc.) to numerical predictions. UQ and big data analysis are thus critical to many important practical problems such as climate modeling, weather prediction, ocean dynamics, and smart grids. As the data size and dimensions of parameter space increase, one of the biggest challenges in UQ computations and big data analysis is the computational cost for analyzing the data and running the simulations. For large-scale complex interconnected systems, deterministic simulations can be very time-consuming, and conducting UQ simulations further increases the simulation cost and can be prohibitively expensive. This project aims to address these critical challenges. A novel set of highly efficient UQ and big data analysis algorithms will be developed to make big data analysis and UQ simulations amenable for large-scale complex interconnected systems. The new algorithms will significantly advance the current state of the art of UQ and big data analysis methods. The project also integrates educational opportunities, including exposing a range of undergraduate students to UQ and big data, giving graduate students the advanced skills needed to apply them, and mentoring Ph.D. students to be leaders in UQ and big data education and research. <br/><br/>The approach under development in this research project is based on scalable algorithms for multivariate Bayesian-treed Gaussian process and power network reduction; high-dimensional UQ algorithms; dynamic state estimation and model calibration for non-Gaussian noisy data; and advanced stochastic contingency analysis. The new algorithms will be based on building multi-fidelity models in both network models and probability space. Such algorithms can accommodate big data in linear time. In addition, while current contingency analysis allows only assessment of a static power grid status without considering uncertainty, the new approaches will allow analysis of contingency dynamically and probabilistically for cascade failures. The new algorithms will allow investigators to establish an efficient framework to rigorously quantify the uncertainty, analyze big data, and endow smart grid simulations with a composite error bar."

There is a voluminous literature using matching models to analyze two-sided markets, including problems of matching students to schools, residents to hospitals and workers to firms. The commonly employed solution concept when analyzing matching problems is the core. The use of the core as a solution concept incorporates the stability of a proposed matching between workers and firms: if the proposed outcome is not in the core, we would expect the outcome to be upset by the pair that could jointly improve their circumstances. Matching typically assumes complete information: all parties know exactly what the consequences would be for any possible match. The assumption is crucial because for the standard problems to which these models are applied, participating agents care about the characteristics of their matched party. The PIs propose to extend previous work that defines pairwise stability in incomplete information environments. The main thrust of the proposed work in this area is to investigate how the techniques used can be modified to understand matching in many-to-one environments. <br/><br/>The research will provide a better understanding the conditions that assure that there are stable matching of workers to firms and the efficiency properties of such matching. Such an understanding will give insight about possible interventions that will ameliorate inefficiencies in matching problems. The complete information matching theory has had a significant impact on the design of the mechanisms used to assign student to schools and residents to hospitals. This research has the potential of improving the economic performance of these mechanisms. <br/><br/>In the second part of the proposal the PIs propose to formally model the process by which laws are, or are not, followed by the agents assumed to be subject to those laws. They suggest that some laws continue to be followed for some time, despite changes in the environment that affect agents' incentives to follow those laws, but then collapse quickly even though there seems to be<br/>no dramatic change in the environment. The PIs propose to formalize models of this process of social change that are consistent with such behavior."

Despite its significance as a treasure trove of biodiversity, Vanuatu's plants and fungi remain poorly documented, leaving a significant gap in our knowledge of regional biodiversity compared with neighboring island countries, all of which have active or completed flora surveys. The few existing plant surveys in Vanuatu have focused primarily on the northern end of the archipelago. In the southern part of the country, little reliable botanical data exist, and there is great potential for new scientific discoveries.  This project focuses on Tafea Province, the five southernmost islands of Vanuatu. In March, 2015, Tafea Province was the site of a catastrophic category-5 super-cyclone.  Just prior to that, eight forest transects were established to characterize vegetation growth and change over time. These study sites were severely impacted by the storm, and monitoring efforts will provide an important opportunity to understand how Pacific-Island forests recover from this type of event. Along with its rich biological diversity, Vanuatu is also the most linguistically rich country in the world, with 112 languages for a total population of only 253,000; nine of these languages are found only in Tafea Province. As globalization and economic development are proceeding in Vanuatu, local languages are being replaced by English, French, and Bislama (a local Creole), and thus there is a critical need to document local languages and the botanical knowledge that is encapsulated therein. Undergraduate students will be trained in the analysis of linguistic data, and graduate students will participate in all aspects of the research and receive valuable training in tropical botany and mycology.<br/><br/>The researchers will complete the first comprehensive survey of angiosperms, gymnosperms, ferns, lycophytes, bryophytes, endophytic and macro-fungi, and lichens ever undertaken in Tafea Province. Surveys will be conducted using two approaches: 1) establishment of permanent monitoring transects and plots, which will allow for both vegetation analysis and dense floristic and fungal sampling, and provide an opportunity for long-term monitoring in the face of global climate change, and 2) a general collecting approach will be used across larger areas. From these data, an annotated checklist (both hard copy and online) will be assembled using the database of newly collected and historical specimens. The checklist will allow for tests of phytogeographic relationships among Vanuatu and its closest neighbors (New Caledonia and Fiji), allowing the researchers to address questions relating to levels of endemism, species distributions, and evolution of the regional flora. Because most land in Vanuatu is held under customary ownership, and local people are the stewards of their environments, the loss of biocultural knowledge is a serious threat to their ability to manage biodiversity resources sustainably. To support local environmental education efforts, the project will combine the expertise of the team's linguists and botanists to work with indigenous speakers of eight Tafean languages to document names of plants and fungi, providing a tangible linkage between biodiversity, traditional culture, and conservation. Project linguists will produce printed and digital dictionaries of indigenous plant and fungal names and will use web-based videography and 'story maps', which spatially link names and traditional uses of organisms onto the landscape, helping viewers visualize the connections between biodiversity, knowledge, and place, providing a complement to the botanical databases."

This project will continue a long-term study of the changing impacts of the zebra mussel on the Hudson River ecosystem, an ecologically and economically important invasive species that first appeared in the Hudson River in 1991.

(2) Can these changes be explained by relationships between the size and characteristics of the zebra mussel population and the Hudson River ecosystem? (3) How does zebra mussel grazing interact with climate to shape properties of the Hudson River ecosystem?

In addition they will analyze three interactions between zebra mussel invasion and climate: 1) effects of freshwater flow on zebra mussel grazing, 2) effects of water temperature and mussel grazing on phytoplankton biomass and 3) correlations between warm temperature and inter-annual variation in zebra mussel mortality. Five additional years of data will allow the researchers to document the remarkable changes that are now occurring in the Hudson River, and substantially increase the power of statistical models to describe these events."

In socially dominant male house mice, those with greater ability to gain and control territories containing females do so at the cost of less efficient locomotion. This trade-off is likely associated with specific anatomical and physiological traits. The results of this study will increase understanding of animal function and conflicting evolutionary pressures.

These data will be combined with previously collected data on competitive ability in semi-natural enclosures and locomotor economy using open-flow respirometry in a fully enclosed treadmill. Together, these data will allow the identification of which traits at what levels of biological organization underlie the locomotion-competition trade-off. Additionally, because traits that confer the greatest advantage during male-male contests are also typically those that are the most sexually dimorphic, the same hypotheses for differences between dominant and non-dominant males will be applied to male-female differences.

Insects make up much of the animal life that has evolved on Earth. Understanding why there are so many different kinds of insects and why they are so successful is fundamental to understanding how the wide diversity of life evolved. Insects are well known for producing many different chemical compounds that are required for their communication. Some chemicals help them to locate mates and food resources, others help them to organize activities within the nest or hive, and many others are used to warn off and defend against predators. This project focuses on this last aspect and is specifically testing the idea that the genes responsible for production of the hot chemical spray of the bombardier beetles are closely related to the genes responsible for producing similar chemicals in the insect's outer shell or exoskeleton. A main strength of the project is that it tackles this question by using multiple complementary approaches and by comparing eight different beetle species that are related to varying degrees. Half of these species have evolved a chemical defense system, the other half have not evolved this ability. Many college students and young scientists will receive scientific training in conjunction with the project.

This project will develop a detailed functional and evolutionary understanding of defensive chemistry evolution by focusing on species from the four lineages of quinone producing carabid beetles, including species commonly known as the bombardier beetles, which chemically blast their defensive quinones at extremely hot temperatures (up to 100 °C). Using a multidisciplinary approach, this project will identify genes involved in quinone production, elucidate chemical biosynthetic pathways, and describe the genetic architecture of quinone evolution. From gland-specific transcripts, candidate genes related to the production of defensive secretions will be identified and gene function will be validated experimentally by blocking gene transcription and looking at phenotypic changes in the compounds produced. The researchers will test the hypothesis that the genes up-regulated in secretory cells during quinone synthesis are closely related to those involved in quinone production in arthropod cuticle. Thus the project will empirically address the well-known, but untested, scenario of how the bombardier beetle evolved its explosive defense abilities. Ultimately, this project will explore how genetics and chemistry can interact over time and will reveal insights into the fundamental process of evolution."

In order to build trustworthy and secure OSNs, it has become critical to develop techniques to analyze and detect OSN fraud and attacks.  Existing OSN security approaches usually target a specific type of OSN fraud or attack and often fall short of detecting more complex attacks such as collusive attacks that involve many fraudulent OSN accounts, or dynamic attacks that encompass multiple attack phases over time.  This research, dubbed oSAFARI (Online SociAl network Fraud and Attack Research and Identification), models, analyzes and characterizes OSN frauds and attacks; designs, develops, and evaluates a new approach to detecting static OSN frauds and attacks; and further enhances the approach to handle dynamic attacks with multiple phases.  The research team plans to develop a new course focused on OSN attacks and defenses, which has the potential to be offered across many institutions.  To increase public security awareness, the team also plans to develop tutorial courses on typical OSN attacks and their defense and offer them at popular public events and in freshman classes.  The research team will broadly disseminate their results, tools, software, and documents to the research community, IT industries, and to OSN companies.<br/> <br/>This project embraces a systematic, comprehensive study of OSN frauds and attacks.  It models OSN threats by viewing an OSN as a graph embedded with attacker nodes and edges, identifies and analyzes specific forms of frauds and attacks, and evaluates state-of-the-art attack analysis and defense approaches.  It develops a spectral-analysis-based framework for OSN fraud and attack detection.  The framework transforms topological information of an OSN graph into patterns formed by spectral coordinates in the spectral space, and introduces the use of the spectral graph perturbation theory to more easily model and capture changes of spectral coordinates for attacker, victim, and regular nodes.  Further, this research develops spectral-analysis-based detection approaches for complex networks where nodes can carry attributes and edges can be negative, weighted, or asymmetric.  Through a novel combination of the network dynamics and the vector autoregressive model, it develops an automatic spectral-analysis-based approach to detecting dynamic attacks while avoiding the high cost and low accuracy of traditional approaches.  It also transforms attack characteristics from high-dimensional spectral spaces into distinctive visual patterns, and develops interactive mechanisms for analysts to incorporate domain knowledge and flexibly handle attacks.  The research team will build a simulation framework to evaluate the detection approaches against different types of OSN attacks, where one can plug in different OSN datasets to evaluate and compare different detection approaches.  Moreover, the research team will build a prototype oSAFARI on top of an OSN, and evaluate how oSAFARI can withstand various attacks in a real setting."

Genes provide the potential for functions an organism can carry out under the right conditions, and genes are expressed to make sure cells can perform the functions they need to live in their environment. Each gene can have a family of expressed forms, and their relationships can be very difficult to sort out without the sequence of the gene itself for comparison, but that sequence is missing for most organisms. The view of gene expression obtained from such experiments is typically fractured, incomplete, and difficult to analyze, the central problem this research addresses. Once reliable analysis methods are worked out, this research will produce software tools that use the methods and are designed to take common errors and missing parts of the data into account. As a check, the reconstructed gene sequences will be compared to known genes in related organisms, and strong relationships will be used to guide predictions of the genes' functions. All predictions will carry with them a number indicating the uncertainty of the information. To ground the research in a biologically interesting question the methods and software will be used to study plants that use an unusual form of energy conversion, C4 photosynthesis, and compare it to the more common form used by plants in order to investigate the different genetic mechanisms, including regulation, used by each type of plant. Predictions will be tested with wet-lab experiments, and analysis methods will then be improved as needed. An on-line community that shares the interests of the researchers will be created and fostered by providing expert advice for carrying out and analyzing similar experiments. <br/><br/>This project will consist of the development of a novel collection of methods, and an integrated set of tools, for the analysis of de novo transcriptomes. There are currently a number of tools that aim to tackle different phases of the de novo transcriptome analysis pipeline (e.g. assembly, clustering, expression quantification and differential expression testing), but none of these provide a well-integrated, principled and efficient approach to this difficult challenge. The methods developed and validated in this project will provide a state-of-the-art pipeline for posing and answering a host of relevant biological questions about how transcripts, genes, and functional modules are differentially expressed and regulated; specifically, in the context of organisms for which a reference genome is lacking.  The project will result in the development of novel methods for the data-driven clustering of contigs in de novo assemblies.  Clustering will be decided on the basis of sequence and expression-level similarities between contigs, accounting for known hallmarks of mis-assemblies to determine contigs that arise from the same underlying transcript. Transcripts will be grouped by predicted, shared exonic structure to discover sub-genic features, genes, and gene families.  The result of this process will be a hierarchical model of the transcriptome.  New methods for efficient quantification and differential expression analysis of these hierarchical models will be developed, including a methodologically-sound approach for propagating measures of quantification uncertainty into downstream analysis.  Finally, these tools will be validated via a large-scale reanalysis of existing de novo transcriptome data targeted at elucidating the identity of genetic regulatory elements involved in C4 photosynthesis. This reanalysis will harness the increased accuracy and efficiency of the methods developed to analyze data from all previous non-model C4 RNA-seq experiments in a single, multi-scale model. The output of the model will be a system for quantitatively prioritizing candidate regulatory elements for detailed molecular investigation. This project also includes broader impact goals that will provide research opportunities to undergraduate students, and which will create an actively-maintained and inclusive online community centered around best practices in de novo transcriptome analysis and experimental design.<br/><br/>For further information regarding progress on this project, including the relevant software being developed, please visit https://combine-lab.github.io/txome."

Large numbers of species are transported globally through international trade and human traffic. Non-native species invade myriad habitats that include natural areas, agricultural landscapes, and timber forests, altering natural ecological communities, reducing ecosystem services, and causing economic losses that are estimated at up to billions of dollars annually. Damages and costs increase further as invasive species spread across larger regions. Understanding the conditions that facilitate and prevent range expansion are critical to both predicting the spread of invasive species and informing species conservation efforts. At species range edges, natural and human-assisted movement interplay with local population dynamics in complex ways to determine spread dynamics. This project centers on a fundamental question: What are the drivers of species range expansion and how do multiple processes interact to shape invasion patterns? Researchers will address this question by studying the invasion pattern of an infamous North American invader, the gypsy moth. The gypsy moth periodically defoliates large tracts of hardwood forest, negatively affecting ecological communities, timber production, and recreational activities. The gypsy moth invasion front stretches from Minnesota to North Carolina and is expanding at an average rate of approximately 10 kilometers per year. Knowledge gaps filled by this project will inform management and conservation strategies to ultimately reduce the environmental and economic costs of non-native invaders and maintain biodiversity in the United States.<br/><br/>The researchers will use an exhaustive spatiotemporal dataset that annually quantifies the 2000 km long range edge of the gypsy moth. This project combines cutting-edge landscape genetics with detailed analyses of local population dynamics to inform model simulations used to elucidate how local population processes, landscape connectivity, and anthropogenic movement of this species interact to drive spread patterns. The proposed research tests hypotheses associated with three main objectives: 1) quantify effects of landscape features and spatial covariance on the dynamics of low-density populations, 2) use spatial genetic lineages to understand how landscape features and human traffic patterns affect genetic structure and movement, and 3) integrate demographic and genetic information to determine how landscape features, human movement, and local population processes drive large-scale invasion patterns by simulating invasion on layered maps of population dynamic and movement parameters."

Knowing how plant genetics relates to growth in stressful conditions, and whether soils contain ""friends or foes"" that improve or reduce plant growth is key to predicting the future success or failure of environmentally and economically important plants. This project will explore how plant genetics and soil organisms (bacteria and fungi) can help plants perform well where they are now or help them in new sites if their current environment becomes more stressful. This project builds on 15 years of research demonstrating genetic links between plants, soil organisms and soil fertility in different types of places. These genetic links maintain the diversity of plants and soil organisms and determine how energy flows through ecosystems at large scales. The results will provide land managers fundamental insights into how trees respond to environmental stresses, such as rising temperatures, longer and more severe droughts, and nitrogen pollution. Identification of soil organisms that influence plant health will be applicable to a wide range of environmental change issues. The study will provide training in diverse lab and field techniques and opportunities to develop independent research projects to several undergraduate students. <br/><br/>With the rapid rate of environmental change, plant populations that are well adapted to sites today are likely to be locally maladapted in the future. As stress causes plant populations to adapt or migrate to more favorable habitats, predicting adaptation will rely on understanding patterns of genetic diversity, while migrations will be determined by factors that influence species range dynamics. Since plants experience multiple abiotic and biotic environments simultaneously that affect their performance, it is critical to study genetic resources under realistic conditions that incorporate interacting species such as soil bacteria, fungi, and archaea (i.e., the soil microbiome). Current research shows that genetic variation in plant-soil-microbiome linkages will dictate how above- and belowground systems respond to global change. The goal of this study is to discover plant genetic and soil microbiome mechanisms that allow or impede plant adaptation and migration in response to environmental change. To achieve this, the project will conduct a greenhouse experiment to characterize plant genetic-soil microbe-abiotic environment interactions along experimental gradients of temperature, water availability, and soil nitrogen based on previous field surveys. Researchers will measure plant and soil responses across the gradients, plant-soil conditioning effects, and soil community effects on ecologically important plant traits. In addition, they will identify specific combinations of plant genotypes, soil microbiomes, and abiotic environments that result in nonadditive effects on plant productivity and nutrient dynamics. This approach will provide insight for ecological feedbacks that are important to: 1) non-additive responses of plants to abiotic stressors; 2) the maintenance of plant genetic variation and soil microbial phylogenetic diversity; and 3) resilience and stability of soil nutrient pools (e.g., C and N)."

The deep penetration problem contains virtually all the challenges that geomechanicians may face: large displacements, large rotations, large strains, strain localization, crushing, and a moving soil-metal boundary. The impact of the research therefore is dual: it will advance the understanding of a problem with applications to diverse fields, including projectile penetration into the ground, design of pile foundations and interpretation of the cone penetration test, but it will also help advance the understanding of fundamental processes that happen in granular (particulate) media, such as strain localization and particle crushing and how all of these complex processes should be handled in computational simulations. Benefits for society therefore are multiple, including the general advancement of the science of granular media, economies in foundation design, a better understanding of an application (projectile penetration) that is vital to the defense industry, the production of a database of images that can be used in education and research, and the training of researchers in advanced technology and computer simulations.<br/><br/>The research specifically uses the powerful combination of calibration chamber testing and the digital image correlation (DIC) technique to study cone penetration in crushable sands. A unique half-cylindrical chamber with a flat Plexiglass wall that allows observation of the vertical motion of half-circular penetrometers will be used to acquire images of the penetration process under various conditions with state-of-the-art high-resolution digital cameras and microscopes. The images will be processed in two ways: using DIC to obtain the displacement and strain fields in the soil and an algorithm that produces the particle size distribution of the soil from an image of it. The penetration resistance, local stresses, and the displacement and strain field dataset may be viewed as an experimental solution to the penetration boundary-value problem. Particle size gradation will be assessed during the entire penetration process, thereby enabling the research team to consider the relationship between crushing, wherever it occurs, penetration resistance and the displacement and strain fields. The calibration chamber tests are complemented by a complete laboratory testing program to produce data that can later be used in validation of theoretical simulations and development of methods of analysis and design. The high-quality experimental data will include data from tests in a unique Hopkinson bar especially designed to test soil under uniaxial or triaxial conditions. Work will also be done to advance computational simulation capabilities of penetration problems using the material point method."

Chirik of Princeton University is supported by the Chemical Catalysis program in the Division of Chemistry to develop efficient catalysts from Earth-abundant metals for the sustainable synthesis of single enantiomer drug-like molecules.  This Grant Opportunities for Academic Liaisons with Industry (GOALI) project is conducted in collaboration with Dr. Rebecca T Ruck of Merck & Co., Inc.  Single enantiomer compounds, those that can be distinguished from their mirror image counterparts much like a pair of hands often exhibit unique biological function and constituted two-thirds of FDA drugs approved in 2015. Preparing these chiral compounds as single enantiomers, or hands, is often challenging but transition metal catalysis has revolutionized the field by providing direct routes to these compounds from abundant precursors. Traditional catalysts often rely on the rarest elements on Earth and raise concerns about the overall sustainability, carbon dioxide (CO2) footprint and toxicity of these processes. The research team focuses on new reactions unique to Earth abundant transition metals that are desirable for sustainable reactions.  Interfacing with the Merck team provides access to high throughput experimentation, a technique that enables rapid evaluation of numerous chemical reactions in parallel. This approach, coupled with molecular understanding developed at Princeton, enables rational catalyst design and generates insights that enables new sustainable synthetic methods as well as diagnostics to probe drug safety and efficacy within the pharmaceutical industry. Through an industrial-academic partnership advances are possible that would not be had the two group acted independently. These studies also provide fundamental catalyst design principles that may ultimately translate to other areas of catalysis beyond of the pharmaceutical industry. In addition, students and postdocs involved in the project gain unique experience working with industrial chemists and gain invaluable career advice and mentorship not typically found in traditional graduate programs. <br/><br/>Transition metal catalysis has revolutionized chemical synthesis and is a key component of sustainable chemistry. Use of Earth-abundant rather than precious metals is not only economically and environmentally advantageous but the variable electronic structures, density of states, and coordination geometries that are available with first row transition metals open pathways for new chemical reactivity. The intellectual merit of this proposal lies in the rational application of electronic structure control to address long-standing challenges in base metal catalysis with applications in the pharmaceutical industry. Sustainable methods for the preparation of single enantiomer compounds and the reduction of heterocycles are described. Hydrogenation catalysts that operate by 3 distinct mechanisms, differentiated by the method of electron flow during catalytic turnover, are investigated. Access to distinct reaction channels involving both homolytic and heterolytic bond activation from similar catalyst platforms is unique to base metals and improves the likelihood for success to overcome long-standing challenges such as enantioselective heteroarene hydrogenation and reduction of substrates lacking coordinating functionality. High throughput experimentation (HTE) coupled with physical inorganic spectroscopy, structural chemistry and magnetism provide a unique opportunity to solve fundamental and applied problems in chemical catalysis. Guided by pharmaceutically relevant targets, focus is devoted to Earth-abundant metal catalysts that improve the speed, diversity, complexity and sustainability of transformations used in drug discovery."

A primary goal of speciation research is to uncover the genetic differences between species that underlie reproductive isolation. While much of the work in this field has focused on identifying specific genes that contribute to reproductive isolation between species, gene regulation may play a large role in this process. Despite this, there are been few systematic attempts to link regulatory evolution to reproductive isolation. Characterizing regulatory evolution between house mouse subspecies will provide novel insight into how regulatory networks evolve and diverge which has broad implications for our understanding of the evolution of complex phenotypes as well as the speciation process. In addition, the investigators will engage in research with undergraduates from underrepresented groups and provide public and K12 outreach on this project.<br/><br/>Taking advantage of a cross between house mouse subspecies, where hybrid dysfunction is largely unidirectional, the proposed work will use a variety of genomic methods (i.e., ChiP-sequencing, mRNA-sequencing, and ribosome profiling) to characterize changes in gene regulation on the transcriptional and translational level that are associated with hybrid sterility. This dissertation work will address the following questions: 1) What is the role of different levels of gene regulation to species divergence? and 2) What is the role of regulatory divergence in reproductive isolation between species? The work outlined here will be the first to: 1) characterize divergence in translational efficiency between mammalian species, and 2) examine the relationship between hybrid sterility and gene regulation on the transcriptional and translational level."

Often, particularly in computer science and cyber security, important quantities can be described by the set of solutions to a system of polynomial equations with rational coefficients, in other words by an algebraic variety. This project is concerned with determining when such a system has a solution where all coordinates are rational numbers. For an arbitrary system of equations, it can be quite difficult to determine whether there exist any such rational solutions. This research project develops a new perspective on this problem using geometry and asymptotic behavior. The research in this proposal is complemented by educational and outreach activities, including workshops for mid-to-late career graduate students focusing on presentation skills and how these skills can be leveraged to develop and broaden one's research program. <br/><br/>The research projects fall in two main directions. The first focuses on the change in behavior of rational points and obstructions as the base field varies. In this direction, the project pursues a direct connection between the existence of 0-cycles and rational points on geometrically rational surfaces and explores new asymptotic questions that will shed light on Colliot-Thélène's conjecture on 0-cycles. The second focuses on leveraging dominant rational maps emanating from a variety X to obtain information about the Brauer group, rational points, and 0-cycles of X."

However, diverse manufacturing limits make current mobile devices far from ideal for being used anytime, anywhere. Traditional solutions design individual mobile devices for different application scenarios by exploring tradeoffs among the various design perspectives, but cannot scale to the increasing complexity and performance requirements of future mobile applications. Instead, the vision of this project is Interconnected Mobile Computing (IMC), which fully interconnects multiple mobile devices owned by the same user via wireless networks and allows these devices to complement each other via cooperative resource sharing. IMC aims to fundamentally remove the physical boundary between mobile devices and hence augment the mobile computing capability provided to the user. The success of this research could fully unleash the potential of heterogeneous mobile devices and allow insertion of highly pervasive and cognitive mobile applications into every aspect of human life. The results from this research are likely to foster new research directions on mobile computing and benefit a broader scope of cyber-physical systems such as industry control, remote sensing and connected healthcare. The project will actively apply the research results into development of undergraduate curriculum, engage under-represented students into research, and exploit the research outcomes for K-12 educational and outreach programs. <br/><br/>This project intends to develop key enabling technologies in wireless networks and mobile systems that ensure the efficiency, adaptability and generality of IMC.  More specifically, this project consists of three closely intertwined research thrusts: (i) reducing the wireless transmission latency of resource sharing between mobile devices by designing an extra wireless communication channel that dedicates to IMC; ii) ensuring adaptability of resource sharing to various network and system dynamics by designing distributed network algorithms for resource sharing decisions; and iii) systematically supporting generic resource access between remote mobile systems via development of new mobile OS interfaces. The proposed technical designs will be implemented and evaluated over a medium-scale mobile testbed of software-defined radios and off-the-shelf mobile devices, and will also be validated by large-scale trace-based emulation."

New parasite species can often form following infection of a novel host species if barriers to successful reproduction between parasites on the two species exist. This project combines observational, experimental, and genomic studies of a native parasitic plant, desert mistletoe, to address this question. While showing the same epidemiological patterns as many other parasites, parasitic plants allow for direct tests of hypotheses concerning the evolution of barriers to mating in diverging parasite lineages that would be infeasible in other systems. This research will help elucidate the poorly understood ecological mechanisms that promote parasite speciation and adaptation to novel hosts. The potential for studying parallel evolution of parasites undergoing ongoing diversification provides a unique opportunity to study the genomics of species interactions. Additionally, the researchers will disseminate the results to a broad audience through collaborations with local outreach groups interested in native plants and will contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This work will test established theory about the relative roles of pre-zygotic and post-zygotic isolation mechanisms in sympatry and allopatry using two host races of a native aerial hemiparasite of plants, Phoradendron californicum (Viscaceae), across their overlapping ranges. Populations of the host races infecting catclaw acacia (Senegalia greggii ) and velvet mesquite (Prosopis velutina) in sympatry (locally interspersed) and allopatry (> 3 km from nearest infected host of other species) will be studied at multiple sites across Arizona. The researchers will conduct selection gradient analyses for flowering time across these populations to test if selection for divergent flowering times (a pre-zygotic isolation mechanism) between the host races is stronger in sympatry than in allopatry. Additionally, the researchers will perform hand-pollination experiments to quantify the cost of mating between host races and the strength of late-acting barriers to gene flow. Finally, population genomic analyses of mistletoes from these host races using RAD sequencing will reveal whether host races are the result of a single host-switching event or repeated, parallel divergence and reinforcement across the range. The researchers will further use the sequence data to investigate the genomic signature of host race formation and adaptation to host species in this parasitic plant."

However, it turns out that there are natural and important mathematical theories that cannot be decided within ZFC alone. The Large Cardinal Axioms (LCAs) are extensions of ZFC designed to settle all such theories. Thus LCAs pursue Godel's program in set theory. How can one test for ""correctness"" of an LCA? The inner model program, a major program in modern set theory, justifies correctness by constructing canonical models for LCAs much like the natural numbers are the canonical model for the Peano Axioms of arithmetic (PA) (and as such PA is a correct theory). This research project contributes to the inner model program by advancing methods for constructing canonical models for LCAs from various extensions of ZFC. <br/><br/>The project focuses on studying the connections between inner models, sets of reals, hybrid structures (such as hereditarily ordinal definable sets (HOD) of determinacy models), forcing, and strong combinatorial principles (such as the Proper Forcing Axiom (PFA), (generalizations of) the tree property, the Unique Branch Hypothesis (UBH)). This research project aims to advance the basic theory of hybrid structures, as well as developing methods for the core model induction beyond its current state. In particular, the project aims to make advancements in answering two fundamental questions in descriptive inner model theory: (1) Is HOD of a determinacy model fine-structural (e.g. do the Generalized Continuum Hypothesis (GCH) and various square principles hold in HOD)? (2) What is the consistency strength of PFA?"

Researchers can make a detailed exploration of scientific design alternatives under a wide set of operating environments using runs from a simulator of a physical system, possibly coupled with those from a traditional physical system experiment. This research project will advance the statistical modeling, design, and analysis of experiments that use computer simulators. The first research area is Improved Modeling of Simulator Output: The investigators will develop flexible stochastic models that will allow more accurate prediction in settings where the simulator provides related multivariate output of the performance of a physical system. Current prediction models either assume output independence (knowledge of one output gives no information about other outputs) or a linear dependence on a common set of latent drivers. The second research area concerns Advances in Emulation: The investigators aim to devise efficient emulators of simulator output for novel input and output settings such as when gradient information is available or when the output consists of both point and integrated measures. They plan to construct predictors that incorporate natural invariances present in the simulator output. For example, the predicted response should be constant under permutations of the inputs when the output satisfies this condition; the project will quantify the uncertainty in the invariant predictors. The investigators also plan to quantify the uncertainty of a recent, theoretically-justified method of calibrating computer simulators based on physical experimental data. The third research area is the Design of Simulator Experiments: Efficient designs of simulator experiments will be devised to minimize the computational effort required to determine the sensitivity of a simulator output to each of its inputs. <br/><br/>This research will build a statistical framework for the modeling, design and analysis of experiments that employ computer simulators. The specific goals are (1) to devise flexible interpolating stochastic models for computer simulators with multivariate output; (2) to invent efficient predictors for novel input and output settings such as when gradient information is available or when the output consists of both point and integrated responses; (3) to develop emulators of simulator output that incorporate the same invariances present in the simulator responses; (4) to quantify the uncertainty of L2 calibrated predictors for expensive computer codes; and (5) to construct new sliced Latin hypercube designs to allow the efficient calculation of global sensitivity indices. The investigators will develop new modes for training statistics graduate students having interests in engineering applications. Opportunities will be created for subject matter specialists to provide critical practical challenges in three areas: aerospace/mechanical engineering, biomechanics, and material science, and to conduct joint applied projects with the researchers."

In order to build trustworthy and secure OSNs, it has become critical to develop techniques to analyze and detect OSN fraud and attacks.  Existing OSN security approaches usually target a specific type of OSN fraud or attack and often fall short of detecting more complex attacks such as collusive attacks that involve many fraudulent OSN accounts, or dynamic attacks that encompass multiple attack phases over time.  This research, dubbed oSAFARI (Online SociAl network Fraud and Attack Research and Identification), models, analyzes and characterizes OSN frauds and attacks; designs, develops, and evaluates a new approach to detecting static OSN frauds and attacks; and further enhances the approach to handle dynamic attacks with multiple phases.  The research team plans to develop a new course focused on OSN attacks and defenses, which has the potential to be offered across many institutions.  To increase public security awareness, the team also plans to develop tutorial courses on typical OSN attacks and their defense and offer them at popular public events and in freshman classes.  The research team will broadly disseminate their results, tools, software, and documents to the research community, IT industries, and to OSN companies.<br/> <br/>This project embraces a systematic, comprehensive study of OSN frauds and attacks.  It models OSN threats by viewing an OSN as a graph embedded with attacker nodes and edges, identifies and analyzes specific forms of frauds and attacks, and evaluates state-of-the-art attack analysis and defense approaches.  It develops a spectral-analysis-based framework for OSN fraud and attack detection.  The framework transforms topological information of an OSN graph into patterns formed by spectral coordinates in the spectral space, and introduces the use of the spectral graph perturbation theory to more easily model and capture changes of spectral coordinates for attacker, victim, and regular nodes.  Further, this research develops spectral-analysis-based detection approaches for complex networks where nodes can carry attributes and edges can be negative, weighted, or asymmetric.  Through a novel combination of the network dynamics and the vector autoregressive model, it develops an automatic spectral-analysis-based approach to detecting dynamic attacks while avoiding the high cost and low accuracy of traditional approaches.  It also transforms attack characteristics from high-dimensional spectral spaces into distinctive visual patterns, and develops interactive mechanisms for analysts to incorporate domain knowledge and flexibly handle attacks.  The research team will build a simulation framework to evaluate the detection approaches against different types of OSN attacks, where one can plug in different OSN datasets to evaluate and compare different detection approaches.  Moreover, the research team will build a prototype oSAFARI on top of an OSN, and evaluate how oSAFARI can withstand various attacks in a real setting."

Its collections of over 700,000 specimens are used for research, education, and to inform conservation decisions. Implementation of the planned activities will secure this biodiversity data resource for the advancement of scientific research. Specifically, the value and security of the MVZ collections will be enhanced through upgrades to the storage conditions of the ornithology collection. Also, rare specimens and associated information will be cataloged and made accessible, potentially increasing their use in research and informing resource management decisions. The collection includes species that are protected and poorly represented in most museum collections. Additionally, some samples are important for understanding disease spread, reproduction, physiology, and population changes over time. The project will leverage existing outreach efforts at the museum and continue the museum's tradition of student mentorship and training. This will, in part, be achieved through a workshop on the curation and use of museum data. Students and postgraduates will be trained in curation methods, modern collection management and data standards.<br/><br/>This project has two major goals: (1) Enhance pest protection of the MVZ Ornithology collection by replacing a subset of the bird specimen cases to protect against future infestations. This aspect of the project focuses on passerine skins as they comprise the bulk of the MVZ bird collection, are the most actively growing part of the collection, and are most heavily used by researchers. The work performed will also involve reorganization of the collection to reflect current published taxonomies, facilitating its use for research and teaching. (2) Provide long-term security of Ornithology and Herpetology specimens and data by cataloging 14 special acquisitions. Over 3,000 specimens in Ornithology and over 19,000 in Herpetology have been accepted through special donations and specimen transfers of orphaned collections since 1995. These acquisitions include: unique series or specimen preparations not found in other museum collections; specimens of historic and/or geographic relevance to NSF-funded research aimed at documenting faunal change over the past century; and rare and/or endangered and globally diverse amphibian specimens used for studying the effects of deadly chytrid fungus. These acquisitions contain critically important, but currently inaccessible data for scientific research and discovery and they enhance knowledge about biodiversity and environmental change through species, data, and geographic areas that are underrepresented in museum collections. By cataloging these collections, the specimens will be secured long-term and available more quickly to the scientific community. The MVZ is a leader in biodiversity data projects, and all data will be made available globally through Arctos, VertNet, iDigBio, GBIF, and other data portals. Broader impacts of this project include a webcast Digital Curation and Data Quality Workshop and new public displays that further the MVZ's mission. Plans are to develop new community outreach across multiple age groups, and recruit and train new students, postgraduates, and interns. The principal investigators will mentor and/or employ 20 individuals and train an additional 35 participants through the workshop and webcast."

Unfortunately, very few of these nanomaterials have made it to the marketplace due to challenges with scaling up their manufacturing and finding low-cost and 'green' or environmentally-benign methods to make them at an industrial scale. However, nature does an excellent job of reproducibly making complex metal and semiconductor nanomaterials.

Biomineralization, the process by which living organisms produce minerals, typically results in a composite system where the mineral forms the structural frame while an organic component assumes the biological function. Nacre, a shell material also known as mother of pearl, is a representative example, being composed of a large fraction of inorganic calcium carbonate (hard and brittle) and a small fraction of protein (soft and tough). Their combination in a layered structure leads to the outstanding mechanical properties in contrast to the individual components. Such carefully organized composites have inspired scientists to synthesize materials with a similar structure at a large scale for practical applications, but their efforts have not yet proven successful. The basic challenge is the difficulty of incorporating a large concentration of inorganic nanomaterials into a polymer system, and simultaneously achieving a high level of organization. This award supports fundamental research to explore a facile approach to prepare hybrid materials with a nacre-like microstructure and to achieve similar outstanding mechanical properties and other important functionalities. By taking advantage of flow-induced orientation of disc-like particles, the manufacturing of materials at a high rate appears to be possible. The composite films prepared through this approach should find application in packaging with improved barrier properties and corrosion resistance. Fully integrated within this project are activities to increase the interest in science and technology among the younger generation, particularly those in underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This research will lead to a thorough understanding of the fundamental mechanisms for the flow induced orientation and stacking of platelets that can help lead to optimal alignment of these particles in composite films to mimic the nacre structure. Factors such as flow rate, system viscosity, nanosheet concentration and aspect ratio, and related chemistry will be systematically investigated to address two fundamental questions. First, how do these factors affect the alignment and packing of nanosheets? Secondly, how will the interface between the nanosheets and the polymer binder affect the final thin film properties? In addition to the nacre-like structure and properties, the researchers also aim to further expand the scope to the formation of three-dimensional hybrid materials, such as bones, by properly tailoring the microstructure of the organic and inorganic components."

Fiber-reinforced polymer composites are made by combining a polymer together with strong reinforcing fibers. Both glass and carbon fibers are relatively expensive, man-made fibers. However natural fibers are abundant, recyclable and cheap. There is a growing trend to use natural fiber reinforced composites in several commercial applications such as automobiles, building construction, sporting goods, and electronic goods. Although natural fiber composites are already used in several industrial applications, their use in load bearing applications is very limited due to their poor durability and mechanical properties such as stiffness, strength, crack initiation and propagation resistance. Multi-functional properties such as stiffness, strength and crack resistance, and damage sensing will be achieved by coating natural fibers with graphene and embedding short carbon fibers between the laminates. In addition, research will be performed to understand the damage evolution of the natural composites under various mechanical loads using the three-dimensional electrical conductive network generated by the embedded graphene and short carbon fiber elements. This project will provide training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students on embedding graphene into natural fibers, fabrication of composites, and multi-scale electro-mechanical characterization. The research activities will also promote the recruitment and mentoring of underrepresented students in cutting-edge scientific techniques through outreach in local public high schools.<br/><br/>A comprehensive experimental study will be conducted to investigate damage evolution at different length scales in multi-functional natural fiber reinforced composites. To accomplish this objective, novel and challenging experiments incorporating the electro-mechanical response of three dimensional electrical conductive networks will be performed under quasi-static mechanical loading conditions. Highly sensitive conductive networks will be generated by embedding graphene in natural fibers laminates along in-plane directions, and by flocking short carbon fibers along the thickness direction between the laminates. It is hypothesized that the generated conductive network will undergo changes during mechanical loads to reflect damage mechanisms such as fiber pulling from the laminates, matrix cracking, delamination between laminates, and crack bridging. In addition to macro-scale experiments, nano-scale experiments will also be performed using a micro-tensile tester embedded, conductive mode atomic force microscope to capture change in current profile under tensile and shearing loading conditions."

This research will also be used as an active learning tool during a course specifically designed for first-year undergraduate students from historically underrepresented groups in the biological sciences.<br/>	<br/>The vole genus, Microtus, is a model system to investigate the process of speciation because it has a diversification rate 60-100 times higher than other vertebrates. The distribution of genetic variation within the field vole (Microtus agrestis) has been heavily shaped by glacial cycles. The species includes distinct evolutionary lineages that survived in separate glacial refugia during recent glacial maxima and are highly differentiated. This research will focus on a hybrid zone between two of these lineages and use transcriptome sequencing to identify fixed genetic differences between them. These genomic regions will serve as targets for subsequent analyses of individuals from across the hybrid zone. Using genomic cline analyses that consider the genetic composition of individuals across this transect, researchers will characterize variation across the hybrid zone revealing loci that show restricted introgression. These loci will be considered candidate genes related to reproductive isolation responding to factors, such as selective differences associated with the differing environments of the hybridizing forms, and genetic incompatibilities between them. The results from these analyses will provide a conceptual and empirical groundwork for the genetic architecture underlying speciation driven by isolation in glacial refugia and provide a set of candidate loci to investigate speciation in other mammalian groups."

Currently, more than 90 percent of the liquid transportation fuels used in the U.S. are petroleum-based. It is imperative to develop alternative liquid fuels that are domestically produced and environmentally benign. Biofuels, derived from cellulosic biomass such as agricultural and forestry residues and dedicated energy crops, offer one of the best near- to mid-term alternatives. Size reduction of cellulosic biomass is the key step in the manufacturing of biofuels. Size reduction is an energy intensive process, and particle size dictates the energy consumption in this process. This award supports research to understand the relationship between cellulosic biomass particle size and biofuel yield. Successful completion of this research will build a foundation for future biofuel manufacturing technologies. This research will have a significant impact on the overall cost and energy balance of biofuel manufacturing, greatly benefiting the U.S. economy and energy security, as well as the environment and society, in general. This project will have a positive impact on engineering education. A new course accompanied by hands-on lab sessions will be created to strengthen the undergraduate engineering curricula and engage students in participating projects on renewable energy manufacturing. <br/><br/>The research objective is to test three hypotheses to explain inconsistency in the relationship between cellulosic biomass particle size and enzymatic hydrolysis sugar yield. In this research, it is hypothesized that the inconsistences are caused by the use of different sugar yield definitions, particle size ranges, and pretreatment methods. The prevailing biofuel manufacturing technology and the three most widely used cellulosic biomass currently in the industry, wheat straw, corn stover, and switchgrass, will be used in the research. Experimental investigations on both lab and pilot scale biofuel conversion facilities will be conducted to test the hypotheses. Additionally, structural features, morphological changes, and chemical compositions of cellulosic biomass will be characterized by using electron microscopy, x-ray diffraction analysis, UV spectrophotometry, high performance liquid chromatography, IR spectroscopy, Simon's stain, and nuclear magnetic resonance techniques. Based on the experimental results, a sugar yield model, incorporating all the significant structural, morphological, and chemical features, will be developed and validated. The outcome of this research will provide insights in the dynamic degradation of sugar compounds during hydrolysis. It will advance the knowledge base needed to make both strategic and operational decisions in biofuel manufacturing."

Large numbers of species are transported globally through international trade and human traffic. Non-native species invade myriad habitats that include natural areas, agricultural landscapes, and timber forests, altering natural ecological communities, reducing ecosystem services, and causing economic losses that are estimated at up to billions of dollars annually. Damages and costs increase further as invasive species spread across larger regions. Understanding the conditions that facilitate and prevent range expansion are critical to both predicting the spread of invasive species and informing species conservation efforts. At species range edges, natural and human-assisted movement interplay with local population dynamics in complex ways to determine spread dynamics. This project centers on a fundamental question: What are the drivers of species range expansion and how do multiple processes interact to shape invasion patterns? Researchers will address this question by studying the invasion pattern of an infamous North American invader, the gypsy moth. The gypsy moth periodically defoliates large tracts of hardwood forest, negatively affecting ecological communities, timber production, and recreational activities. The gypsy moth invasion front stretches from Minnesota to North Carolina and is expanding at an average rate of approximately 10 kilometers per year. Knowledge gaps filled by this project will inform management and conservation strategies to ultimately reduce the environmental and economic costs of non-native invaders and maintain biodiversity in the United States.<br/><br/>The researchers will use an exhaustive spatiotemporal dataset that annually quantifies the 2000 km long range edge of the gypsy moth. This project combines cutting-edge landscape genetics with detailed analyses of local population dynamics to inform model simulations used to elucidate how local population processes, landscape connectivity, and anthropogenic movement of this species interact to drive spread patterns. The proposed research tests hypotheses associated with three main objectives: 1) quantify effects of landscape features and spatial covariance on the dynamics of low-density populations, 2) use spatial genetic lineages to understand how landscape features and human traffic patterns affect genetic structure and movement, and 3) integrate demographic and genetic information to determine how landscape features, human movement, and local population processes drive large-scale invasion patterns by simulating invasion on layered maps of population dynamic and movement parameters."

Insects make up much of the animal life that has evolved on Earth. Understanding why there are so many different kinds of insects and why they are so successful is fundamental to understanding how the wide diversity of life evolved. Insects are well known for producing many different chemical compounds that are required for their communication. Some chemicals help them to locate mates and food resources, others help them to organize activities within the nest or hive, and many others are used to warn off and defend against predators. This project focuses on this last aspect and is specifically testing the idea that the genes responsible for production of the hot chemical spray of the bombardier beetles are closely related to the genes responsible for producing similar chemicals in the insect's outer shell or exoskeleton. A main strength of the project is that it tackles this question by using multiple complementary approaches and by comparing eight different beetle species that are related to varying degrees. Half of these species have evolved a chemical defense system, the other half have not evolved this ability. Many college students and young scientists will receive scientific training in conjunction with the project. People of all ages are highly captivated by these beetles, particularly school age children. With the bombardier beetle as a model, the project will help develop elementary school level hands-on activities and lesson plans on topics in chemical ecology and biological chemical defense evolution that will reinforce the Next Generation Science.<br/><br/>Ground beetles and their relatives form the largest clade of organisms that use a single homologous gland system to produce no less than 19 distinct classes of chemical compounds for defense. This project will develop a detailed functional and evolutionary understanding of defensive chemistry evolution by focusing on species from the four lineages of quinone producing carabid beetles, including species commonly known as the bombardier beetles, which chemically blast their defensive quinones at extremely hot temperatures (up to 100 °C). Using a multidisciplinary approach, this project will identify genes involved in quinone production, elucidate chemical biosynthetic pathways, and describe the genetic architecture of quinone evolution. From gland-specific transcripts, candidate genes related to the production of defensive secretions will be identified and gene function will be validated experimentally by blocking gene transcription and looking at phenotypic changes in the compounds produced. The researchers will test the hypothesis that the genes up-regulated in secretory cells during quinone synthesis are closely related to those involved in quinone production in arthropod cuticle. Thus the project will empirically address the well-known, but untested, scenario of how the bombardier beetle evolved its explosive defense abilities. Ultimately, this project will explore how genetics and chemistry can interact over time and will reveal insights into the fundamental process of evolution."

This study will leverage a large field campaign effort in Portugal, known as Perdigao, to study the stable boundary layer in complex topography.  Better understanding of turbulence and wind flow in complex terrain will improve numerical weather models and support critical applications such as air quality, aviation, wind energy, transportation, and climate modeling.  The project will also contribute to the education and training of the next generation of scientists and the researchers will contribute to public literacy of science through various outreach efforts.<br/><br/>The Perdigao field experiment is part of a large European campaign to improve the efficiency of wind energy production.  This award will bring in a basic research component with a focus on studying the mechanisms controlling turbulence intermittency in stable boundary layers in complex terrain.  This will be a combined observational and modeling effort, with additional observational data provided by the Univ. of Colorado at Boulder's Tethered Lifting System (TLS) and three profiling Lidars.  The modeling component will make use of the WRF model with an immersed boundary method (IBM) implemented in order to enable simulation over steep terrain surfaces, and the model simulations will be able to nest down to 5m in the horizontal and 0.5m in the vertical.  The researchers plan to address the following questions:  (i) What is the structure of turbulence budgets, especially turbulence dissipation rate, within and above the valley? How does it change with the evolution of stability, particularly under stable conditions? (ii) What mechanisms generate intermittency of the turbulence? How is the intermittent turbulence within and above the valley represented in large-eddy simulations? (iii) How are coherent structures affected by the wind turbine wake? How does this influence intermittency? (iv) What physical parameterizations and numerical techniques are needed to appropriately integrate mesoscale and microscale models in complex terrain?"

The ability to make thin films of these materials will enable new applications in electronics and energy conversion. However, in order to fully harness the potential of oxide films, new processing approaches are required that will enable a wider range of material compositions to be manufactured. This award supports fundamental research focused on developing and understanding strategies for the controlled substitution of fluorine for oxygen, thereby enabling new means to engineer electronic, optical, and magnetic properties of thin films and nanomaterials. The processing methods to be studied are scalable, require minimal capital investment, and can be carried out on a broad range of oxide films, independent of how the materials were first processed. As such, the research will directly support the nation's strategic goal of developing agile new approaches for materials processing that can reduce the time from material discovery to technological deployment. The research will also benefit the U.S. economy by contributing to the advanced engineering education of the participating students. <br/><br/>While advances in deposition techniques have enabled the processing of perovskite oxide films with monolayer precision, expanding access to new material chemistries remains a challenge. This project is focused on the substitution of fluorine for oxygen, which allows for control of the transition metal cation valence state and the covalency of the metalanion bond, both effects having profound implications for electronic, ferroic, and optical properties. This research will elucidate fundamental scientific mechanisms in the synthesis of oxyfluoride mixed-anion perovskites based on post-growth conversion reactions of oxide films. The conversion processes to be studied utilize vapor transport and anion diffusion from fluoropolymers. The team will deposit oxide films, carry out fluorination reactions, and utilize spectroscopic and structural characterization techniques to develop a predictive understanding of how the resultant anion composition can be engineered through processing conditions to tune functional properties."

Consequently, there is growing interest in understanding how invaders damage ecosystems and in developing management strategies to minimize their effects. Through manipulative field experiments and native-introduced range comparisons, this research will investigate how and when invasive yellowjackets express variation in their life cycle, specifically, whether their colonies die back (senescence) each year, or are perennial colonies. This project contributes to understanding of life cycle variation in insects, how such flexibility mediates ecological processes at the landscape scale, and what factors interact to influence perenniality. The research will help inform predictions as to how impacts of species invasions may respond to climate change. Furthermore, this project will provide insights into transmission of common diseases of wasps and their bee prey. As yellowjackets can be public nuisances, revealing the causes of perenniality may lead to the development of control methods that prevent the emergence of perenniality in this species and potentially in other species. In addition to providing research opportunities for undergraduates, the researchers will develop an educational activity on invasive social insects for K-6 children about the biology and potential hazards posed by social wasps.<br/><br/>This project focuses on invasive social wasps that have structural effects on the ecosystems that they invade. These wasps express plasticity in key life history traits (e.g. annual or perennial colony phenology), which greatly magnifies their ecological impacts. The researchers explicitly test how ecological and climatic factors interact to affect shifts in invader life history traits and ultimately modify invasion impacts. Specifically this research investigates how yellowjacket foraging behavior and colony phenology shift in response to diet subsidies, artificial warming of the nest to simulate mild climate, or both subsidies and artificial warming. Coupling such manipulations with landscape-scale prey population sampling, this project also quantifies subsequent invasion impacts on native prey. These experiments will provide insights as to how yellowjackets may respond to changes in pollinator populations and climate change. Furthermore, researchers will determine whether wasp consumption of honey bees influences pathogen load; this is particularly important as honey bee pathogens are increasingly detected in non-honey bee species. Pathogen screening will help distinguish whether (a) wasps increase their pathogen load by consuming bees, (b) whether wasps transmit pathogens through predation and raiding of beehives, and (c) identify differences in pathology between annual and perennial colonies. Understanding the factors affecting life history is vital for predicting how trait evolution or plasticity may respond to future global climate change."

If the original star is between eight and twenty times the mass of the sun, the supernova leaves behind a neutron star. Neutron stars are ultra-dense objects with the mass of the sun and a diameter of about 15 miles. Normal matter is made of atoms consisting of electrons and nuclei, nuclei are made of neutrons and protons, and neutrons and protons, in turn, are made of up and down quarks. The gravitational force in the center of a neutron star, however, is sufficient to compress neutrons and protons together so tightly that neutrons and protons may be forced to convert into exotic particles containing strange quarks. The question of whether or not strange quarks are present in neutron stars, and the more general question of the nature of extremely dense matter, are some of the principal questions facing the nuclear physics and astrophysics communities. This project aims to answer these questions and to determine the nature of matter in the center of neutron stars where gravity compresses matter to a thousand trillion times the density of water. This project involves training opportunities for students and postdoctoral fellow. Community outreach includes the education of students through the continued development of a Studio Physics course, involvement in research, and a web-based visualization of neutron stars.<br/><br/>Nuclear experiments and observations of neutron stars have successfully generated novel constraints on the equation of state of matter at densities near and above the central densities in atomic nuclei. However, our current understanding of high-densities is limited: we do not yet know the composition of the ground state. This project uses a combination of nuclear theory matched to nuclear data and neutron star observations to determine the composition of neutron star cores. Modern models of strongly-interacting matter will be combined with new nuclear structure calculations of neutron-rich nuclei in order to construct state of the art models of the neutron star crust and core. These models, and their concomitant uncertainties, will be calibrated with nuclear data and compared with neutron star cooling, mass, and radius observations. For example, neutron star cooling data has already given indications of fast cooling arising from a large proton-to-neutron ratio. This project will study the posterior probability distribution for the proton-to-neutron ratio and several other observables that will give insights into neutron star composition. <br/><br/>This proposal is co-funded by the Theoretical Nuclear Physics Program in the Physics Division and the Division of Astronomical Sciences at NSF."

Yet today, life has diversified into tens of millions of species. Reconstructing these evolutionary relationships is the aim of phylogenetics, and its insights are critical to nearly all areas of biology. The genomics revolution is radically altering the historically data-limited field of molecular phylogenetics and genome-scale data are now easily generated for any organism. Yet, simply collecting more genetic data, on its own, will not be sufficient to resolve difficult branches on the Tree of Life because some genes will support different evolutionary histories than others. This project addresses the questions of which genes and which DNA positions in those genes are most informative for resolving deep amphibian relationships, and conversely, which may be misleading. Amphibians (frogs, salamanders, and caecilians) are an ancient and diverse group typifying many of the difficulties of reconstructing deep phylogeny. The relationships among the three amphibian orders have proven one of the most difficult portions of the vertebrate phylogeny to resolve. This work may serve as a general framework for tackling thorny problems in phylogenetics and builds important avenues for graduate training in bioinformatics, high-throughput sequencing analysis, and model-based phylogenetic reconstruction - key skills in this post-genomic era. The research will integrate undergraduate researchers from traditionally under-represented groups across rural Appalachia and Kentucky. This research is of broad interest to evolutionary biologists working on amphibians, and stands to make important contributions to amphibian systematics. It addresses questions about how we analyze genomic data to accurately reconstruct deep evolutionary relationships.<br/><br/>	The researchers will test hypotheses about the source of conflicting phylogenetic signals from mitochondrial and nuclear genomes by analyzing site-specific patterns of topological support across nuclear genes that interact with the mitochondrion and ribosomes. The researchers will use a well-developed amphibian system in which previous analyses of complete mitochondrial genomes, nuclear ribosomal RNA, and >300 putatively neutral nuclear exons have each strongly supported conflicting scenarios for basal amphibian divergences. This project tests the hypothesis that mitochondrial and ribosomal genes and their nuclear-encoded functional counterparts support the same tree topologies due to compensatory co-evolution between mitochondrial and nuclear genomes. Leveraging genomic resources, the researchers will develop a targeted capture kit to sequence multiple exons of 225 nuclear genes that functionally interact with the mitochondrion and ribosomes in 144 amphibian taxa, representing each major lineage. Examining the relative support for different inter-ordinal topologies across sites in each locus, and with knowledge of which portions of these nuclear loci physically interact with rRNA or mitochondrial-encoded proteins, this project will test whether particular nuclear-encoded genes yield conflicting topologies because of constraints on organellar structure and function."

Researchers can make a detailed exploration of scientific design alternatives under a wide set of operating environments using runs from a simulator of a physical system, possibly coupled with those from a traditional physical system experiment. This research project will advance the statistical modeling, design, and analysis of experiments that use computer simulators. The first research area is Improved Modeling of Simulator Output: The investigators will develop flexible stochastic models that will allow more accurate prediction in settings where the simulator provides related multivariate output of the performance of a physical system. Current prediction models either assume output independence (knowledge of one output gives no information about other outputs) or a linear dependence on a common set of latent drivers. The second research area concerns Advances in Emulation: The investigators aim to devise efficient emulators of simulator output for novel input and output settings such as when gradient information is available or when the output consists of both point and integrated measures. They plan to construct predictors that incorporate natural invariances present in the simulator output. For example, the predicted response should be constant under permutations of the inputs when the output satisfies this condition; the project will quantify the uncertainty in the invariant predictors. The investigators also plan to quantify the uncertainty of a recent, theoretically-justified method of calibrating computer simulators based on physical experimental data. The third research area is the Design of Simulator Experiments: Efficient designs of simulator experiments will be devised to minimize the computational effort required to determine the sensitivity of a simulator output to each of its inputs. <br/><br/>This research will build a statistical framework for the modeling, design and analysis of experiments that employ computer simulators.

The investigators will develop new modes for training statistics graduate students having interests in engineering applications.

Using a vegetation removal experiment, how co-occurring plants affect the reproduction of Vaccinium will be determined.  Plant traits associated with pollinator attraction and pollinator visitation will be observed, and pollen supplementation treatments will assess pollen limitation.  Fruit set and seed production will be measured to assess pollinator-mediated mechanisms in the stress gradient hypothesis.

The amount of phenotypic diversity and the number of species, however, vary dramatically among different types of organisms and regions of the world. Understanding the evolutionary and ecological processes that cause differences in the number of species among different groups of organisms and geographic regions is a longstanding goal in evolutionary biology. This research first seeks to improve our estimation of the number of species of horned locks, which would help in better understanding how biodiversity evolves and is maintained. This project will then measure geographic variation in camouflage by quantifying how feather coloration on the backs of larks matches the color and composition of the ground among different populations. Species that possess distinct forms of camouflage, or background matching, have provided some of society's most celebrated examples of natural selection; yet we lack an understanding of the evolutionary and ecological dynamics behind such complex, subtle, and continuous patterns of color variation related to camouflage. This research will advance our understanding of how animals adapt to environmental conditions that vary over space and time. The researchers will actively recruit and train undergraduate research assistants from underrepresented demographic groups in science to complete this work. This project will also generate online educational resources and popular science articles to educate the public about natural selection and camouflage in nature.<br/><br/>	This research proposes an integrative study of phenotypic and genetic differentiation within a recent, widespread, and highly polytypic lineage of larks in the bird genus Eremophila.

Using SCPP, the researchers will generate a panel of 60 loci, including the mitochondrial genome, sex-linked markers, and autosomal introns and exons, for phylogeographic analyses and integrative species delimitation alongside phenotypic variation in song, plumage, and morphology. Upon delimiting species and resolving relationships within the genus, the project will use the revised taxonomy and corresponding species tree to quantify the prevalence of geographic variation in cryptic coloration--or the degree of background matching between dorsal plumage and corresponding substrates--among populations and species. Finally, the project will test whether the amount of variation in cryptic coloration is correlated with abiotic niche breadth among species in Eremophila, which would suggest that evolvability of cryptic coloration plays an important role facilitating range expansions into different habitats."

How lineages interact across levels is centrally important, for example, in studying how gut microbes influence mate preference in fruit flies and impact what we treat as units of selection; in how we conceive of when polar and brown bears diverged, given the hybridization between those groups; or in how we think about parental lineages as we manipulate how mitochondrial lineages are transmitted from one human generation to the next. A particularly impressive feature of the project is its interdisciplinary focus. The project includes an interdisciplinary workshop, Species in the Age of Discordance, scheduled for spring 2017. The workshop will directly engage the public through outreach events including a Biohumanities Public Lecture Series event on taxonomy in the 21st century, which will be held at the downtown Salt Lake City Public Library. The PI will also coordinate with the Utah Museum of Fine Arts and the Natural History Museum of Utah on an exhibit featuring the work of artists collaborating with taxonomists, including a public lecture.<br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>The central aims of this proposal are to articulate a ""levels of lineage"" perspective, describe the core commitments of that perspective, and identify how these inform researchers and generate novel research questions. Biological lineages are hierarchically organized, but nesting of those lineages may be ""leaky"" due to a variety of evolved biological mechanisms and processes. Detecting these patterns of discordance provide evidence for a sophisticated multilevel account of evolution, and require biologists to revise core commitments (theoretical, conceptual, methodological, etc.). The levels of lineage perspective identifies the conceptual resources biologists draw on in these projects. It will extend and consolidate recent work in microbiology, systematics, phylogenetics, and evolutionary and population genetics, among other fields. This project aligns with recent work in demanding a diachronic approach by treating the core apparatus of biology as products of evolution. For example, rather than treating the biological hierarchy as a background assumption, researchers are instead prompted to ask, why this hierarchy, or even one at all? Answering these questions provides further resources and research questions."

Differences in floral traits are well known to reduce reproduction between species when they attract different pollinators; this study also addresses how such differences may affect success of other reproductive stages, including the survival of hybrids.  The flowering plants (Angiosperms) form the foundation of agriculture as well as many of the Earth's ecosystems. This study will advance our understanding of how differences in floral traits may first arise, and how those differences may reduce or prevent reproduction between distinct species. This project will also provide research experiences for undergraduates, including those from groups underrepresented in STEM fields.<br/><br/>	This work will employ Quantitative Trait Locus (QTL) Mapping to identify genomic regions associated with floral trait differences and multiple reproductive barriers between two species by genotyping an existing hybrid population that has already been phenotyped for these traits. These genomic regions will help determine the genetic basis and evolutionary history shaping floral traits and reproductive barriers in this system. In combination with existing gene expression data from relevant floral and reproductive tissues, the study will also identify candidate genes controlling these processes. These are key steps in understanding the mapping between genotype and phenotype, which is of fundamental importance in both basic and applied biology. Ultimately, this work potentially will provide unique insights into the genetics and evolution of floral diversity, and the mechanistic role of this diversity in promoting speciation."

As a result, these communities have increasingly tended to become laboratories for developing methods of governance to best manage, measure, and account for potentially hazardous atmospheric phenomena. Many of these communities, however, have long had to cope with and develop effective decision-making regimes in response to such seasonal weather effects. This project, which trains a graduate student in conducting rigorous, empirically grounded scientific fieldwork, explores the interaction between the practices and knowledge that has been circulated among coastal residents and meteorologists, and the more recent apparatus of ecological governance that has been instituted in such contexts of climatic vulnerability. The project would also enhance scientific understanding by broadly disseminating findings to organizations, officials, and scientists engaged in identifying effective models for assessing and coping with risk associated with catastrophic environmental events.<br/><br/>Dilshanie Perera, under the supervision of Dr. Sharika Thiranagama of Stanford University, will explore how meteorological knowledge is produced and circulated in a context where weather-borne disaster are regularly experienced. To do so, this project focuses on the statistical abstraction of climate through the tangible experience of weather at a human scale. The research takes place in Bangladesh, a low-lying deltaic country that faces seasonal storms, monsoon rains, cyclones, and flooding on a yearly basis. Now heralded as the epicenter of climate change, Bangladesh has become a laboratory for global development initiatives trying to pioneer climate relief efforts. As climate change becomes the primary justification for organizational and state intervention into people's lives and livelihoods along the southwest coast, top-down ways of articulating risk in the idiom of climate tend to obscure the experiences of those who have been living with environmental uncertainty in unstable landscapes for generations. This research strives to analyze what the everyday experience of living with potentially catastrophic weather entails. By asking how a new regime of ecological risk takes discursive, programmatic, and material form in Bangladesh, this study explores how knowledge about weather is produced at various scales, as well as how weather is framed a problem of governance and management. By conducting ethnographic research with Bangladesh state meteorologists, coastal farmers, local government officials, and development practitioners, this project will contribute new ways of analyzing environmental governance and social life amid conditions saturated by the recurrent possibility of disaster."

Adaptive radiations represent extreme instances of morphological evolution in response to discrete ecological shifts, and are thought to have made significant contributions to biodiversityon this planet. This research seeks to identify and characterize the genetic and cellular mechanisms that promote adaptive radiations, and thus to provide novel insights into the origins of biodiversity.  This highly interdisciplinary project provides a rich intellectual landscape to train students in various methods and theories. It also offers an explicit framework to develop pedagogical tools for conveying evolutionary principals to the public. This will be part of on-going efforts to develop a series of animated and interactive evolutionary ""origin stories"" that detail the genetic mechanisms that underlie the development and evolution of notable traits, including turtle shells, bat wings, and limb loss in whales. Here the team proposes a new chapter-- Making faces: How the fish changes its skull.<br/><br/>A focal point of this project is phenotypic plasticity, which refers to the ability of an organism to change its appearance in response to a change in the environment. The ability of an individual to change its phenotype in different environments may increase its fitness in changing and/or fluctuating environments, which suggests that plasticity may be adaptive and therefore subject to selection itself.  It is predicted that species that live in fluctuating environments will maintain a high degree of plasticity. Conversely, species that live in more stable environments are predicted to loose the ability to mount a plastic response, and exhibit fixed phenotypes. Unfortunately, a strict genetic basis for phenotypic plasticity has remained elusive, and thus the evolutionary potential for this trait remains largely unknown. The goal of this research is to characterize the molecular basis for phenotypic plasticity of the teleost jaw.  An emphasis on the jaws has direct ecological consequences, as different jaw shapes will determine where a fish lives and what it feeds on. Mutant and transgenic zebrafish will be used to assess the degree to which key molecules involved in bone formation, including those that underlie the primary cilia and Hedgehog signaling, are necessary to promote phenotypic plasticity in the skull and jaws. The molecular mechanisms that underlie plasticity will then be compared to patterns of genetic evolution in a textbook adaptive radiation, East African cichlid fishes, which exhibit extensive diversity in the shape of their jaws. It is predicted that the genes that underlie plasticity of the feeding apparatus, also underlie evolution of the jaws. This is because genetic variation that leads to plasticity is predicted to become ""fixed"" as populations adapt to new environments over time. In all, research under this award will facilitate a better understand of how the genome and environment interact to promote biodiversity."

Insects make up much of the animal life that has evolved on Earth. Understanding why there are so many different kinds of insects and why they are so successful is fundamental to understanding how the wide diversity of life evolved. Insects are well known for producing many different chemical compounds that are required for their communication. Some chemicals help them to locate mates and food resources, others help them to organize activities within the nest or hive, and many others are used to warn off and defend against predators. This project focuses on this last aspect and is specifically testing the idea that the genes responsible for production of the hot chemical spray of the bombardier beetles are closely related to the genes responsible for producing similar chemicals in the insect's outer shell or exoskeleton. A main strength of the project is that it tackles this question by using multiple complementary approaches and by comparing eight different beetle species that are related to varying degrees. Half of these species have evolved a chemical defense system, the other half have not evolved this ability. Many college students and young scientists will receive scientific training in conjunction with the project. People of all ages are highly captivated by these beetles, particularly school age children. With the bombardier beetle as a model, the project will help develop elementary school level hands-on activities and lesson plans on topics in chemical ecology and biological chemical defense evolution that will reinforce the Next Generation Science.<br/><br/>Ground beetles and their relatives form the largest clade of organisms that use a single homologous gland system to produce no less than 19 distinct classes of chemical compounds for defense. This project will develop a detailed functional and evolutionary understanding of defensive chemistry evolution by focusing on species from the four lineages of quinone producing carabid beetles, including species commonly known as the bombardier beetles, which chemically blast their defensive quinones at extremely hot temperatures (up to 100 °C). Using a multidisciplinary approach, this project will identify genes involved in quinone production, elucidate chemical biosynthetic pathways, and describe the genetic architecture of quinone evolution. From gland-specific transcripts, candidate genes related to the production of defensive secretions will be identified and gene function will be validated experimentally by blocking gene transcription and looking at phenotypic changes in the compounds produced. The researchers will test the hypothesis that the genes up-regulated in secretory cells during quinone synthesis are closely related to those involved in quinone production in arthropod cuticle. Thus the project will empirically address the well-known, but untested, scenario of how the bombardier beetle evolved its explosive defense abilities. Ultimately, this project will explore how genetics and chemistry can interact over time and will reveal insights into the fundamental process of evolution."

This is largely due to the fact that pricing approaches are highly visible to both customers and competitors, and thus have an immediate and dramatic impact on the bottom line. The online market for retail goods has grown enormously over the past decade. The development of a sophisticated personalized product and price recommendation system can provide the necessary competitive edge for any Internet retailer, making the difference on the order of billions in profits. The challenge of the new retailing paradigm is to design models for bundling and personalized pricing that are able to extract value from the new streams of customer data that an e-tailer has access to. The goal of this research will be the development of a personalized bundling and pricing model that recommends a bundle of related products to a consumer, but at an incentivized price (lower than the sum of the prices of the individual items) during their online session.  <br/><br/>The innovation in this model will consist of balancing several key factors in terms of bundle and pricing offerings simultaneously, while developing a new approach to personalized demand estimation. The focal points of the work consist of four considerations: (i) developing meaningful personalization models (in terms of bundling of products but also in terms of pricing these products), (ii) developing inventory balancing methods that will balance the tradeoff between losing money due to future markdowns and at the same time facing potentially future inventory stock-outs, (iii) developing interesting structural results and insights on how personalization can tradeoff with bundling in terms of the pricing strategies. Finally, and very importantly, (iv) developing efficient solution approaches (theoretically but also computationally, the latter using actual industry data) that could impact practice. The goal will be to combine these distinct goals in the modeling: personalization, inventory balancing, pricing insights and efficiency/practicality. This research will design innovative models, analyzing them first from a theoretical as well as an applied standpoint but also in exploring the relationships between them and testing them first with real data. Furthermore, this research will build an integrated framework, models and solution techniques from machine learning, integer optimization, stochastic and robust optimization to key personalized bundle pricing problems that are accessible to all, in order to help academics and practitioners in the area of pricing."

Despite its significance as a treasure trove of biodiversity, Vanuatu's plants and fungi remain poorly documented, leaving a significant gap in our knowledge of regional biodiversity compared with neighboring island countries, all of which have active or completed flora surveys. The few existing plant surveys in Vanuatu have focused primarily on the northern end of the archipelago. In the southern part of the country, little reliable botanical data exist, and there is great potential for new scientific discoveries.  This project focuses on Tafea Province, the five southernmost islands of Vanuatu. In March, 2015, Tafea Province was the site of a catastrophic category-5 super-cyclone.  Just prior to that, eight forest transects were established to characterize vegetation growth and change over time. These study sites were severely impacted by the storm, and monitoring efforts will provide an important opportunity to understand how Pacific-Island forests recover from this type of event. Along with its rich biological diversity, Vanuatu is also the most linguistically rich country in the world, with 112 languages for a total population of only 253,000; nine of these languages are found only in Tafea Province. As globalization and economic development are proceeding in Vanuatu, local languages are being replaced by English, French, and Bislama (a local Creole), and thus there is a critical need to document local languages and the botanical knowledge that is encapsulated therein. Undergraduate students will be trained in the analysis of linguistic data, and graduate students will participate in all aspects of the research and receive valuable training in tropical botany and mycology.<br/><br/>The researchers will complete the first comprehensive survey of angiosperms, gymnosperms, ferns, lycophytes, bryophytes, endophytic and macro-fungi, and lichens ever undertaken in Tafea Province. Surveys will be conducted using two approaches: 1) establishment of permanent monitoring transects and plots, which will allow for both vegetation analysis and dense floristic and fungal sampling, and provide an opportunity for long-term monitoring in the face of global climate change, and 2) a general collecting approach will be used across larger areas. From these data, an annotated checklist (both hard copy and online) will be assembled using the database of newly collected and historical specimens. The checklist will allow for tests of phytogeographic relationships among Vanuatu and its closest neighbors (New Caledonia and Fiji), allowing the researchers to address questions relating to levels of endemism, species distributions, and evolution of the regional flora. Because most land in Vanuatu is held under customary ownership, and local people are the stewards of their environments, the loss of biocultural knowledge is a serious threat to their ability to manage biodiversity resources sustainably. To support local environmental education efforts, the project will combine the expertise of the team's linguists and botanists to work with indigenous speakers of eight Tafean languages to document names of plants and fungi, providing a tangible linkage between biodiversity, traditional culture, and conservation. Project linguists will produce printed and digital dictionaries of indigenous plant and fungal names and will use web-based videography and 'story maps', which spatially link names and traditional uses of organisms onto the landscape, helping viewers visualize the connections between biodiversity, knowledge, and place, providing a complement to the botanical databases."

The goal of this research is to study when and how will covariate information help in terms of  the community detection accuracy.  (2) To develop a new dynamic stochastic block model framework with applications in change point detection. The stochastic block model along with its variants are usually defined for a static network. The goal here is to define a dynamic version of the stochastic block model, with a clear interpretation of how the network evolves over time. A general dynamic spectral clustering method will be proposed and its theoretical properties established. The important problem of change point detection of the dynamic network will be studied in details.  (3) To introduce a conditional dependency measure with applications in undirected graphical models. It is of fundamental interest to ascertain variables or factors underlining the network dependency structure. The goal is to introduce a flexible conditional dependency measure, which can capture a wide range of different dependency structures.

Studying living microbialites (carbonate rocks built by microbes, ancient counterparts of coral reefs) in Fayetteville Green Lake, NY, will help solve this riddle. This interdisciplinary study will reveal how the internal structure of these living rocks is formed by microbes and how it is altered by the action of microscopic unicellular predators (so-called protists). Understanding the role of protists in living examples will help to decipher microbialites in the rock record, ultimately improving understanding of the evolution of life on early Earth. The petroleum industry seeks to improve understanding of microbialites' microstructure. The discovery of large subsalt reservoirs off the coast of Brazil, Congo, Eritrea and in the US Gulf of Mexico challenged oil companies to understand the record of very deep (~1-2 km thick) fossil microbialites present underneath an equally thick salt layer. This project will increase the understanding of fabric porosity, and reservoir rocks, critical factors in decision-making during oil exploration. The major outreach activity will be a Science through Art traveling exhibition related to microbialite ecosystems and predation on early Earth, with a tentative title of ""Decimation of Slime World"" (in other words, predation of microbialites). This theme will generate wide interest, and will offer explanations about the research findings in ways that would otherwise escape the art-loving public sector.<br/><br/>The oldest fossil microbialites are the most visible manifestations of microbial life on early Earth. Comprehension of structural differences between microbialite types (e.g., clotted thrombolites, laminated stromatolites) is hampered by incomplete knowledge of their microbiology and early diagenesis. Prokaryotic diversity in extant marine microbialites is well established, however, until recently heterotrophic protists inhabiting these structures and their impact on mesofabric were unknown. A comparative study of non-marine microbialites is lacking. Fayetteville Green Lake NY (FGL), a Proterozoic ocean analog, supports extant microbialites in a non-marine setting. Investigations will assess the role of eukaryotes, notably protists, in microbialite fabric modification and in the possible transition from laminated to clotted mesofabrics during early diagenesis. Four hypotheses will be addressed using FGL materials with these specific aims: 1. Assess biodiversity and activities in microbialites and non-microbialite habitats via sequencing, Fluorescently Labeled Embedded Core method, and various microscopy methods. 2. Determine biogeochemistry using microelectrodes and major in situ microbial activities to link microbiota, element distribution, and mesofabric. 3. Obtain microbialite mesofabric information using microCT scanning. 4. Combine SEM-EDS and Synchrotron-based microXRF to analyze mesofabric features, especially clots, for presence of pyrite and biogenic metals. 5. Determine impact of foraminifera on microbialite mesofabric using seeding experiment. 6. Perform ?forced diagenesis? by incubating microbialite samples under elevated pressure/temperature, inspecting changes in mesofabric using SEM, µCT and µXRF scanning. 7.

In addition, this research will provide information on how best to cost-effectively unlock the genomic resources of museum specimen collections.  Genome-wide data will produce a deeper understanding of the biogeographic history and genetic divergence of these two competing and hybridizing owl species and will help elucidate the genetic implications of modern species range shifts.

Researchers will employ sequence-capture methodology to obtain DNA sequences of markers distributed across the genome for 21 species within the genus Strix. These data will be used to construct a multilocus phylogeny to address questions concerning the following: 1) the phylogenetic relationship of the Spotted and Barred Owl, 2) the evolutionary and biogeographic history of currently hybridizing Strix species, and 3) which of two different sequence capture methods (ultra conserved elements and restriction enzyme digest markers) captures the most informative data from degraded DNA isolated from museum specimens. Utilizing the assembled reference Spotted Owl genome, this research will identify the precise genomic locations of the regions captured and examined in their analyses, and determine whether the instances of interspecific hybridization in other Strix species occur between recently diverged taxa or whether the hybridizing taxa diverged elsewhere geographically and have newly contacted."

This increase in the amount of data helps resolve relationships and settle taxonomic issues, particularly in understudied groups like arachnids. This research will attempt to address unresolved systematic and taxonomic issues through a phylogenomic approach using ultraconserved elements. The inclusion of these key taxa whose placement is uncertain coupled with phylogenomics will lead to a stable taxonomy. Additionally, the general biological characteristics of these harvestmen (low dispersal ability and restricted distributions) make them ideal candidates for hypothesis-based biogeographic analyses. The disjunct worldwide distribution and recently estimated divergence times suggest that these lineages are ancient, likely predating the breakup of Pangea."

Even less well understood are the interactions of between uplift, erosional processes, and climate that shape the mountain landscape. This project uses state-of-the art to examine the interaction of tectonics, erosion, and climate in the Peruvian Andes to test new and controversial ideas concerning the uplift of the Andes. The project advances desired societal outcomes through: (1) full participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM through support of an female researchers and students plus outreach programs to high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities; (2) increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with STEM through participation of outreach programs that provide research experiences for high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities ; (3) development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through undergraduate and graduate student training and support of several early career researchers; and (4) increased partnerships through international collaboration. The Division of Earth Sciences Tectonics and Geomorphology & Land Use Dynamics Programs and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering supported this project.<br/><br/>Earth's surface topography responds directly to mantle processes and plate tectonics, controls surface drainage and sediment transport patterns, and influences atmospheric circulation and climate. As the type example of ocean-continent subduction-generated high topography, the Central Andes are critical to evaluating geodynamic models of orogenesis. Although previous studies of the structural history, past elevations, and incision record have provided important insights on surface uplift, these studies also suggest a disparate range of uplift histories and associated tectonic drivers. Current geodynamic models for Andean orogenesis include: (1) continuous late Cenozoic crustal thickening and shortening, resulting in gradual surface uplift and canyon incision; (2) late Cenozoic delamination of South American lithosphere, resulting in rapid surface uplift and a late Miocene pulse of incision; and (3) early Cenozoic contraction-driven crustal thickening, resulting in near modern elevations in the west by late Eocene and propagating deformation eastward through the Cenozoic. To distinguish between models, this project uses: (1) stable isotope analyses of volcanic glasses and soil carbonates to provide quantitative estimates of paleoelevations over time, coupled with geochronology to constrain timing; (2) isotope-enabled general circulation modeling to determine how changing elevations affected climate and to quantitatively interpret stable isotope data, constrained by modern elevation-isotope and climate-isotope relationships; (3) data-validated fluvial erosion modeling to predict the erosional response to different models; and (4) fluvial and lacustrine sedimentology and sediment provenance to identify changes in drainage system extent and basin development. By synthesizing these data, the research team will quantify surface topography and erosion during orogenic evolution and distinguish between proposed tectonic and climatic controls."

Despite the computational challenges of large datasets, new methods allow genetic and non-genetic data to be analyzed together. These methods offer great potential for genome-wide sampling of variation at different evolutionary scales and an opportunity to understand taxonomic groups with complex evolutionary histories. The 16 currently recognized species of hake, a commercially valuable group of fishes, are often difficult to identify because they are very similar morphologically and there is a high level of within-species variation. This confusion has increased in recent years because there has been continuous splitting and lumping of species based on limited sampling, and limited data on morphological and genetic variability. Some hake species are of conservation concern, with at least one population of the North Pacific Hake being listed under the Endangered Species Act. The poor understanding of the taxonomy of these fishes has led to inaccuracies in fisheries data, making management and conservation difficult. This research seeks to shed new light on the taxonomy of hakes by applying the new approaches of using both genetic and anatomical information together. <br/><br/>The possibility of genome-wide biases, such as rate heterogeneity, underscores the need for corroboration from independent data such as morphology. In contrast, morphological data contains a mixture of informative and misleading traits that are able to delimit some taxa but unable to retrieve others. This study will empirically test the applicability of new integrative methods that combine genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) and morphological data in a Bayesian framework for delimiting hake species. A two-step approach to species delimitation will be used: a species 'discovery' step (without a priori species hypotheses) to assign individuals to putative groups, followed by a 'validation' step, which tests the robustness of the groups. This study will result in a better understanding of the evolution and taxonomy of a group of commercially valuable fishes, and these results can be directly applied to fisheries management."

These pathways are characterized by a chain of remodeling events during which an almost flat patch of plasma membrane is transformed into a cargo-carrying closed vesicle. The most commonly used pathway is called clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) which is important for the exchange of lipids and proteins between the plasma membrane and organelles. As such, CME is critical for maintaining the organization of the plasma membrane and regulating various cellular processes. Recent research on CME suggests that cells sense the mechanical environment by adapting the protein machinery to ensure successful CME. How cells sense and adapt to the mechanical environment to maintain cellular transport is not well understood. The goal of this project is to gain mechanistic insights into this dynamic adaptation in cells via combined theoretical and experimental approaches. Since cells experience varied mechanical environments in different diseased states, this work can provide fundamental insights into cellular transport in diseased cells that can help facilitate the design of improved nanoparticle-based drugs.<br/><br/>This work will offer a physical explanation for the observed ""mechanosensitivity"" and tension-based adaptation in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To achieve this objective, continuum mechanics and Monte Carlo simulations of membrane-protein interactions will be complimented with high-resolution live cell and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to test the competing explanations for assembly of membrane-associated proteins and tension-induced adaptation in CME. This study will address two major debates in the endocytosis literature. First, it will identify the energetically optimal mechanism by which clathrin drives membrane curvature. Second, it will identify the mechanism by which membrane senses tension and recruits actin filaments for driving vesicle growth. The numerical and experimental findings will quantify the extent to which the key membrane-remodeling proteins can counter tension and drive vesicle growth. Overall, these findings would reveal the general principles by which tension regulates the assembly of membrane-remodeling proteins."

These insects interact with the plants that they visit in different ways. Some are pollinators and beneficial to the plant, while others feed on seeds and flowers. Still other insects are visitors that have little impact on the survival and reproductive success of the plant. A very common group of visitors to palm flowers belong to a family of beetles known as weevils. Weevils are incredibly diverse, with around 60,000 species already described and many more still unknown to science. This project will test ideas about how different kinds of insect-plant interactions, beneficial, harmful or otherwise, may affect the evolution of these herbivore insects. A wealth of data will be generated on the diversity and natural history of weevils associated with the Queen palm genus, Syagrus, which includes the several palms widely used for landscaping in tropical and subtropical areas. Results from the research will be disseminated in technical articles, and also in formats broadly accessible to the general public.

Following a comprehensive survey of weevils associated with nearly 70% of the species of Syagrus, this study will use target enrichment and high-throughput DNA sequencing methods to obtain dozens of molecular markers across ~300 weevil species and reliably estimate the phylogeny of the group. The resulting phylogeny will be used to infer when this group diversified and the influence of insect-host interactions on diversification. By combining information on weevil and plant phylogenetic histories, and mode of interaction between each species of weevil and its host plant, this study aims to address how palm weevils are related to each other, whether antagonistic weevils are more specialized than mutualistic one, and whether the phylogeny of mutualistic weevils matches the phylogeny of their hosts more closely than the phylogeny of antagonistic weevils."

Males of this group exhibit complex color patterns on abdominal fans and data suggest that these colored patches are used by females to make mating decisions. Peacock spiders, and jumping spiders in general, have some of the most unique visual systems described. However,  a long-standing question that has yet to be answered for these spiders, as well as many other animals, is how do females evaluate color.  The overall goal of the project will be to test the hypotheses that differences in visual system features between species are related to the diversity of colors and courtship displays seen across this group. An in-depth look at the visual properties of these animals will enhance our interpretation of behavioral and ecological data already collected in this system, inform our understanding about sensory system limitations as well as provide the necessary groundwork for future research on the sensory ecology of this charismatic spider group as well as other animals. All of the results and findings will be widely available to a variety of audiences through publication in peer-reviewed journals, participation in professional conferences, and online databases. In addition, the researchers have a strong commitment to outreach and education among students of all ages.<br/><br/>Salticids have one of the most unique visual systems in the animal kingdom, and are easily distinguished from their relatives by their distinctive eye arrangement. In particular, their anterior median eyes (AME) are enlarged, and contain tiered retinae. The leading hypothesis about the function of tiered retinae is that each layer expresses a different photoreceptor with distinct absorption spectra, however, this has only been tested for a single species. This means that previous research on salticid visual displays has only been able to make assumptions about what females are able to perceive when evaluating potential mates. Salticids of the Maratus genus are exceptionally sexually dimorphic, not only in their appearance, but also, male behavior wildly deviates from that of females in a signaling context. Thus, the proposed research is designed test if color vision exists for Maratus, based on the presence of different opsin genes, and/or optical and retinal characteristics. Furthermore, we will investigate whether variation in these properties has driven signal evolution and/or species diversity. Specifically, we will identify Maratus opsin genes and any pre-retinal filtering in the eye, as well as measure peak sensitivities and relative abundance of photoreceptors in the retina. These objectives will be accomplished through the use of bioinformatics and microspectrophotometry (MSP) methods. We expect that a successful evaluation of visual system evolution will present a major breakthrough for enabling future work on sensory evolution in jumping spiders, an exceptional yet understudied micro-fauna, as well as other animal groups."

The birds of the Solomon Islands have long served as a natural laboratory for the development of community assembly theory. The results of this research will form the basis of understanding in more complex natural systems. By understanding community assembly history, it becomes possible to search for the effects of that history on attributes of contemporary systems. For example, if the order of species arrival into a community influences the functional roles of species in a community, it may be possible to use community assembly history to make predictions about the ecology of contemporary systems. Such a connection would suggest that other attributes of communities, such as stability or resistance to extinction, might be influenced by assembly history. Additionally, the research will form the basis of in-country training for local communities to develop skills necessary to survey biodiversity, build an appreciation for the global significance of the Archipelago's diversity, will contribute to a growing body of open access educational materials tailored to the Solomon Islands, and will train a student in the New York City area in statistical and morphological methods.<br/><br/>In order to reconstruct the assembly history of mixed-species foraging flocks in the Solomon Archipelago, this research will use next generation sequencing of ultraconserved elements from fresh tissues and ancient DNA. Historical biogeography and demography will be used to reveal the sequence of colonization, ancestral population sizes, and gene flow between populations for six lineages of birds that form the nucleus of mixed-species flocks in the Solomon Islands. These data will be related to morphological and ecological data to test for the presence of a signal of island assembly history on contemporary morphology and ecology. While assembly history may appear stochastic at ecological timescales, it assumes a degree of predictability at evolutionary scales. This study will test whether these predictable larger scale patterns influence the ecology of communities. Ultimately, by reconstructing the processes that guide community assembly, it may not only be possible to begin to characterize the history of biotas, but potentially to make predictive statements about ecology based on historical reconstructions."

Large portions of these areas are experiencing a replacement of plants that are mostly grasses with increased numbers of trees and shrubs. This change generally increases the amount of carbon found in both plants and soils, and impacts how other elements that are important for plant growth, such as nitrogen and phosphorus, are used; carbon accumulation may also impact climate.  Nitrogen and phosphorus are nutrients that often limit the rates at which plants grow, and the supply of one or the other can affect other elements. Despite the importance of carbon, nitrogen and phosphorus in plants and soils, very few studies have been conducted that consider all three elements together in dry landscapes, where the numbers of trees and shrubs are increasing. This project will measure patterns of storage of carbon, nitrogen, and phosphorus within the soils in areas where trees and shrubs have largely replaced grasses. The results will provide knowledge on why trees and shrubs are replacing grasses and what these changes mean for those environments. The information gained by this research will be used to improve mathematical models that describe the interactions of climate and nutrient cycles that in turn can inform the conservation and management of these dry lands. Educational materials about the research will be prepared for the general public in cooperation with the Texas A&M AgriLife Extension program.<br/><br/>Modification of soil nutrient pool sizes following woody proliferation has long been of interest to grassland, savanna, and desert ecologists. However, most previous studies examining nutrient dynamics following woody encroachment have been confined to small spatial scales, limited to the uppermost portions of the soil profile, and focused primarily on C and/or N.  This research will quantify soil organic C, total N, and total P throughout the entire soil profile in order to make the first assessment of landscape-scale C:N:P soil stoichiometry following woody plant encroachment into grassland. Specific objectives are: (1) Examine whether vegetation cover change alters the 3-dimensional spatial patterns of soil C, N, and P storage at the landscape scale; and (2) Test whether soil P scales isometrically with respect to C and N, and whether these isometric patterns change with soil depth in N-fixer encroached systems. Nutrient stores will be quantified in spatially-specific soil cores taken to a depth of 1.2 meters in a subtropical savanna landscape where N-fixing woody plants have encroached into grasslands during the past century.  Results will offer new perceptions on the effects of woody encroachment on interactions between C, N, and P cycles in arid and semi-arid ecosystems across the globe, and enhance our ability to represent these interactions in linked biogeochemistry-climate models."

As a major source and sink for carbon, urban areas are a frontier in understanding changing environments and the carbon cycle.  The investigator will study the extent to which city trees function as urban air filters, capturing carbon particles from the atmosphere and then depositing them into soils for long-term storage.  Because of carbon?s powerful influence on atmospheric radiative mechanisms, understanding its removal and input into the soil is key to developing and implementing short-term environmental mitigation strategies.  In addition, understanding the factors that contribute to carbon removal in urban areas could help improve air quality for urban residents.  The research will be conducted at the edge of the Dallas-Fort Worth metropolitan area and will quantify the filtration of carbon particulates.  The project will open new pathways into science, technology engineering, and mathematics (STEM) for geography and education majors, and it provides research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students.  Project results will have socioeconomic implications by providing opportunities to impact urban architecture and configuration while understanding the complex urban forms that drive biogeochemical patterns and processes.<br/><br/>The investigator will quantify rates, pathways, and determinants of carbon deposition at fine spatial scales in a rapidly growing city that is representative of many urban areas in semi-arid regions of the world.  The investigator will explore answers to three core questions:  (1) What is the spatial variability in the deposition rates of black carbon on urban tree canopies?  (2) What is the role of throughfall and litterfall in the flux of carbon to the soil?  (3) What are the urban form components that control spatial patterns of black carbon deposition?  High-resolution light detection and ranging (LiDAR) data, geospatial data, and field-measured vegetation characteristics will be integrated to determine the most important factors contributing to spatial variability in the filtering of carbon particulates.  A statistical model will be developed to provide estimates of carbon removal by trees at the city scale.  The LiDAR-based scaling approach is potentially transformative, because it has broad applicability to a range of scientific questions across diverse ecosystems."

This study examines the genomics of their cells to learn how a group of genes is recruited to form a new specialized cell type.  Distinct types of tissues and cells are differentiated by which genes are expressed.  Cells produce their varied functions by turning the genes necessary for these roles on, while keeping other genes off.  Errors in the expression of genes is one cause of developmental disorders and other diseases, yet the mechanisms of expression control are still not well understood. Observing the patterns of the recruitment process will illustrate how a new cell type evolves, how gene expression is controlled in different types of cells and tissue, and why expression control breaks down. This research will expand the training of a graduate student, who also leads public outreach activities at his university and provides research experiences for high school students and undergraduates. <br/><br/>To study the gene recruitment process, the evolutionary history of genes expressed in the novel sensory organs of Drosophila prolongata will be inferred.  The mRNA from forelegs of this and several closely related species will be sequenced.  The gene sequences present in the mRNA reflect which genes are expressed.  These will be filtered based on similarity to sequences of known sensory genes; those present only in D. prolongata samples represent genes that have acquired new tissue specificity.  These genes will be compared to related genes in other fly species, including the well-studied D. melanogaster, to determine what characteristics make genes more malleable to expression shifts.  The evolutionary patterns reflect naturally occurring variation and suggest mechanisms of creating expression control, factors relevant to gene regulation in other organisms."

Mitochondria produce much of the energy used by cells, and this production depends upon precise interactions of multiple genes. Currently, interactions among mitochondrial genes have not been demonstrated, mainly because these genes are normally inherited as a single unit from the mother and such uniparental inheritance makes it difficult to study gene interactions. To get around this challenge, the researchers will study baker's yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae), which inherit mitochondrial DNA from both parents. They will first generate unique combinations of mitochondrial genes from a large yeast population to evaluate how these influence energy production. Then they will sequence single mitochondrial genomes to identify the specific genes involved. The project will advance our understanding of the mechanics of mitochondrial protein interactions and how they shape evolution. Additionally, the research will be integrated into a genetics laboratory course and engage 128 undergraduate students in hands-on research.<br/><br/>Respiratory function relies on compatible interactions between nuclear and mitochondrial genes, which leads to mitochondrial-nuclear epistasis and, theoretically, interactions between mitochondrial genes (mt-mt epistasis). Natural variation in mtDNAs contributes to differences in fitness, but because mtDNAs are typically uniparentally inherited and do not recombine, it is difficult to functionally dissect individual vs. epistatic effects of mtDNA polymorphisms. The yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae has bi-parental inheritance and recombination of mtDNAs. The natural distribution of mt-mt epistasis will be assessed by mating strains with identical nuclear genotypes but divergent mtDNAs, and the resulting strains containing mitochondrial recombinants will be functionally screened for evidence of mt-mt epistasis. Individual mitochondrial recombinant genomes will be sequenced and interacting loci mapped by comparing differences in allele pair frequencies between phenotypically distinct groups. This research will determine the role mt-mt epistasis plays in natural populations and provide information on mitochondrial recombination in yeast at the resolution of individual recombinant mtDNA haplotypes."

This project will examine how other factors such as seasonal changes in host status (nutritional or reproductive status, for example) influence the spread of disease. The research focuses on bats, which are known or suspected hosts and reservoirs for a number of diseases. Understanding more about host tolerance to disease will be critical to predicting and preventing new infectious diseases. Results will improve understanding of disease risk and spread, with direct consequences for human health. The researchers will continue to work with scientists in Madagascar, contributing to human and wildlife health and conservation in that country. The award will advance the education and training of a doctoral student, supporting her to develop a new measure of host condition and improved models for disease dynamics. The doctoral student will develop a course in modeling disease dynamics and will continue to engage undergraduate students in the research. <br/><br/>The researchers hypothesize that seasonal fluctuations in adipose tissue underlie a host's strategy of pathogen tolerance versus resistance for a diverse suite of viral, bacterial, and protozoan infections. Adipose tissues may mediate pathogen-induced intracellular damage and promote repair by regulating processes of intracellular autophagy. This regulation would promote host tolerance to infection. During resource-scarce winters, reductions in adiposity could lead to declining function in autophagic processes, allowing for accumulation of intracellular pathogen-induced damage that necessitates immune resistance. The researchers will test these hypotheses using serum samples collected during an 18-month field study of pathogen dynamics in three endemic fruit bats in Madagascar. They will conduct enzyme-immunoassays for leptin, a neuroendocrine signaling hormone secreted by adipose tissue, in serum samples of each individual bat in the dataset to quantify adiposity. Data on adiposity will be used to parameterize a new, within-host model exploring adipose tissue contributions to pathogen damage control. Although seasonal contact patterns often capture epidemic dynamics in human infections, they are insufficient to explain pathogen persistence, and the observed seasonality of disease transmission, in a number of important wildlife hosts, including bats."

This project will use a well-supported evolutionary framework of freshwater crayfish to understand the role of gene regulation in producing iconic cave morphologies. This research will promote training of undergraduate and high school students in field, laboratory, and computational work. Data and analysis pipelines will be made available to the public and will contribute to invertebrate genomics research efforts. Ultimately, this research will advance our knowledge of how organisms adapt to novel habitats and contribute to the growing body of research in vision genomics.<br/><br/>While the genetics of vision loss has been studied in single species systems such as the Mexican blind cave fish (Astyanax mexicanus), comparative studies across multiple species aimed at revealing statistically significant and biologically meaningful correlations have been lacking. The multiple transitions to cave habitats by freshwater crayfish and the subsequent loss of vision in each case make the group an ideal model to test hypotheses concerning the loss of complex traits in response to a common selective pressure.  These evolutionarily independent replicates provide statistical power as well as the potential to uncover biologically meaningful correlations. Researchers will use comparative transcriptomics to develop a set of candidate genes related to vision loss and cave adaptation in this system. Gene expression levels will be measured across a set of these genes from multiple individuals of 14 species, both cave and surface, and modeled as an evolving trait on the phylogeny. These data and methods will be used to test if regulatory changes associated with vision loss show a signature of adaptive evolution and if the transcriptome evolves in a predictable way in vision loss events. This project will help to elucidate the role of gene regulation in producing these iconic cave phenotypes, using a unique framework, new technologies, and newly developed evolutionary models."

A typical number theoretic question is to determine the number of whole number solutions of some equation of interest. The answers to such questions can often be encoded in certain mathematical functions known as L-functions. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) regarding L-functions, which predict that any L-function should arise from another kind of mathematical function called an automorphic form. (Number theorists refer to the conjectured relationship between L-functions and automorphic forms as a ""reciprocity law."") Langlands developed an array of powerful representation theoretic methods to study the conjectures. These are methods that exploit the many symmetries of automorphic forms and L-functions to analyze their mathematical properties; these methods have been incorporated into a body of mathematics known as ""the Langlands program."" A more recent approach to the study of automorphic forms and L-functions is the use of p-adic methods. These are methods that involve using divisibility properties with respect to some fixed prime number p to study the Taylor series coefficients of the automorphic forms and L-functions. Recently, the representation theoretic methods and p-adic methods have begun to be unified into a so-called ""p-adic Langlands program."" This project aims to develop new results and methods in the p-adic Langlands program, and to use them to establish new reciprocity laws. <br/><br/>The goal of the research project is to investigate the p-adic aspects of the Langlands program. At the heart of the Langlands program is a conjectured reciprocity law relating automorphic representations to p-adic Galois representations arising from the etale cohomology of algebraic varieties over number fields. The description of this reciprocity is in terms of local laws, that is, reciprocity laws that relate the behavior of the automorphic representation at a prime k to the behavior of the Galois representation at that same prime. These local laws are most subtle when k is taken to be the same prime p that governs the coefficients of the Galois representation; indeed, in this case such a local reciprocity law would constitute a p-adic local Langlands correspondence, and its existence remains conjectural other than in the abelian case, and the case of GL_2(Q_p). With collaborators, the principal investigator aims to investigate this conjectural p-adic local Langlands correspondence in various ways. One part of the work aims to construct moduli stacks of p-adic Galois representations. This will allow for the introduction of new geometric methods into the study of the Galois-theoretic side of the correspondence. Another part of the project will attempt to construct the p-adic local Langlands correspondence in various new contexts. More precisely, previous work of the principal investigator and collaborators used global methods to construct a candidate for the p-adic local Langlands correspondence in some generality; this project aims to establish that the correspondence so constructed is truly local."

The project is a continuation of this classical area, but with a new and fresh look at some of its questions, aimed at developing new methods to solve some well-known open problems.

It is expected that the project will stimulate interest in undergraduates and enhance the research environment for them. <br/><br/>There are four main research areas that are considered. The first is the approximative extensions of conformal maps/Green's functions when conventional conformal extensions do not exist. These can be used in lieu of conformal extensions when less smoothness than analyticity is assumed. The second area concerns new types of polynomial inequalities to settle the best constant problem in Bernstein- and Markov-type inequalities on sets consisting of smooth Jordan curves and arcs, thereby closing a chapter in approximation theory that is more than a century old. The third is the study of Christoffel-Darboux kernels associated with general families of orthogonal polynomials with a possible application to universality results in random matrix theory.  The fourth research area concerns the clarification and resolution of Widom's conjecture on the norm of Chebyshev polynomials. Various polynomial inequalities connect these fields and are expected to play a decisive role in the solutions of the problems under study."

Conservation of this region is especially important given its high level of species endemism; of the 45,000 species of plants native to the tropical Andes, nearly half are found nowhere else in the world. In order to effectively conserve this diversity, it is critical to understand the relationships among species as well as how those species form with respect to time and space. However, such an understanding is lacking for many plant groups in this region. This research aims to improve our understanding of diversity in the genus Phlegmariurus, a widespread group of ancient land plants that are represented by approximately 100 species in the high mountains of the Andes, by identifying how hybridization and genome doubling led to the formation of new species in the group. This research provides funding for the researchers to collect these plants in forests and alpine grasslands in Colombia and Ecuador and to use newly developed DNA sequencing technologies to resolve the evolutionary history of this ancient and ecologically prominent group of plants. Further, this funding will allow the researchers to disseminate their results through national and international meetings and peer-reviewed scientific publications, and to train undergraduate students in cutting-edge molecular biology techniques.<br/><br/>Species relationships and the evolutionary signature of hybridization in tropical American Phlegmariurus will be inferred using an approach that combines DNA sequencing and genome size estimation via flow cytometry. To supplement materials previously collected in Central America, the researchers will collect leaf material from plants in the Andes of Colombia and Ecuador. Dried leaf material will be used both to extract DNA for sequencing and to infer genome size using flow cytometry. Four nuclear-encoded genes, which can be used to infer if a species is of hybrid origin, will be sequenced using the recently developed sequencing approach on the Pacific Biosciences next-generation DNA sequencing platform. By combining this approach with genome size estimation via flow cytometry, the researchers will be able to identify the number of species in the group that originated from inter-species hybridization and subsequent genome doubling (polyploidization). Using computational phylogenetic methods, the researchers will infer the age of lineages in the genus, the evolutionary relationships among species in the group, and the impact of hybridization on rates of species diversification. These results will not only provide insight into the evolutionary relationships among American species of Phlegmariurus, but improve our understanding of the mechanisms underlying the formation and maintenance of species diversity in the Andean conservation hotspot."

This award supports research into the understanding of permutations from a mathematical perspective, in particular permutations involving large numbers of objects. Powerful new techniques at the interface of combinatorics and probability allow the large-scale study of the behavior of ensembles of permutations. Experience with other large combinatorial objects has led mathematicians to expect them to behave in certain predictable ways. As a result, when such permutations arise in nature and do not have the predicted properties, scientists know to seek a hidden explanation. For example, this involves the study of the significance of the order of genes on a chromosome, and the knowledge of the behavior of ensembles of large random permutations may tell geneticists when to look for a pattern.<br/><br/>New discoveries have made it possible to learn much more about the nature of large permutations. In particular, the space of permutations of all sizes can be completed by limit objects that are probability measures on the unit square with uniform marginals. By maximizing a certain entropy integral, one can, in principle, find the limit object that describes nearly all permutations with certain given properties. The proposer and his collaborators will be using both analytic and experimental techniques to exploit this variational principle. One important objective, barely begun, is to plot the landscape of permutations with two fixed pattern densities and determine, for each feasible point, the number and character of the corresponding permutations."

Transcriptomes will be sequenced for three pairs of species, one desert adapted and one temperate adapted, and sequence and expression data will be compared to answer: 1) is there convergence at the amino acid level in desert taxa not seen in the temperate taxa? 2) Are the same genes under selection in some or all of desert taxa? 3) Are there convergent gene expression patterns in the desert taxa not seen in the temperate taxa? The results from this research will provide essential insight into the way organisms adapt to their environment and how genomes evolve."

The first is the motion of Earth's plates relative to one another due to convection of the underlying mantle and the force balance on the plate - we call this ""plate tectonics"". The second mechanism is motion of all of the plates together due to shifting mass anomalies within the Earth and associated rotational imbalance, which can cause reorientation relative to Earth's spin axis. This reorientation motion is referred to as true polar wander, and the rate at it proceeds is dependent on the viscosity of Earth's interior, which is poorly constrained both today and through Earth History. This research targets a particular interval of time around 800 million years ago when it has been proposed that true polar wander was much faster than usual -fast enough that parts of Earth's surface may have moved the distance of the length of football field in around 100 years. The PIs seek to track ancient plate movement in Mongolia and China to test this hypothesis using rocks of this age. They will do so using the magnetic directions preserved in the ancient rocks combined with U/Pb radiogenic isotope dates to precisely determine their age. These data will be used constrain both the rate that plates were moving and the relative movement of different plates in order to determine if the motion is consistent with rapid true polar wander. The results will inform Earth Scientists about the drivers of apparent plate motion at this time and the past position of the continents. The data also have the potential to place constraints on the viscosity of Earth's interior through time.<br/><br/>It has been proposed that large-scale, oscillatory true polar wander (TPW) occurred at ca. 800 Ma, associated with a carbon isotope interval known as the Bitter Springs Stage. Recent advances have led to a temporally quantified framework for the Bitter Springs Stage that enables this TPW hypothesis to be tested in non-carbonate-bearing lithologies, such as successions of extrusive volcanics. This project seeks to test the hypothesis through the development of new paleomagnetic and geochronological data from Mongolia and South China. The goal of the research is to robustly quantify Earth's rotational stability through this critical period of Earth history and allow for rates of TPW to be constrained. The Bitter Springs TPW hypothesis has become a central component of models for how continents aggregate into supercontinents, for fundamental inferences into the viscosity of Earth's mantle and the stabilizing effect of the remanent bulge and excess ellipticity, and for the planetary context of Neoproterozoic environmental change. Furthermore, the hypothesis of rapid TPW at ca. 800 Ma has become a significant component of models for the configuration of the supercontinent Rodinia. This project seeks to constrain the rate of pole movement during this interval through the development of new geochronological and paleomagnetic data from the Zavkhan Volcanics of Mongolia and the Banxi Group of South China in robust stratigraphic context. Importantly, these successions contain: (1) abundant volcanic rocks containing zircon from which high-precision U-Pb chemical abrasion-ion dilution-thermal mass spectrometry (CA-ID-TIMS) dates can be obtained and (2) paleomagnetic confidence tests indicating preservation of primary magnetization. Three years of field work, paleomagnetic analysis, and the development of CA-ID-TIMS U-Pb dates will focus on producing high quality pole paths for the Zavkhan Terrane of Mongolia and the South China craton from ca. 820 to 750 Ma. Such paths can be used to further test whether rapid oscillatory TPW occurred through this interval and, if so, at what rates. Testing and constraining this hypothesis is necessary for progress on the co-evolution of the solid earth and the surface through the time period and determining whether there were time periods in the Precambrian where it can be robustly shown that rates of TPW were higher than those resolved in the Phanerozoic. The broader impacts of the proposed research are four-fold: (1) the training and development of a UC Berkeley graduate student; (2) engagement of undergraduate students in basic research; (3) cultural exchange with Mongolian students in the field and in both of the PIs labs and (4) effective communication of a set of Earth systems history learning goals to K-12 communities through the construction of an educational display module in conjunction with the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH). This educational exhibit will be focused on the geological record of Asia and will include: (1) large rock samples that can be touched; (2) photographs from field expeditions; (3) educational displays about geochronology and paleomagnetism; and (4) a video explaining the geophysical techniques used in this study. Following display in the Earth Science exhibit galleries at HMNH, the exhibit module will travel for display in the Earth and Planetary Science Department at UC Berkeley and then to the Mongolia University for Science and Technology in Ulaanbaatar.

Even less well understood are the interactions of between uplift, erosional processes, and climate that shape the mountain landscape. This project uses state-of-the art to examine the interaction of tectonics, erosion, and climate in the Peruvian Andes to test new and controversial ideas concerning the uplift of the Andes. The project advances desired societal outcomes through: (1) full participation of women and underrepresented minorities in STEM through support of an female researchers and students plus outreach programs to high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities; (2) increased public scientific literacy and public engagement with STEM through participation of outreach programs that provide research experiences for high school and undergraduate students from underrepresented minorities ; (3) development of a diverse, globally competitive STEM workforce through undergraduate and graduate student training and support of several early career researchers; and (4) increased partnerships through international collaboration. The Division of Earth Sciences Tectonics and Geomorphology & Land Use Dynamics Programs and the NSF Office of International Science and Engineering supported this project.<br/><br/>Earth's surface topography responds directly to mantle processes and plate tectonics, controls surface drainage and sediment transport patterns, and influences atmospheric circulation and climate. As the type example of ocean-continent subduction-generated high topography, the Central Andes are critical to evaluating geodynamic models of orogenesis. Although previous studies of the structural history, past elevations, and incision record have provided important insights on surface uplift, these studies also suggest a disparate range of uplift histories and associated tectonic drivers. Current geodynamic models for Andean orogenesis include: (1) continuous late Cenozoic crustal thickening and shortening, resulting in gradual surface uplift and canyon incision; (2) late Cenozoic delamination of South American lithosphere, resulting in rapid surface uplift and a late Miocene pulse of incision; and (3) early Cenozoic contraction-driven crustal thickening, resulting in near modern elevations in the west by late Eocene and propagating deformation eastward through the Cenozoic. To distinguish between models, this project uses: (1) stable isotope analyses of volcanic glasses and soil carbonates to provide quantitative estimates of paleoelevations over time, coupled with geochronology to constrain timing; (2) isotope-enabled general circulation modeling to determine how changing elevations affected climate and to quantitatively interpret stable isotope data, constrained by modern elevation-isotope and climate-isotope relationships; (3) data-validated fluvial erosion modeling to predict the erosional response to different models; and (4) fluvial and lacustrine sedimentology and sediment provenance to identify changes in drainage system extent and basin development. By synthesizing these data, the research team will quantify surface topography and erosion during orogenic evolution and distinguish between proposed tectonic and climatic controls."

These nanomanufactured structural materials are needed for a range of applications such as superhydrophobic surfaces that are self-cleaning and resistant to biofouling, and birefringent reflective surfaces made with multilayered films. While technical progress in such areas is continuing, a major nanofabrication and industrial need is ""process intensification,"" which is fewer processing and energy steps to a final product with desired structural resolution, manufacturing speed, scalability, and economic viability. This award will contribute to future pathways to high-throughput nanomanufacturing of multicomponent inorganic functional coatings and nanofibers derived by using nanotechnology, colloid science, and sol-gel processing. This research involves several engineering and science disciplines related to manufacturing at small dimensions, modeling, nanoscale characterization, fluid dynamics, surface chemistry, and process development. These research areas and disciplines will be integrated into course curriculum, and research opportunities for undergraduate and minority students. This is needed in order to increase STEM majors for our nation's workforce pipeline into engineering and science.<br/><br/>The nanomanufacturing of inorganic derived sols is a complex process that provides a barrier to the realization of many novel structures and materials. In order to overcome this barrier, sol to gel processing needs to be studied and understood, which this award plans to accomplish. Today, many colloidal sols derived from metal alkoxides lack stability, which leads to gelation and intractable materials that eliminates their ability to be processed. The research objectives of this work will be the creation of fundamental knowledge required to bridge the gap between scientific concepts and development of nanomanufacturing processes. This will center upon the design and investigation of innovative approaches needed to harness the processing potential of reactive colloidal sols in order to ""manufacture"" functional coatings and fibers using titania and silica sols. The intellectual significance of this proposed work lies in process control of composition and physical properties at extremely small dimensions, and advancing fundamental nanomanufacturing knowledge in order to create novel form-factors with controlled composition and microstructure. This level of composition and microstructural control will lead to new structure-property-processing relationships. New science and engineering concepts will be developed based on the advanced nanomanufacturing of functional and multicomponent inorganic nanostructures via piezoelectric printing and electrospinning."

In Yellowstone National Park, warming, drying conditions are leading to increased frequency of severe wildfires that kill existing trees and trigger regrowth of the forest. These trends are expected to continue. Many tree species in Yellowstone are well adapted to fire. Yet, early and abundant seedling establishment after fire is critical for forests to recover. Tree seedlings are particularly sensitive to drought, and evidence suggests that sufficiently dry postfire conditions could cause the widespread death of tree-seedlings, with consequences that may last decades. This research will determine how seedlings from two tree species respond to drought conditions expected in the mid-21st century and will identify the mechanisms that influence seedling response to dry conditions. The results of this study will advance understanding of how forests in the western United States will respond to environmental change over the coming decades and provide useful information for western land managers who are grappling with increased wildfires. In addition to providing important scientific knowledge, the study will provide opportunities for undergraduate students to experience research in the field of forest ecology. Researchers will also engage local residents of the Greater Yellowstone area by presenting an exhibit of science art in local shops that features photographs of the research. A handout will accompany the exhibit that presents the study findings to residents, such as how changing forests may influence recreational opportunities.<br/><br/>This research will address the questions: How will 21st century drought alter postfire regeneration of a widespread western conifer? Will future climate conditions favor an alternate dominant tree species of non-forest cover?  A greenhouse experiment will be conducted, where a combination of projected growing season daily temperature and soil-moisture conditions will be simulated to determine how expected drought will influence rates of postfire tree-seedling establishment in different soil types. The experiment will be conducted in a unique facility at the University of Wisconsin-Madison in which environmental conditions can be controlled at sub-daily resolutions, and the work will complement an ongoing field-based experiment in Yellowstone.

Its upper limb consists of warm Atlantic-origin water that flows poleward across the Greenland-Scotland Ridge where it is transformed in the Nordic Seas and high Arctic Ocean. The dense water mass product then returns southward and enters the sub-polar North Atlantic through gaps in the Greenland-Scotland Ridge. The largest of these dense overflows is the Denmark Strait Overflow Water which feeds the bottom-most component of the Deep Western Boundary Current. Previous thinking has maintained that the dominant source of the Denmark Strait Overflow Water is the Atlantic-origin water transported equatorward in the East Greenland Current. In this scheme the warm-to-cold transformation of water takes place in the rim current system of the Nordic Seas. Recent observations, however, indicate that up to half of the Denmark Strait Overflow Water (in particular, the densest component) emanates from the North Icelandic Jet, which advects Arctic Intermediate Water along the north slope of Iceland. The question then arises, what is the source of the North Icelandic Jet and where does the warm-to-cold transformation occur that produces this water? To understand the workings of the AMOC and how it might respond to changes in climate, it is essential to determine all of the dense water sources to its lower limb and understand the atmospheric and oceanic processes that form the water. Herein a wintertime field program will be conducted in the Iceland and Greenland Seas together with a coordinated modeling study to fundamentally advance our knowledge of this newly identified source of dense water and its link to the AMOC. This project will, for the first time, document convection in the northwest Iceland Sea and southeast Greenland Sea in relation to the atmospheric forcing, determine the lateral extent of the transformation and the volume and water mass characteristics of the newly-ventilated water, and characterize the circulation in which the convection occurs. By doing so, the link between the water mass transformation process, the exit pathway of the North Icelandic Jet, and the deep limb of the AMOC will be quantified.  An outreach program will engage secondary school children and the general public, and a graduate student will be trained by the project.<br/><br/><br/>The aim of this project is to fundamentally advance our knowledge of this newly identified source of dense water north of Iceland and its link to the AMOC. The field campaign consists of a six-week wintertime hydrographic cruise to the region that will coincide with the atmospheric field campaign from the United Kingdom. The modeling component will help interpret and tie together the extensive set of international observations that will be obtained. The winter cruise has four components: (1) a broad-scale survey of the northwest Iceland Sea and southeast Greenland Sea where the dense North Icelandic Jet water is believed to emanate from (a region essentially devoid of wintertime observations. This includes an excursion into the center of each gyre; (2) adaptive sampling in conjunction with the aircraft campaign to measure the ocean's response to cold-air outbreaks in targeted areas downstream of the ice-edge, where the mixed-layers should be deepest and densest; (3) focused sampling near the Jan Mayen Fracture Zone to assess the degree to which newly ventilated dense water is fluxed southward from the Greenland Sea to the Iceland Sea; and (4) a detailed survey of the region where the North Icelandic Jet is formed. This project is the U.S. contribution to a broader international program, known as the Iceland-Greenland Seas Project (IGP), to study the air-sea interaction in the northwest Iceland Sea and southeast Greenland Sea and the associated ocean circulation and water mass transformation. The IGP has contributors from the United Kingdom, Iceland, Canada, Norway, and the Netherlands and includes an aircraft campaign that is closely coupled to the oceanographic fieldwork, as well as atmospheric and oceanic modeling."

They will also determine if target genes expressed during flower development have signatures of positive selection.

Results will help predict the consequences of concurrent emerging parasites and will inform strategies to help curb epidemics that threaten wildlife, animal stocks, agricultural crops, and human populations.

The effects of arrival order - or priority effects - are well documented within single hosts but rarely incorporated in classical models to predict and understand multi-parasite epidemics. The goal of this project is to determine (1) how the relative timing of infections alters epidemics in multi-parasite systems and whether multiple infections increase variation in outcome of epidemics, and (2) test whether this variation can be predicted with mechanistic models that incorporate the consequences of co-infection from single-host data. These goals will be accomplished using a combination of experiments and models. The first experiment will examine multi-parasite epidemics with multiple arrival orders of parasites and doubly infected and singly infected populations. This will determine how priority effects alter epidemic patterns at the host population level. A series of single host infection experiments will be conducted to parameterize a predictive epidemic model that accounts for the infection history of hosts and how this history influences interactions among co-infecting parasites and hosts. Comparing model predictions to empirical epidemics will test whether variation in epidemics patterns in natural populations can be predicted from individual host data when accounting for the infection history of hosts. The predictive power of this model will be compared to traditional models that do not include priority effects."

Modern computability theory and theoretical computer science grew out of these efforts, and led in particular to an interest in studying the computational content of mathematics. At the same time, developments in the foundations of mathematics led to the investigation of the relative power of different formal systems for mathematical reasoning. These two areas of inquiry turn out to be closely related, and this project is concerned with questions at their intersection. It aims to further our understanding of how structure affects computability, and how computability interacts with other fundamental notions such as randomness, the power of formal systems, and the interactions between formal systems and the mathematical structures they describe.<br/><br/>In particular, this project lies in two related areas: computable mathematics and reverse mathematics of combinatorial, model theoretic, and related principles; and notions of robust information coding, including their connections with algorithmic randomness. Reverse mathematics and computable mathematics are closely related and complementary approaches to calibrating the strength of theorems and constructions throughout mathematics, and revealing the fundamental structure behind them. The investigation of combinatorial and model-theoretic principles from this point of view has proved to be a particularly rich line of research, and this project will pursue it from several angles, for instance the study of first order consequences of second order principles and notions of computability theoretic reduction that provide a particularly fine-grained analysis of the comparative strength of mathematical statements. Several of the combinatorial principles that play a central role in this area concern the existence of particular kinds of subobjects, which leads to a natural connection with the investigation of notions of robust information coding, which are reducibilities capturing the idea of being able to obtain partial information about an object from partial information about another. This project will further the study of these notions, in particular versions of infinite information reducibility, which are particularly closely connected with the computability theoretic aspects of versions of Ramsey's Theorem, and versions of coarse reducibility, which have already been found to have significant connections with algorithmic randomness."

We now know that the most common way species form is when different populations become geographically separated from each other and begin to genetically diverge. We also know that this process can take millions of years. But at any time, during the process of splitting, populations may come back into contact and form a narrow zone of contact where individuals from one group mate with individuals from the other group (a hybrid zone). While hybridization generally leads to a slowdown in the rate at which new species form because their genomes are no longer separate, several mechanisms have been identified whereby hybridization can actually promote divergence. This project focuses on the evolution of chromosome inversions, rearrangements to the structure of the genome that act as genetic barriers between young species that share some gene exchange in narrow hybrid zones. This information is critical to understanding the natural consequences of geographic divergence, periodic gene exchange, speciation, and the resulting biodiversity that is present on Earth. Education-related public outreach efforts at the Field Museum of Natural History, where the research takes place, will involve Chicago area high school and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>These researchers study a hybrid zone between subspecies of the long-tailed finch (Poephila acuticauda). Subspecies differ in beak color (yellow vs. red) and hybridize across a narrow contact zone in northern Australia. Genetic differences between subspecies are largely restricted to one chromosome. Several large chromosome inversions are on the same chromosome. The researchers will examine the genomes of individual birds from across the hybrid zone to identify the genes encoding a reproductive isolating trait: beak color."

This project will investigate some of the least understood aspects this globally important process: what causes it to start, what kind of crust is produced after subduction starts, and what materials are released from the subducting slab as it initially sinks. The International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 352 drilled 1.22 kilometers of volcanic rocks at water depths of 3.1-4.8 kilometers in the Bonin fore-arc in the western Pacific Ocean to investigate the start of subduction. This research performs a complete geochemical and petrological characterization of drilled fore-arc, seafloor, mafic, volcanic rocks, (i.e., basalts and boninites) recovered during the drilling expedition to better understand how subduction zone volcanism begins and evolves. The rock sequences encountered in the Bonin fore-arc are remarkably similar to those found in many ophiolites (ocean crust and upper mantle rocks found on the continents), so this project will also provide insights into the origin of ophiolites as well. This project supports and expands the extensive international scientific collaborations developed during Expedition 352 to include additional top-flight female scientists as well as undergraduate and graduate researchers.  Results from this project will become part of classroom resources supported by an ongoing NSF-funded education project.  It will also provide funding to researchers at institutions in three EPSCoR states (Iowa, Utah, and Rhode Island) and foster international collaboration with Australian scientists.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to document the nature of the first crust produced after subduction initiation in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc system.

Drill cores from two of the sites primarily recovered fore-arc basalts and two recovered boninites.  This research, in collaboration with that being done by other members of the shipboard scientific party, will comprehensively analyze the recovered volcanic rocks, providing geochemical data on the major and trace element compositions of volcanic glasses. It will also complete analyses of oxygen isotopes, water and CO2 concentrations in the volcanic glasses; measurements of water concentrations in pyroxenes; Fe ratios in glasses; concentrations of fluid-mobile elements and B-Li isotopes in whole rocks and glasses; radiogenic Re-Os isotopes and PGE abundances in whole rocks and glasses; and major element and trace element compositions of whole rocks. Resulting data will be used to constrain melting processes and understand variations in the fluid, solid, and magma fluxes through the nascent mantle wedge from subduction initiation onward as the mode of magma generation changes from decompression melting to flux melting. The data will be used to address four principle scientific questions: (1) are fore arc basalts generated by decompression melting in a unique high temperature, low-pressure environment during rapid sea-floor spreading related to subduction initiation; (2) are the mantle sources of fore arc basalts and boninites unusually depleted and do they exhibit signatures of ancient recycled mantle or continental components; (3) were low- and high-Si boninites from drilling Sites U1439 and U1442 generated in succession from depleted mantle left after generation of fore arc basalts as spreading rates decreased and the involvement of subducted fluids increased; and (4) did magma generation migrate landward with time and to lower pressures. These questions align with the principal objectives of the NSF-funded International Ocean Discovery Program's Initial Science Plan, including testing the validity of the ophiolite model and understanding the initial origins of continental crust. Additionally the work will address questions in the NSF-funded GeoPRISMS science plan that focus on what the physical and chemical conditions are that control subduction zone initiation and the early development of arc systems."

Reference grammars constitute a more comprehensive, highly detailed set of explanations and involve extensive linguistic analysis, so often the initial preliminary attempts at describing a language's patterns result in a short description known as a ""sketch,"" with a later publication of a reference grammar following subsequent scientific research.  In some cases, linguists develop the sketch but never circle back to publish that reference grammar, creating a large gap in the documentation.  This is the case for numerous languages that were described and analyzed in the first half of the twentieth century, including Potawatomi (also called Bodéwadmimwen or Bodwéwadmimwen), a critically endangered Algonquian language. The Native American Languages Act, passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990, enacted into policy the recognition of the unique status and importance of Native American languages. It is estimated that there are less than 10 fluent native speakers of Potawatomi today, all elderly. Considerable effort is being made towards language revitalization, but materials for training advanced speakers are in short supply. This project will fund dissertation research that will produce a reference grammar for Potawatomi. Broader impacts of the project include making the planned documentation will be useful to both linguists and community members, by producing an example-driven, digital presentation version of the grammar for language teachers and students.<br/><br/><br/><br/>In this dissertation project, doctoral student Hunter Lockwood will research and produce the first grammar of Potawatomi since Charles Hockett's 1939 sketch of the language in his own dissertation. Data from Hockett are often cited in theoretical linguistics; this dissertation will add depth and breadth to the contribution the language can make to linguistic science. For example, almost no work has been done on Potawatomi syntax or semantics; this dissertation will fill those gaps in the documentary record. This reflects the continued collaboration between the Forest County Potawatomi Community and the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Previous collaboration between these two institutions, also with funding from the National Science Foundation's Documenting Endangered Languages Program, has resulted in a bilingual dictionary and a corpus of transcribed stories and natural speech.  As a result, the dissertation research will utilize methods relying on modern digital tools for building and analyzing large sets of language data collected in a corpus, integrating data from the corpus and dictionary in the analysis."

These pathways are characterized by a chain of remodeling events during which an almost flat patch of plasma membrane is transformed into a cargo-carrying closed vesicle. The most commonly used pathway is called clathrin-mediated endocytosis (CME) which is important for the exchange of lipids and proteins between the plasma membrane and organelles. As such, CME is critical for maintaining the organization of the plasma membrane and regulating various cellular processes. Recent research on CME suggests that cells sense the mechanical environment by adapting the protein machinery to ensure successful CME. How cells sense and adapt to the mechanical environment to maintain cellular transport is not well understood. The goal of this project is to gain mechanistic insights into this dynamic adaptation in cells via combined theoretical and experimental approaches. Since cells experience varied mechanical environments in different diseased states, this work can provide fundamental insights into cellular transport in diseased cells that can help facilitate the design of improved nanoparticle-based drugs.<br/><br/>This work will offer a physical explanation for the observed ""mechanosensitivity"" and tension-based adaptation in clathrin-mediated endocytosis. To achieve this objective, continuum mechanics and Monte Carlo simulations of membrane-protein interactions will be complimented with high-resolution live cell and super-resolution fluorescence microscopy to test the competing explanations for assembly of membrane-associated proteins and tension-induced adaptation in CME. This study will address two major debates in the endocytosis literature. First, it will identify the energetically optimal mechanism by which clathrin drives membrane curvature. Second, it will identify the mechanism by which membrane senses tension and recruits actin filaments for driving vesicle growth. The numerical and experimental findings will quantify the extent to which the key membrane-remodeling proteins can counter tension and drive vesicle growth. Overall, these findings would reveal the general principles by which tension regulates the assembly of membrane-remodeling proteins."

Globally, ~2.5 billion people reside in drylands, and therefore drylands are socioeconomically important. The effect of non-rainfall precipitation components (e.g., fog and dew) on dryland ecosystems is one of the least studied aspects in hydrology. Quantifying and identifying the various sources of non-rainfall moisture to dryland systems are integral to predict how non-rainfall components will change under future climate change and how dryland ecosystems will respond accordingly. Through the use of emerging technology, comprehensive field observations and process-based modeling, this project will provide a key step toward understanding the origins and effects of non-rainfall inputs in dryland ecosystems. This project will include broad community outreach, and educate students at all levels (K-12, undergraduate and graduate), including those underrepresented in the STEM fields. These outreach and educational activities include education module development for third through ninth grade students, authentic research experiences for high school students, a summer teacher-training program for high school teachers, research abroad experience for undergraduate students, and professional development for graduate students. <br/>	<br/>Despite the importance of non-rainfall precipitation, it remains unclear as to the amount of non-rainfall input that is needed to sustain dryland ecosystems. Furthermore the specific sources of non-rainfall water (e.g., ocean water vs. local groundwater), and the relative contribution of fog and dew, are not known for dryland systems. Quantifying and identifying the various sources of non-rainfall moisture to dryland systems are integral to predict how non-rainfall components will change under future climate change and how dryland ecosystems will respond accordingly. The overarching goal of this proposed research is to evaluate the effects of non-rainfall inputs on dryland ecosystem functions through stable isotope (2H, 17O and 18O) and modeling analyses. The field research will be conducted at a long-standing international station in Namibia (Gobabeb Research and Training Center) due to its unique ecological location, prior research and existing logistics for conducting field research at the proposed site."

Uniform heating of the manufactured part cannot solve this problem because it can cause warping of the 3D-printed structure that affects the mechanical reliability of three-dimensional (3D) printing as a plastic manufacturing technique. This research examines a novel manufacturing process where a thin coating of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is deposited on the plastic filaments used in 3D printing. Microwave exposure of the printed parts causes the CNTs to heat that allows for localized polymer melting at the welds, resulting in markedly improved mechanical strength of the part. If successful, the additive manufacturing technology enabled by this project has the potential to overcome the current disparity between traditionally manufactured polymer parts such as injection molding, extrusion molding and machining as compared to parts printed with additive manufacturing techniques. <br/><br/>Specifically, this work uses a combination of experimentation and computation to measure and model the response of CNT-loaded polymer films in order to directly capture the coating thermal dynamics. This will be done using a combination of alternating current dielectric measurements, infrared imaging, and finite-element modeling (combining radio frequency heating and heat transfer in thin coatings). This will be followed by a scaled-up investigation of the coating, material extrusion, and controlled microwave exposure processes to demonstrate how this concept translates to an additive manufacturing context, with an emphasis on strength improvements (as measured on vertically printed tensile bars) and reliability. The microwave exposure will be carried out using simultaneous infrared imaging and real-time adjustment of forward power to yield consistent, specified heating treatments. The intellectual significance of the work stems from the translation of microscale CNT heating to processing-structure-property relationships for welds in complex, macroscale 3D printed structures.

Because the notion of a set is among the most primitive in mathematics, it was used as the basic fabric with which to build the more complicated objects of mathematics. Since that time, it has been realized that the properties of infinite sets are themselves quite subtle and defy a complete axiomatization. Moreover, these set-theoretic complexities sometimes manifest themselves in more complex mathematical structures, such as those studied in algebra, analysis, and geometry. The aim of this project is to further develop both our understanding of set-theoretic methods and also how they can be applied to problems arising in fields of mathematics such as algebra, analysis, and topology. While the project involves several lines of investigation, a central theme will be to develop a deeper understanding of the structure of the algebra of all piece-wise linear functions from the unit interval to itself using the lens of transfinite ordinal numbers.<br/><br/>The first part of the research project involves attempting to prove the following conjecture of Matthew Brin and Mark Sapir: if G is a group of piece-wise linear homeomorphims of the unit interval, then either G is elementary amenable or else G contains an isomorphic copy of Richard Thompson's group F. It is the PI's thesis that not only is this conjecture true, but that it will be a consequence of a much finer analysis of subgroup structure of PLoI, the group of piece-wise linear homeomophisms of the unit interval. This analysis is expected to have a number of other consequences: that the finitely generated subgroups of F are well quasi-ordered by embeddability; that any finitely presented subgroup of PLoI is either abelian or contains a copy of F; that Peano Arithmetic does not prove that F is amenable. Central to the analysis will be the countable transfinite ordinals. The second part of the research project concerns further developing techniques in pure set theory: methods for studying the combinatorics of the second uncountable cardinal via forcing axioms; the role that Jensen's diamond principle plays in the theory of the sets of hereditary cardinality at most aleph1. The project also supports graduate students working in other fields of logic, including computability theory and model theory."

Wind energy has countless benefits: it is renewable and abundant, does not produce any harmful pollutant or greenhouse gas emissions, and is so technologically advanced that it is often economically competitive with other traditional energy sources. However, concerns are rising about possible undesirable effects of wind turbines in the lower boundary layer, especially on near-surface temperature. The literature is highly divided about what these effects could be. Numerical simulations have shown: warming during day and night; warming at night and cooling during the day; warming or cooling depending on atmospheric stability; cooling; and no significant effects. These contradictory findings highlight the inherent complexity of the feedbacks between wind turbines and atmosphere.<br/><br/>Only one mechanism, however, has been widely accepted (but never tested) to explain how wind turbines affect the lower boundary layer, namely that turbulence generated in wind turbine wakes enhances vertical mixing. Wakes are plume-like volumes downwind of wind turbines that are characterized by lower wind speeds and higher turbulence than the undisturbed upwind flow.  Enhanced vertical mixing would manifest as increased vertical momentum fluxes (thus increased wind shear) and increased turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) near the ground. The few observational campaigns that have measured changes in near-surface properties by wind turbines have been flawed or inconclusive and have not measured directly vertical momentum flux changes.  Therefore, no direct evidence of the enhanced vertical mixing mechanism is available today. In addition, enhanced vertical mixing does not explain all the observed effects.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The research hypothesis put forward in this project is that vertical mixing is generally not enhanced, but, more likely, reduced near the surface downwind of wind turbines.  The vertical wind profile is greatly altered due to the extraction of kinetic energy by wind turbines in the region around the rotor disk of diameter D spanned by the turbine blades, but the resulting wind shear near the ground is generally unaltered or reduced, not enhanced, below the rotor. Near-surface heat, moisture, and momentum fluxes, and eventually temperature, are therefore generally not directly affected by wake turbulence, but rather by a combination of the reduced, not enhanced, wind shear, atmospheric stability, and undisturbed flow properties.<br/><br/>To test this hypothesis, a combined observational and numerical approach will be carried out. The measurement campaign, named VERTEX for VERTical Enhanced MiXing, will be conducted near the University of Delaware Gamesa 2-MW wind turbine in Lewes, using 12-15 surface flux towers, a 60-m meteorological towers, and 2 scanning lidars. VERTEX will quantify changes in momentum and heat fluxes, air temperature, and TKE near the ground due to the wind turbine.  The interactions between the wind turbine and the atmospheric flow will be simulated with at least two state-of-the-art numerical codes that can resolve the details of the turbulent wake down to a few meter resolution. Data from VERTEX will be used to validate the simulations. The sensitivity to a variety of inflow and atmospheric stability conditions will also be assessed.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>This research will provide an understanding if and how wind turbines can alter near-surface properties in any significant way. This understanding is important because it will either enhance wind energy deployment or slow it if such changes are considered too dramatic.  Research findings will be communicated to: 1) the scientific community via participation to conferences and peer-reviewed papers; 2) the general public via targeted outreach efforts, including an exhibit at the annual University of Delaware's Coast Day and press releases; and 3) university students via a newly developed graduate and undergraduate course on ""Energy in the atmosphere""."

Animals often rely on steroid hormones to adapt to the environments they are in.  But in young individuals small differences in the concentration of hormones during development can profoundly alter later survival and behavior. During development a mother's hormone levels impact her developing offspring, and therefore impact more than her own immediate survival but also that of the young she produces. Many studies have tested the idea that steroid hormones provided by mothers to their offspring could help offspring exploit their later adult environment. However, these studies have used animals that take care of their offspring after birth. Can mothers use steroid hormones alone to optimize offspring, or is parenting behavior also necessary? This project will investigate that question by measuring the effects of a steroid hormone on offspring development and survival in an insect species that provides no parental care to its offspring. The results will show whether mothers can use steroid hormones to prime their offspring for future behavioral environments without relying on parental care. Because every mother transmits hormones to her offspring regardless of species, the results of this study will amplify our general understanding of how hormones function across generations. As such, it will likely be especially relevant to conservation of endangered species and environments, and individualized medicine. This broad applicability will also facilitate outreach to local K-12 students and findings will be presented to the scientific community through publications and presentations. <br/><br/>This study will investigate maternal effects and aggressive behavior in an invertebrate (Acheta domesticus, the house cricket) that provides no care to offspring, but which naturally experiences variable social environments. Previous data shows that higher levels of ecdysteroid hormones (ESH) in eggs are associated with increased fitness for hatchlings. Proposed research addresses the question of whether and to what extent parents that have no later contact with their offspring can alter the development and behavioral phenotype of said offspring in response to social environment and through endocrine maternal effects alone. Female house crickets will be raised in four social environments (high and low total density, high female density and high male density), and their egg ESH deposition and total reproductive output will be measured, also. Research proposed here will disentangle the effects of maternal hormone provisioning and parental care on offspring life history by measuring hormone provisioning in a system without parental care. This work will also provide more information about ecological and evolutionary functions of ecdysteroid hormones (ESH), which have until now been studied primarily in the context of embryogenesis and molting and are generally underappreciated as mediators of long-term 'organizational' effects. Finally, this research tests the current behavioral endocrinology framework established using vertebrate study systems by considering hypotheses in the independently evolved insect endocrine system."

This study will provide insight into how genetic differences among organisms arise, the basis for all evolutionary change and the diversity of life. Differences among organisms are driven, in part, by differences in their genes and differences in the rate at which genetic information is used for the building of proteins and other cell structures, the activity of those genes. Genetic differences arise due to errors made when copying DNA, the molecule in which genetic information is stored. If these errors happen during cell divisions that lead to an individual's offspring, the differences will be inherited by all future generations. A parallel educational activity will develop a computer-based application that simulates copying errors in the context of music. When students learn genetics, they often begin with several misconceptions about mutations. However, realistic experiments illustrating properties of mutations are difficult to execute in class settings. Therefore, the project includes development of ""Mutational Music"", an application for mobile devices that uses computer-based music to simulate spontaneous mutations, along with an educational program appropriate for use in introductory genetics laboratories.<br/><br/>Spontaneous mutations are the ultimate source of genetic variation; understanding their characteristics is therefore a fundamental goal of biologists. Existing work has quantified the rate and effects of spontaneous mutations, usually focusing on the molecular spectrum of mutations or on fitness effects. These foci are widely separated, and the processes that link molecular mutations to fitness effects have received less attention. This project is aimed at bridging the gap between fitness and the molecular spectrum of mutations, focusing on mutational changes in the transcriptome and in phenotypic plasticity of key life history traits. The research involves a mutation accumulation experiment in the model crustacean Daphnia pulex, coupled with analyses of gene expression and life history traits made in distinct resource environments. The work will generate estimates of the mutational variance and heritability of expression for each gene, including the ability to identify allele-specificity and splice variant-specificity. In addition, the work will quantify the distribution of effects spontaneous mutations have on life history traits and their plasticity. The components will be joined to investigate the potential that expression mutations contribute to the origin of phenotypic plasticity."

For many years, researchers argued that providing individuals and communities with open access to natural resources would inevitably lead to overuse and ultimately to destruction through deforestation, overfishing, overgrazing, and other environmentally detrimental activities. However, subsequent research by political scientist and Nobel laureate Dr. Elinor Ostrom and her colleagues found that this ""tragedy of the commons"" scenario is not universal. Instead, some small communities do effectively manage local lands without external oversight. This appears to occur most often when communities have enduring, well-developed social norms for maintaining the natural environment and for sanctioning individuals who violate community standards. But these findings raise another question: If some communities can do it, why not all? Why are some communities effective at preserving their natural resources while others are not? The research supported by this award seeks to answer that question. Anthropologist Dr. Sean S. Downey (University of Maryland) will test the theory effective land management rests on more than just having the right social norms; in addition, he suggests, the social norms, the particular characteristics of the local environment, and the ecosystem services the environment provides to local users must work together to produce ecological sustainability.<br/><br/>Few communities in the United States are both free of external oversight and also dependent primarily on the local natural environment for subsistence. Therefore, Dr. Downey and his team will travel to two forest-based villages located in a remote area in southern Belize to test the theory. The communities have a demonstrated history of local ecological knowledge and environmental stewardship but there has historically been little top-down environmental management: an ideal location for understanding how local community norms and natural ecosystem dynamics interact and create a sustainable forestry system. The researchers will collect data through multiple methods: household surveys; farmer land use interviews; and close monitoring of how the communities affect their forests. The monitoring will be accomplished through piecing together high-resolution photographs of the usage areas around each village using a GPS-linked multi-spectral camera mounted on an unmanned aerial vehicle. These photos will subsequently be stitched together into geo-referenced two-dimensional photo-mosaics, ground-truthed through farm plots surveys, and analyzed to understand how these environments provide for the local communities, how they are affected by human farming activity, and also how these forests recover to sustain future generations. The research team will also conduct behavioral economics experiments to assess how cooperation and punishment in the communities relate to natural resource use, and use computational analysis to determine the most important social and natural factors for effective long-term natural resource management. The project also has several integrated educational goals, including training the next generation of American scientists, educators, and policy-makers in the science of complexity; developing coursework and facilitating interdisciplinary collaboration at the University of Maryland; and offering a service learning project for American students in Belize. Ultimately, findings from this research will provide insight into the factors that promote effective local management of natural resources and this could lead to better and more efficient management of public lands at a significant cost savings."

In western Panama, where the species ranges of the tropical shorebirds known as Northern Jacanas and Wattled Jacanas meet, they form a hybrid zone. Jacanas exhibit mating role reversal where females control access to mates by competing for territories encompassing a harem of males, and males provide all parental care. The unusual circumstance of hybridization between species with such a unique mating system offers a window into examining why and how species-specific boundaries to mating fail, from a female perspective. Genetic and experimental evidence suggests that differences in aggressive behavior between the species may explain patterns of hybridization.  Females of the more aggressive species produce the majority of hybrid offspring. The proposed research employs techniques to assess the expression of genes to examine variation in aggressive behavior between the hybridizing species. This research addresses a fundamental question in ecology, evolution, and behavior what is the genetic basis of behavioral differences? This can 1) improve our understanding of the behavioral mechanisms important in species formation, and 2) provide insight into the genetic mechanisms underlying behavioral differences between males and females.  Understanding of science and research will be communicated through workshops with local school aged children and ecotourists at the Panamanian field site.<br/><br/>Between recently diverged species, mating behavior can either impede or promote reproductive isolation. Theoretical and empirical evidence demonstrates this for female mate choice and male competition, but little is known about the relative roles of each. Female aggression has only recently been recognized as an adaptive behavior, and how its underlying mechanisms compare to those of males is not well understood. A key step towards understanding the evolutionary significance of the competitive phenotype in females is determining its underlying genomic mechanisms. The goal of the proposed research is to elucidate the molecular basis of the female competitive phenotype by identifying clusters of candidate genes whose differential expression is responsible for consistent variation in aggressive behavior. This study combines aggression assays with a transcriptomic approach to address this question in role reversed, hybridizing Northern Jacanas (Jacana spinosa)and Wattled Jacanas (J. jacana) in Central America. This project is novel with respect to understanding the mechanisms by which phenotypes change as role reversed species diverge, which could advance our understanding of how organisms respond and adapt to changing environmental selection. By identifying how the genes underlying aggression are differentially expressed between role reversed females and males, the proposed research will expand upon general principles in sexual selection theory that have been developed in well-known male-dominant systems. Furthermore, this project investigates the genetic underpinnings of complex behavioral traits in wild, free-living, non-model organisms, which is vital for understanding the evolution of ecologically relevant phenotypes under natural conditions."

Reinforcement learning is an approach to autonomous decision-making through trial-and-error interaction with an unknown environment, with a focus on learning incrementally from this stream of data. Reinforcement learning has significant industrial potential, particularly for real-time control systems, such as active network management for energy and search-and-rescue robots, and is already used in a wide range of fields, including robotics, psychology, animal learning and neuroscience. To improve the practical application of reinforcement learning, this project proposes a new class of algorithms with the goal to balance computational complexity and the sample efficiency of learning, which often requires significant computation and memory. This space of algorithms that attempt to balance both requirements has been under-explored for reinforcement learning, and provide exciting opportunities to impact industrial applications and the growing area of computational sustainability. An important aspect of this project will be to implement and study these algorithms on a wide-range of simulated environments, and engage a diverse group of students through courses and summer research.<br/><br/>This project develops efficient incremental approximations to summarize gathered samples for improved sample efficiency and an empirical framework to evaluate these algorithms. This new class of accelerated learning techniques formally trade-off computation and accuracy and have many promising extensions and research directions, through a variety of accelerated stochastic gradient descent techniques and incremental matrix approximations. Further, another focus is to develop tools and novel measures for the reinforcement learning community that evaluate this balance between sample efficiency and computational complexity, with the code framework released through an existing open-source platform. This initial systematic exploration of these novel optimization variants will lay the foundation for the long-term goal of improving efficacy of reinforcement learning in industry and for practical autonomous agents."

Females breeding in more competitive environments tend to transfer more testosterone to their offspring prenatally, which permanently makes offspring more aggressive. This maternal effect may help offspring adapt to competitive environments, yet it is still unclear how maternally derived testosterone permanently impacts offspring behavior. Without knowing how it happens, it is difficult to characterize the heritability of this maternal effect and how it fits into larger evolutionary frameworks. This research is among the first to test if molecular mechanisms, such as changes in gene expression and control, mediate the effects of maternal testosterone on offspring aggression using birds, in which this maternal effect is best studied. This research will take a novel approach by exploring differences in aggression-related genes from several brain pathways. The results of this research will help clarify what contributes to long-lasting variation in aggressive behaviors and why differences in animal behaviors exist. The researchers will also train undergraduate students in laboratory methods and bioinformatics. Additionally, this research has lent itself to a citizen science project with songbird breeders throughout the United States to explore factors influencing avian reproduction. <br/><br/>Specifically, the researchers will experimentally determine if an epigenetic mechanism (i.e., DNA methylation) underlies the programming of offspring aggression by maternal hormones in songbirds. Birds are excellent models for maternal effects because their young develop externally in eggs and females allocate substantial amounts of testosterone to their egg yolks. The researchers will inject zebra finch eggs with a control vehicle or testosterone and measure aggressive and competitive behaviors (i.e., growth rate and begging rate) in the resulting offspring. In a subset of these offspring, the researchers will test for evidence of epigenetic programming. Aggressive behaviors are initiated across many interacting genes (i.e., steroid receptors, histamine, dopamine, somatostatin, arginine vasotocin, etc.). Thus, the researchers will use RNA-seq and methyl-seq analyses to explore genome-wide differences in mRNA expression and site-specific methylation patterns of aggression-related genes in two socially-relevant brain regions, the telencephalon and diencephalon. This research will greatly expand our knowledge of how different gene networks interact across brain regions to express aggression and will provide one of the first avian DNA methylomes.

Based on these data, undocumented species will be identified, characterized and formally described. Two major hypotheses will be tested: whether arid-adapted species of S.W.

Public outreach efforts will include development of short video documentaries and English- and Portuguese-language guides to Angola's amphibians and reptiles.<br/><br/>Surveys of the Angolan herpetofauna will be informed by current knowledge gained from the less than 8,000 specimens that currently exist in museums worldwide. A total of six expeditions throughout Angola will be undertaken over a period of three years, with each focusing on a region identified as poorly sampled based on the provenance of extant museum specimens or as key sampling areas for addressing taxonomic problems. Specimens obtained in survey efforts will be subjected to collection and analysis of ecological, genetic, and morphological data. Molecular systematic analyses of the genetic data will identify cryptic species and targeted high-throughput sequencing will be used to test biogeographic hypotheses. Morphological data collection will include external morphological examination as well as high-resolution CT scanning to identify diagnostic internal anatomical features of species under study. Ecological niche modeling of species' ranges will be used to explore patterns of faunal turnover and identify conservation priorities.

Carbon storage in wetland soils can be for the long-term and influences whether wetlands will persist during sea level rise by increasing a change in sediment elevation. Climate change and local freshwater management are increasing the movement of saltwater into coastal freshwater wetlands, altering the conditions of the wetlands and causing shifts in the types of vegetation growing there. In many tropical and subtropical coastal wetlands, mangroves are replacing grass-dominated marshes, with uncertain effects on the capability of soils to store carbon. This is especially true of coastal wetlands, because of their sensitivity to sea level rise. The goals of this study are to identify changes in the storage of carbon in wetland soils and releases to the atmosphere of the gases carbon dioxide and methane that occur as coastal wetland change from marshes dominated by grasses to mangrove forests. The research findings will provide valuable information for the conservation and restoration of the Florida Everglades locally as well as coastal wetlands throughout the world. Furthermore, the findings will provide a broader understanding of plant and soil interactions and ecosystem function in a changing world.

Specifically, the goals of this project are to: 1) Identify differences in carbon storage, accretion, and gas flux among wetlands dominated by brackish marsh, saltwater marsh, and mangrove-dominated vegetation communities. 2) Determine which abiotic and biotic mechanisms drive differences in soil carbon dynamics among wetland types. 3) Quantify the effect of time since mangrove establishment on soil carbon storage, accretion and gas flux by establishing a chronosequence of mangrove encroachment based on soil dating and historic aerial photography."

Lawyers need to convey information about the parties they represent; central banks provide information about the state of the economy; researchers disseminate results from their work; job candidates report their qualifications to potential employers; firms report their progress to investors. Complex information requires effort both to communicate and understand. Without resorting to dishonesty, an informed entity may be able to mitigate the effect of detrimental information by making it more difficult to decipher, for instance through information over-load or unclear language. While the development of information economics over the past fifty years has greatly improved our understanding of how information affects strategic behavior, many models still overlook the complexities of communicating, acquiring and processing information. The purpose of this study is to understand the extent of communication between individuals when information may be difficult to transmit and/or process. This project will clarify how attention and incentives shape behavior in such widely relevant settings, and why policies preventing lying or omission may be insufficient to address issues of transparency.<br/><br/>The project looks at the important interplay between communication, perception and strategic obfuscation from both theoretical and experimental angles. First, the PIs will examine the testable implications of a model of costly communication and perception; that is, they will characterize the set of observed behaviors which are consistent with their model for some underlying cost functions. Second, they will show how one can build on recent developments in experimental tests of rational inattention to test strategic obfuscation; that is, they move from an individual decision problem to the complexities of an interactive setting. Finally, they will test their theory experimentally using a novel experimental design that highlights the impact of limited perception on strategic obfuscation in communication games."

The International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 352 drilled 1.22 kilometers of volcanic rocks at water depths of 3.1-4.8 kilometers in the Bonin fore-arc in the western Pacific Ocean to investigate the start of subduction. This research performs a complete geochemical and petrological characterization of drilled fore-arc, seafloor, mafic, volcanic rocks, (i.e., basalts and boninites) recovered during the drilling expedition to better understand how subduction zone volcanism begins and evolves. The rock sequences encountered in the Bonin fore-arc are remarkably similar to those found in many ophiolites (ocean crust and upper mantle rocks found on the continents), so this project will also provide insights into the origin of ophiolites as well.

It will also provide funding to researchers at institutions in three EPSCoR states (Iowa, Utah, and Rhode Island) and foster international collaboration with Australian scientists.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to document the nature of the first crust produced after subduction initiation in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc system. Samples collected from four sites drilled during the International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 352 to the Bonin fore-arc will be analyzed. Drill cores from two of the sites primarily recovered fore-arc basalts and two recovered boninites.  This research, in collaboration with that being done by other members of the shipboard scientific party, will comprehensively analyze the recovered volcanic rocks, providing geochemical data on the major and trace element compositions of volcanic glasses. It will also complete analyses of oxygen isotopes, water and CO2 concentrations in the volcanic glasses; measurements of water concentrations in pyroxenes; Fe ratios in glasses; concentrations of fluid-mobile elements and B-Li isotopes in whole rocks and glasses; radiogenic Re-Os isotopes and PGE abundances in whole rocks and glasses; and major element and trace element compositions of whole rocks. Resulting data will be used to constrain melting processes and understand variations in the fluid, solid, and magma fluxes through the nascent mantle wedge from subduction initiation onward as the mode of magma generation changes from decompression melting to flux melting. The data will be used to address four principle scientific questions: (1) are fore arc basalts generated by decompression melting in a unique high temperature, low-pressure environment during rapid sea-floor spreading related to subduction initiation; (2) are the mantle sources of fore arc basalts and boninites unusually depleted and do they exhibit signatures of ancient recycled mantle or continental components; (3) were low- and high-Si boninites from drilling Sites U1439 and U1442 generated in succession from depleted mantle left after generation of fore arc basalts as spreading rates decreased and the involvement of subducted fluids increased; and (4) did magma generation migrate landward with time and to lower pressures. These questions align with the principal objectives of the NSF-funded International Ocean Discovery Program's Initial Science Plan, including testing the validity of the ophiolite model and understanding the initial origins of continental crust. Additionally the work will address questions in the NSF-funded GeoPRISMS science plan that focus on what the physical and chemical conditions are that control subduction zone initiation and the early development of arc systems."

Uniform heating of the manufactured part cannot solve this problem because it can cause warping of the 3D-printed structure that affects the mechanical reliability of three-dimensional (3D) printing as a plastic manufacturing technique. This research examines a novel manufacturing process where a thin coating of carbon nanotubes (CNTs) is deposited on the plastic filaments used in 3D printing. Microwave exposure of the printed parts causes the CNTs to heat that allows for localized polymer melting at the welds, resulting in markedly improved mechanical strength of the part. If successful, the additive manufacturing technology enabled by this project has the potential to overcome the current disparity between traditionally manufactured polymer parts such as injection molding, extrusion molding and machining as compared to parts printed with additive manufacturing techniques. <br/><br/>Specifically, this work uses a combination of experimentation and computation to measure and model the response of CNT-loaded polymer films in order to directly capture the coating thermal dynamics. This will be done using a combination of alternating current dielectric measurements, infrared imaging, and finite-element modeling (combining radio frequency heating and heat transfer in thin coatings). This will be followed by a scaled-up investigation of the coating, material extrusion, and controlled microwave exposure processes to demonstrate how this concept translates to an additive manufacturing context, with an emphasis on strength improvements (as measured on vertically printed tensile bars) and reliability. The microwave exposure will be carried out using simultaneous infrared imaging and real-time adjustment of forward power to yield consistent, specified heating treatments. The intellectual significance of the work stems from the translation of microscale CNT heating to processing-structure-property relationships for welds in complex, macroscale 3D printed structures. This work will have a strong impact on multiple scientific and engineering fields  including polymer physics, nanomaterial percolation, microwave physics, plastics processing, advanced manufacturing."

It is projected that 70 percent of the world's population will live in urban areas by 2050. The resiliency of tall buildings during and after a natural hazard event plays a vital role in maintaining economic and social stability of an urban region. In the case of earthquake hazard, current design methodologies for tall buildings focus only on preventing loss of human lives and building collapse, whereas damage-impaired losses are not being considered nor limited through the design. Recent earthquakes in Chile, Japan, and New Zealand highlighted that due to the great number of building occupants, seismic impacts would not be constrained within tall building footprints, but would also affect the community as a whole. To alleviate such earthquake consequences, this research will investigate an integrated system-level framework and metrics essential for understanding and modeling the earthquake-resilient design of tall buildings (e.g., repair losses, downtime, resiliency index, and expected annual loss). The research will focus on the development, validation, and integration of novel simulation tools and loss/recovery models that will envelope interaction between soil, foundation, structural, and nonstructural building components to provide a methodology for identifying engineering design requirements that will enable resiliency. Given the diverse student body of the participating universities, this project will enhance student experiences, particularly those of underrepresented groups, by active participation in a multi-campus interdisciplinary research project and collaborations with researchers and engineers in the U.S and globally. <br/><br/>This research will focus on tall buildings that utilize reinforced concrete core walls as the lateral load-resisting system, as it is currently the preferred system in construction of tall buildings. To develop the system-level framework, the research program will target four major areas that are essential to addressing the critical gaps in current simulation, assessment, and damage/loss/recovery estimation capabilities: 1) development and validation of a novel, three-dimensional, analytical model for reinforced concrete structural walls that integrates shear-flexural interaction and failure mechanisms, 2) evaluation of available soil models for simulating soil behavior and soil-foundation-structure interaction effects of tall buildings, 3) development of functionality limit states, downtime, and recovery models for tall buildings, and 4) integration of all framework components into a robust innovative tool for resilient-based design. The framework components will be validated based on test data available in the literature and archived in the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure data repository or in other data bases, and on data collected through earthquake reconnaissance reports and interviews with engineers, public officials, contractors, owners, and insurers. The framework will be demonstrated on a tall reinforced concrete core wall building located in an urban region with high seismicity. The framework will be applicable to all types of lateral-load resisting systems for tall buildings, including new and existing construction. The developed framework components will tackle the aforementioned critical gaps and provide valuable data sets to advance the natural hazard mitigation of civil infrastructure. This project will contribute to research and engineering communities by implementing the framework components into widely available computational platforms, disseminating research results using web-based tools, involving professionals and researchers in earthquake engineering during the project, and disseminating educational materials."

This often results in populations of a species evolving traits in response to local conditions that give an advantage to individuals in that native habitat but not in other habitats. Understanding the processes that drive such local adaptation is crucial to predicting the fate of species in the face of rapid environmental change. Many species are shifting their ranges to move poleward or to higher altitude sites as temperatures increase, but marine species are also at risk from ocean acidification - the ongoing decrease in ocean pH due to the uptake of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere. This is especially true for marine bivalves, who require specific carbonate chemistry to form their shells. The west coast of North America has natural long-standing variation in ocean pH and temperature; therefore, it is possible that some populations of wide-spread species could contain adaptations that have evolved in areas with low pH and higher temperatures. This may provide insight to scientists on what portions of the genome may be under selection in species during rapid climate warming events or highlight areas of the genome that have adapted to those conditions. The research provides training to a graduate student and additional outreach to commercial, government, non-governmental organizations, and public stakeholders. <br/><br/>	<br/>The proposed research will test whether adaptation to environmental variability has occurred in the Olympia oyster (Ostrea lurida).

Offspring of wild oysters will be raised under common conditions and studied for differences in growth rate, survival, and response to induced stress from temperature and pH.

Surface properties of a material are important for many applications. The capability to design and control surface texture would open opportunities to realize material surface properties that are otherwise unavailable, such as smart surfaces with tunable adhesion and self-cleaning properties. One viable approach to controllable surface texture is to create surface wrinkles, which can be accomplished easily by mechanically compressing a thin film coating attached to a relatively compliant substrate material. Current understanding in this field is well-developed for situations when both the thin film and the substrate material are elastic. However, many practical applications involve polymeric materials that are not elastic, but either viscous or viscoelastic, with time-dependent mechanical properties. Furthermore, complex surface textures with localized folds may be achieved on polymer surfaces by increasing compression. This research will enable potential applications using wrinkle-textured surfaces for controlling wettability, friction and adhesion, as well as stimulus responsive smart surfaces in energy, healthcare, aerospace, and automotive industries. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society. This research involves a collaboration between two institutions and across disciplines including mechanics, material science, and chemical engineering. The interdisciplinary collaboration will help broaden participation in research from diverse background and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>Past research on wrinkling has focused predominantly on thin films attached to soft elastic substrates. On viscoelastic substrates, however, wrinkling is kinetically-limited, and the wrinkle patterns intrinsically depend on the rate of compression. The primary hypothesis of this research is that the entire spectrum of the wrinkling behavior between the elastic and viscous limits can be exploited by using well-selected model polymeric materials. The research team will perform both computational and experimental studies. A simple and elegant method will be developed to impose well-controlled large compressive deformation on polymer-supported thin films, which allows the effects of strain and strain rate to be examined independently. Numerical simulations based on finite element method will be conducted in conjunction with experiments to understand the underlying mechanisms and to predict formation of wrinkles and folding structures. Beyond the immediate focus on viscoelastic substrates, this project will broadly elucidate the role of dissipative effects in a wide range of wrinkling and folding phenomena observed in nature."

The International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 352 drilled 1.22 kilometers of volcanic rocks at water depths of 3.1-4.8 kilometers in the Bonin fore-arc in the western Pacific Ocean to investigate the start of subduction. This research performs a complete geochemical and petrological characterization of drilled fore-arc, seafloor, mafic, volcanic rocks, (i.e., basalts and boninites) recovered during the drilling expedition to better understand how subduction zone volcanism begins and evolves.

Although this microbial partnership likely occurs in all animals, it remains unexplored in most. This project assesses the role of gut microbiota in caterpillars, some of which are globally destructive crop pests and thus of major economic interest. Understanding whether caterpillars are reliant on gut microbiota for feeding and growth could help in designing strategies for controlling them more effectively. Researchers will conduct an experiment using the tobacco hornworm caterpillar, a common pest of tomato and tobacco plants. Findings of this project will advance scientific understanding of how much animals and microbes have evolved to depend on each other.  This study will also provide research experience for a community college student and will engage the public through an educational workshop and a museum event.<br/><br/>Investigators will experimentally test the hypothesis that gut microbiota in the tobacco hornworm, Manduca sexta, affect host feeding behavior and fitness. The experiment will be based in southeastern Arizona, where a large population of wild M. sexta feed on the plant Datura wright-ii. To manipulate gut microbiota, researchers will use antibiotics to selectively remove microbes from D. wrightii without altering leaf chemical or nutritional properties. Feeding rates and development of the caterpillars, as well as fecundity of the resulting adult moths, will be measured and compared between control and antibiotic-treated groups. In addition, the size and composition of gut microbial communities will be characterized using DNA sequencing and fluorescence microscopy. Previous DNA sequencing data indicate that the number of microbes in the M. sexta gut is extremely low relative to other animals. Further, extreme chemical conditions within the caterpillar gut suggest that the gut microbes detected there are unlikely to be metabolically active. Therefore, the researchers anticipate that gut microbiota will not play a large role in host feeding or fitness. This result would challenge the current paradigm that animal growth and reproduction typically depend heavily upon microbial symbiosis."

One role they perform is the cycling of nutrients in these forested ecosystems. Although important, lichens and mosses are especially sensitive to the fallout from urban pollution. Preliminary studies indicate that exposure to urban pollutants may lead to dramatic shifts in the moss and lichen communities in forest canopies of the Pacific Northwest, including the total loss of very sensitive, yet ecologically important, lichens that can capture nitrogen from the air. Although the extreme sensitivity of these lichens makes them particularly vulnerable to atmospheric pollution, to date there has been no study to assess the impacts of the spread of urban environments on these forest canopy lichen communities or how nutrients are used in the canopy. This is particularly important as transportation and transportation-sourced pollutants increase throughout the Pacific Northwest. This research will create important new understanding of the impacts of growing urban environments on nearby tree canopies and forested ecosystems of the Pacific Northwest. The results obtained here will be useful to estimate how much nitrogen forests receive through pollution. Collectively, these efforts will aid researchers and government agencies in identifying canopy areas at risk of being damaged around the rapidly increasing urban centers in the Pacific Northwest. <br/><br/>Biodiversity loss associated with human alteration of ecosystems is a major planetary concern, and rapid expansion of global urban areas contributes to this loss. Urbanization can replace endemic species with widespread generalist species, creating a homogenized ecosystem with resulting impacts on ecosystem function. While many studies have identified land-use change as the main driver of terrestrial biodiversity loss, relatively few studies, to date, have explored how the transport and exposure of urban air plumes to downwind ecosystems may also be driving modern biodiversity loss. The Pacific Northwest is known for its many pristine, and iconic, coniferous forests that harbor an immense biomass and biodiversity of canopy epiphytes (lichens and mosses). Recently, the Pacific Northwest has experienced rapid population growth and many endemic tree canopy epiphytic species are extremely sensitive to the increasing effects of urbanization (increasing reactive nitrogen and heavy metal deposition). This research aims to assess how urban-induced shifts in epiphyte community structure influence Pacific Northwest forest ecosystem process by examining how community shifts in canopy epiphytes affect canopy nitrogen cycles. This study will address how rates of canopy cyanolichen nitrogen fixation vary across an established regional urbanization gradient and address the overall contribution of moss-associated nitrogen fixation potential in Pseudotsuga menziesii tree canopies, a previously unidentified source of canopy nitrogen fixation in Pacific Northwest forests."

The first research objective is to determine interactions between process parameters (nozzle diameter, extrusion pressure, and hydrogel concentration) and critical biological quality attributes (cell viability, density, and metabolic state) of benchmark bioprinted cellular constructs. To achieve this objective, the permittivity of printed constructs under the influence of an alternating electric field (100 KHz to 20 MHz) will be measured by using a dielectric probe. The obtained permittivity curves will be analyzed to extract beta-dispersion attributes (critical frequency, capacitance drop, and rate of capacitance change) which will be correlated to the bioprinting process parameters.  The second objective is to understand the mechanism responsible for alterations in cellular membrane polarization of encapsulated cells in a bioprinting process under an applied electric field. To achieve this objective, a multi-physics model of the bioprinting process will be developed, combining the dielectric properties of encapsulated cells, biomaterial properties, and cellular kinetics. The model will be experimentally calibrated through state-of-the-art offline characterization methods. It then will be used to predict the cellular polarization states under the influence of an electric field. Simulations results will be verified by measuring the biological quality attributes of the printed constructs. The third objective is to determine the effects of bioprinting process parameters on the dielectric properties of mammalian and bacterial cells. The extracted permittivity attributes will be used to predict the biological quality state of the constructs in real-time. These predictions will be confirmed by offline construct characterization methods."

Their applications range from daily goods (for example tires) to defense (for example sonar domes of navy ships) and to biomedicine (for example coatings of artery stents). This NSF-supported research/educational team led by a chemist (Jia) and a physicist/chemical engineer (Foster) combines inspirations from biological systems and lessons from chemical and physical principles to develop the next generation of elastomers. A central focus is to reduce the size of hard particles that strengthen the elastomers to the nanometer scale. The research team will advance our fundamental understanding of how these reinforcing elements produce elastomers that are strong, stiff, and extensible and that have programmed capability to dissipate energy. This scientific knowledge can be used for a number of applications, e.g. tires that are safe, durable, and fuel-efficient. The elastomers developed can also potentially be directly applied to make medical devices safer. Parallel to the research effort, the program will train undergraduate and graduate students in this interdisciplinary area. The team will carry out outreach activities aimed at attracting domestic talent to careers in science and technology and particularly in polymer-related areas using aspects of elastomers as the primary content materials.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY.  <br/><br/>The ability to manipulate atoms and molecules to form hierarchical structures with precisely controlled size and shape is central to nanoscience. Beta-sheet nanocrystals exist in both natural and synthetic elastomers and function as crosslinks and provide reinforcement. However, their morphologies are drastically different in these two circumstances. In natural elastomers (i.e., silks), they are particulates with all three dimensions smaller than 10 nm. In synthetic elastomers (e.g., polyurethanes), they have been found to be fibrous with the longest dimension, in the hydrogen-bonding direction, ranging from hundreds of nanometers to microns. In silks, the size control is attributed to specific amino acid sequences and an exquisite reeling process. Controlling the size and aspect ratio of beta-sheet nanocrystals is an unresolved challenge for synthetic systems.  This research pursues this central quest of nanoscience in an important area of soft materials, elastomers, to realize material properties otherwise unattainable.  The scientific approach of the research is multifaceted, involving synthesis, characterization, and mechanical studies across the molecular, supramolecular, and nanometer scales. Based on their recent success in reducing the longest dimension of n-beta-sheet nanocrystals in a series of oligo(beta-alanine)-grafted polyisobutylenes to well below 100 nm, the research team will expand their ability to regulate the size and aspect ratio of the beta-sheet nanocrystals without an elaborate aminoacid sequence and to elucidate the reinforcing characteristics of the two morphologically contrasting beta-sheet nanocrystals. The polymer brush at the interface of the nanocrystal will be another focus as it is critical for the morphological control and likely plays an important role in reinforcement as well.  The specific objectives of the planned research are to:  (1) synthesize monodisperse oligo(beta-alanine)-grafted polyisobutylenes that form particulate nanocrystals with still smaller aspect ratios as well as those that form fibrous nanocrystals.   (2) characterize the structures and morphologies of the beta-sheet nanocrystals including the polymer brush attached to the nanocrystal surface.   (3) elucidate the reinforcing characteristics and study the reinforcing mechanisms of the particulate and fibrous nanocrystals."

This deficit of understanding has been due in part to uncertainty surrounding relationships among the animals themselves and the difficulty of reconstructing the island's highly complex geological history. For many taxa, intra-island diversification patterns remain unclear due to a lack of sufficient geographic sampling. This study will evaluate the temporal and geographic patterns of colonization and intra-island diversification of terrestrial mammals on Sulawesi by using cuscus marsupials as a model system. Reconstructing the evolutionary relationships among cuscuses across this region will help elucidate the historical biogeography of Sulawesi. This research will significantly broaden the professional and technical development of an early career female scientist, who will also train and co-advise an undergraduate student.  <br/><br/>This project will test the hypothesis that microplate tectonics during the formation of Sulawesi and habitat fragmentation in the Pleistocene drove diversification in the Ailuropinae (Phalangeridae, Marsupialia). Extensive inter- and intra-island sampling with be achieved by using existing museum collections and novel methods of extracting ancient DNA. The researchers will incorporate traditional morphological techniques to distinguish and describe taxa along with phylogenomic methods to reconstruct their evolutionary relationships.  Biogeographical modeling will then be used to assess the likelihood of different geographical speciation scenarios. Using these results as a framework, the researchers will then produce a taxonomic revision of the subfamily."

It will also facilitate the understanding of the fundamental mechanism of the interaction between biopolymer proteins and incident radiation, that is, changes in proteins upon exposure to light.

The uses of protein-based biopolymers as resist and template materials for large-scale nanomanufacturing (e.g. roll-to-roll nanoimprinting) will be investigated as well. The research will also provide a new, cost-effective and eco-friendly methodology not only for pattern transferring but also for fabricating nanostructures that can serve as biointerfaces with the same or better resolution than conventional lithographic methods. This research, when implemented with high resolution characterization and lithography procedures, will find numerous applications including but not limited to biosensors, biophotonics, and biostructures for tissue engineering owing to the inherently superior biocompatibility compared to synthetic counterparts."

Disturbances such as fires can drastically change resource availability to plants. For example, ecosystems that experience frequent fires also experience surges of nitrogen availability after the fire. Although nitrogen is a crucial resource for all plants, nitrogen not captured by plants can be washed away and contribute to the pollution of streams and lakes. As such, it is important to understand how plant diversity might change if nitrogen availability changes, and subsequently how the ability of the plant community to retain nitrogen might also change. Investigators will examine whether plant communities that have experienced frequent pulses of nitrogen are better able to capture nitrogen and prevent it from leaving the ecosystem than are plant communities that have not experienced nitrogen pulses. This research will help to predict how plant communities respond to changes in nitrogen availability, and how patterns of nitrogen retention and loss are affected by fire frequency. As part of this project, one undergraduate student will gain hands-on experience in field ecology and laboratory chemical analyses.  In addition, the investigators will develop teaching activities to improve understanding of N cycling at local and global scales by undergraduate students. Data from this study will be added to a database used to estimate the global carbon cycle. The findings of the study will be disseminated in peer-reviewed journals and at national conferences.<br/><br/>This project is an empirical field test of patterns identified in greenhouse studies of interspecific differences in pulsed nitrogen assimilation. The researchers will trace the fate of nitrogen into different ecosystem compartments in a longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) forest, using isotope analysis in sites with contrasting historical fire frequencies (annual burns or fire suppression). Researchers will measure the amount of isotope stored in microbial biomass, aboveground and belowground biomass of dominant plant species, and the bulk soil pool. By comparing the amount of nitrogen stored in different compartments between sites under annual burn or fire suppression regimes, they will assess the extent to which plant communities exposed to frequent nitrogen pulses are adapted to capturing this ephemeral resource. Further, they will test whether these interspecific differences in the capacity to capture pulsed nitrogen scale up to influence ecosystem-level nitrogen retention patterns in the field. The researchers predict that shifts in community composition favoring species adapted to assimilating ephemeral nitrogen will result in increased nitrogen retention in frequently burned sites, as compared to fire-suppressed sites."

The project will result in a proof-of-concept demonstration of our product operating in freely moving animals.  The fiber-coupled miniature multiphoton microscope will allow full three-dimensional scanning through active focusing with no mechanically moving parts in a compact, light weight design.  The product can be readily connected to a commercial-laser scanning microscope. These features allow for reduced cost, flexibility in configuration of the wavelength or imaging modality to be performed, and can provide imaging over larger brain volumes when compared to the leading head-mounted microscope systems in this market space.<br/><br/>This project addresses the following technology gaps as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application.  Although light microscopy has rapidly advanced for studies of biological systems, one major gap is the ability to use these advanced imaging tools for dynamic studies in the brain in freely moving animals.  We propose to combine the advantages of two-photon excitation with depth scanning using adaptive optics in a compact fiber-coupled design.  Current commercially available miniature microscopes only allow for single imaging planes, do not enable active focusing during imaging and do not allow both targeted imaging and optogenetic stimulation. The miniature multiphoton fiber-coupled microscope will use a fiber-bundle to translate the laser-scanned signal to the distal microscope head and miniature adaptable optical elements to provide fast active focusing. This will accomplish high versatility for applications such as fast region-of-interest imaging, optogenetic stimulation, and depth imaging with multiphoton techniques. Personnel involved in this project including undergraduate and graduate students, will receive experience in technology translation through meetings with business partners, attending technology conferences, and participating in outreach events.<br/><br/>This project engages 3i (Intelligent Imaging Innovations), an international company that specializes in delivering advanced optical microscope systems.

However, the two sexes often experience dramatic differences in natural selection on these shared traits. This can create an evolutionary tug-of-war when a trait and its underlying genes are beneficial in one sex, but detrimental in the other. This study will investigate this selection conflict in brown anole lizards. Such conflict can occur in any species with separate sexes and is predicted to have important implications for the evolution of differences between males and females, systems of sex determination, and the maintenance of genetic variation. The researchers will genetically sequence individuals from a wild population with extreme sex differences to identify genomic regions that are subject to this selection conflict. In addition, this project will provide research training for undergraduate students and the research will be used as the basis for developing field-tested educational materials designed to build skills for data interpretation in the K-12 classroom.<br/><br/>Despite its implications for so many major questions in biology, sexual conflict has rarely been demonstrated in wild populations, and we have yet to identify the actual regions of the genome that are subject to sexual conflict in natural populations. This project has three aims: (1) test for sex differences in natural selection on a variety of traits, (2) test for fitness costs of sexual conflict by measuring the extent to which the genetic basis of fitness is correlated between males and females, and (3) combine field estimates of fitness with large-scale genomic data and powerful statistical methods to uncover genomic regions associated with sexual conflict in a wild population of brown anole lizards (Anolis sagrei). This work is being conducted using an island population of more than a thousand adult lizards that is highly amenable to large-scale studies of natural selection. The researchers will use their data to test whether the same genomic regions contribute to fitness in each sex, to measure the extent to which these genes are subject to sex differences in selection, and to determine which components of fitness (survival, reproductive success) give rise to intralocus sexual conflict."

It is projected that 70 percent of the world's population will live in urban areas by 2050. The resiliency of tall buildings during and after a natural hazard event plays a vital role in maintaining economic and social stability of an urban region. In the case of earthquake hazard, current design methodologies for tall buildings focus only on preventing loss of human lives and building collapse, whereas damage-impaired losses are not being considered nor limited through the design. Recent earthquakes in Chile, Japan, and New Zealand highlighted that due to the great number of building occupants, seismic impacts would not be constrained within tall building footprints, but would also affect the community as a whole. To alleviate such earthquake consequences, this research will investigate an integrated system-level framework and metrics essential for understanding and modeling the earthquake-resilient design of tall buildings (e.g., repair losses, downtime, resiliency index, and expected annual loss). The research will focus on the development, validation, and integration of novel simulation tools and loss/recovery models that will envelope interaction between soil, foundation, structural, and nonstructural building components to provide a methodology for identifying engineering design requirements that will enable resiliency. Given the diverse student body of the participating universities, this project will enhance student experiences, particularly those of underrepresented groups, by active participation in a multi-campus interdisciplinary research project and collaborations with researchers and engineers in the U.S and globally. <br/><br/>This research will focus on tall buildings that utilize reinforced concrete core walls as the lateral load-resisting system, as it is currently the preferred system in construction of tall buildings. To develop the system-level framework, the research program will target four major areas that are essential to addressing the critical gaps in current simulation, assessment, and damage/loss/recovery estimation capabilities: 1) development and validation of a novel, three-dimensional, analytical model for reinforced concrete structural walls that integrates shear-flexural interaction and failure mechanisms, 2) evaluation of available soil models for simulating soil behavior and soil-foundation-structure interaction effects of tall buildings, 3) development of functionality limit states, downtime, and recovery models for tall buildings, and 4) integration of all framework components into a robust innovative tool for resilient-based design. The framework components will be validated based on test data available in the literature and archived in the Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure data repository or in other data bases, and on data collected through earthquake reconnaissance reports and interviews with engineers, public officials, contractors, owners, and insurers. The framework will be demonstrated on a tall reinforced concrete core wall building located in an urban region with high seismicity. The framework will be applicable to all types of lateral-load resisting systems for tall buildings, including new and existing construction. The developed framework components will tackle the aforementioned critical gaps and provide valuable data sets to advance the natural hazard mitigation of civil infrastructure. This project will contribute to research and engineering communities by implementing the framework components into widely available computational platforms, disseminating research results using web-based tools, involving professionals and researchers in earthquake engineering during the project, and disseminating educational materials."

If plants flower when bees are not active, reproduction could fail.

We know that environmental variation effects the evolution and distribution of species. However, we do not know the molecular bases for how organisms adapt to this variation. A major challenge is to understand how molecular processes occurring in local populations relate to global species' distribution patterns over evolutionary time. This is difficult because evidence of adaptation can disappear over time, and because population genetic patterns can mimic adaptation. This project will compare several populations and species of Andean hummingbirds. Modern genetic methods will be used to measure natural selection on proteins while also taking account of population genetic structure. In addition, the project will include the training of high school and undergraduate students, and produce educational materials for genomic workshops.<br/><br/>This project will bridge the gap between macroevolutionary distribution patterns and microevolutionary processes of adaptation. The goals are to test for genetic adaptation to high-altitude conditions in Andean hummingbird populations while controlling for demographic history, and to test for parallel evolution across populations that independently colonized the high Andes. Hummingbirds are an excellent system for studying genetic adaptation across altitudinal gradients. There are more than 300 species, they occur across a vast gradient - sea level to over 4000 meters - despite having the highest basal metabolic rates of any bird group, and there have been at least four independent colonization events of high-altitude habitats. The researchers will collect genomic data from 6-30 populations of two low and two high altitude species to test the hypothesis that adaptive changes in protein-coding genes shape altitudinal distributions in hummingbird populations that have recently colonized the high Andes. Researchers will use the genomic data to detect signatures of positive selection, an indicator of genetic adaptation, and measure population genetic structure across populations. The results of these analyses will provide critical insight into the mechanisms of colonization and adaptation to high elevation ecosystems."

These invasive species have come at an economic and ecological cost for the US, harming agriculture, fisheries, and our iconic landscapes. On islands, these invaders are even more detrimental, often competing with or eating native species to the brink of extinction and thus irreversibly damaging biodiversity hotspots. In this project, researchers will take an innovative approach to understand the consequences of invasive species by combining data from 15,000-year-old fossils and modern specimens alike. Using fossils excavated in the Dominican Republic, researchers will reconstruct the ecological interactions of native mammal species (such as sloths, monkeys, and rodents) before and after the arrival of prehistoric humans (6,000 years ago), as well as after the arrival of Europeans (500 years ago) and the invasive species that accompanied them. A baseline of how native species respond to extinction will provide context for understanding where invasive species fit within the modern ecosystem. For example, do invasive herbivores such as goats consume vegetation similar to what was consumed by extinct native sloths? This research integrates paleontology with conservation science to directly inform ecosystem restoration efforts. The lessons learned from this research will be broadly applicable to species invasions on islands and continents alike. <br/><br/>The researchers excavated a cave deposit extending from the modern day back across the Late Pleistocene-Holocene transition, a period known globally for climatic changes and megafaunal extinctions. This fossil record provides ecological snapshots of species interactions through evolutionary time. Using stratigraphic layers and radiocarbon dating, the researchers will establish a temporal framework for the fossil remains, describing which mammalian species were present at what time periods in the past. This chronology permits researchers to test ecological hypotheses of how species respond to environmental and anthropogenic perturbations through time. Food webs, species interactions, and changes in resource use can be reconstructed using stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen. Through applying these isotopes, researchers will assess the trophic position and niche breadth of each native species in response to extinction and invasion events, thereby testing broad ecological concepts such as competitive release and niche contraction. They will also evaluate the longstanding assumption that invasive species have wider niche breadths relative to native species in the ecosystems they invade."

Undergraduate students from underrepresented groups will participate in hands-on research; through this engagement, the research will foster a new generation of critically thinking young scientists.     <br/><br/>This project characterizes carbon allocation patterns in native and invasive woody plants growing in deciduous forest understories.  It will evaluate the relationship between growth rates and carbon storage allocation, and how allocation to defense mediates this relationship.  Researchers will test the general hypothesis that invasive plants allocate more carbon toward growth at the expense of storage allocation in order to outcompete native plants for resources.  Storage compounds, in the form of starches and simple sugars, are critical for recovery from tissue damage and protection from frost events.  Preliminary data show that invasive species have higher growth rates and produce more leaves in response to leaf removal, but it is unknown whether this comes at a loss of storage compounds that promote survival.  An insect feeding experiment on a range of native and invasive species' leaves will be carried out to assess allocation to physical and chemical defenses, and a freezing experiment will elucidate the relationship between stem starch and sugar concentrations in different species and their ability to tolerate cold temperatures.  These activities will test the hypothesis that invasive species possess lower carbon storage and defense allocation than native species, and that this difference leads to lower survival in response to leaf removal and freezing events, and lower resistance to herbivore feeding."

Newly discovered, emerging diseases are a significant threat to biological diversity and human health. Many of these emerging diseases are caused by fungal pathogens. Yet few studies have addressed the evolutionary ecology of disease-causing fungi. A notorious emerging fungal disease is the amphibian-killing chytrid fungus, which is contributing to worldwide amphibian declines and biodiversity loss. Despite intensive research since its discovery in 1999, the origins and evolutionary trajectory of this disease remain a mystery. This project will investigate a region of high chytrid diversity in the Atlantic Forest of southern Brazil to understand how competition among different fungal strains determines the success and evolution of these pathogens. Understanding how emerging diseases evolve will be critical to controlling future disease outbreaks. The project includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students, along with K-12 outreach programs and museum displays that highlight effects of introduced diseases on ecosystem health.<br/><br/>Prior research suggests that divergent amphibian-killing chytrid strains in Brazil's Atlantic Forest are competing for hosts. According to theory, competing disease strains should evolve to have faster rates of growth and increased virulence until a single most successful strain has eliminated all others. This project will investigate how these chytrid disease strains initially came into contact, and the ecological and evolutionary outcomes of this contact. The researchers will reconstruct the divergence history of Brazilian Atlantic Forest disease strains using whole genome sequences of pathogen isolates collected from the region. They will then conduct a cross-strain competition experiment on a model amphibian host. The genomes of experimental pathogen strains will be sequenced before and after the experiment to link genotypic changes to phenotypic change in post-competition virulence. These data will allow the researchers to establish the timing of contact between pathogen populations, and to determine if accelerated virulence evolves due to direct competition among strains."

Surface properties of a material are important for many applications. The capability to design and control surface texture would open opportunities to realize material surface properties that are otherwise unavailable, such as smart surfaces with tunable adhesion and self-cleaning properties. One viable approach to controllable surface texture is to create surface wrinkles, which can be accomplished easily by mechanically compressing a thin film coating attached to a relatively compliant substrate material. Current understanding in this field is well-developed for situations when both the thin film and the substrate material are elastic. However, many practical applications involve polymeric materials that are not elastic, but either viscous or viscoelastic, with time-dependent mechanical properties. Furthermore, complex surface textures with localized folds may be achieved on polymer surfaces by increasing compression. This research will enable potential applications using wrinkle-textured surfaces for controlling wettability, friction and adhesion, as well as stimulus responsive smart surfaces in energy, healthcare, aerospace, and automotive industries. Therefore, results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society. This research involves a collaboration between two institutions and across disciplines including mechanics, material science, and chemical engineering. The interdisciplinary collaboration will help broaden participation in research from diverse background and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>Past research on wrinkling has focused predominantly on thin films attached to soft elastic substrates. On viscoelastic substrates, however, wrinkling is kinetically-limited, and the wrinkle patterns intrinsically depend on the rate of compression. The primary hypothesis of this research is that the entire spectrum of the wrinkling behavior between the elastic and viscous limits can be exploited by using well-selected model polymeric materials. The research team will perform both computational and experimental studies. A simple and elegant method will be developed to impose well-controlled large compressive deformation on polymer-supported thin films, which allows the effects of strain and strain rate to be examined independently. Numerical simulations based on finite element method will be conducted in conjunction with experiments to understand the underlying mechanisms and to predict formation of wrinkles and folding structures. Beyond the immediate focus on viscoelastic substrates, this project will broadly elucidate the role of dissipative effects in a wide range of wrinkling and folding phenomena observed in nature."

Cranial appendages are often used to determine how species are related to the different families of Pecora, because each family is distinguished by the presence of a specific type of appendage. When fossil species lack cranial appendages, it is difficult to assign them reliably to any particular family. These appendage-less fossil species could provide necessary information about the ancestral origins of cranial appendages in each family, but the inability to confidently place them in the context of pecoran evolutionary relationships precludes their use in studies of cranial appendage evolution. Prior studies have shown that variation in the way structures change as an animal grows can result in the origination of totally new structures. A better understanding of cranial appendage development will therefore provide much-needed context for hoofed mammal cranial appendage evolution and help resolve the question of their origins. It will also contribute to research on how skin and connective tissues contribute to bone growth and have implications for understanding pathways and patterns of skull development, with methods and results that are broadly applicable to skull and bone growth research in all vertebrates, including humans. This research will form the basis of a curriculum on genomic analyses and genetics for middle school students in the American Museum of Natural History's Lang Science Program, piloted with diverse groups of New York schoolchildren and available to teachers and schools across the country. <br/><br/>This project will test two competing hypotheses: 1) the broad range of distinctive cranial appendages observed in fossil and extant pecoran artiodactyls do not share a common evolutionary origin, 2) portions of cranial appendages, such as the permanent bone pedicles of antlers and the bone cores of horns, may be homologous across some or all of the appendage types in this clade. Samples will be collected from the cranial appendage forming tissues of at least three individuals each from the four extant cranial-appendage-bearing families of Pecora (Bovidae, Cervidae, Giraffidae, and Antilocapridae) and an appendage-less outgroup taxon from Tragulidae, at 3 developmental stages: birth, one month, and two months old. RNA will be isolated from these tissues and sequenced using next-generation sequencing technologies. Gene expression profiles sequenced from tissues at a second location on the body of each individual will provide a somatic control to estimate gene expression specifically related to cranial appendage growth (the cranial appendage transcriptome). These transcriptomes will be optimized onto a phylogeny to test for homology of the genes responsible for cranial appendage growth across and within age groups."

These statistical methods will enable researchers to assess risk of chronic diseases, such as cancer, and other health outcomes, such as pre-term births, as a function of the geographic-specific exposures associated with residential history.  The new statistical methods will provide researchers with a robust and powerful tool for using residential histories when they test hypotheses about geographic exposures over time and space and their impacts on health and disease.  The project will increase basic understanding of the amount of information bias introduced when residential histories are ignored.  Project results will provide empirical examples for geographers, public officials, and other scientists that demonstrate why residential history data should be used in health and disease surveillance systems, how these data can be incorporated, and why this information should be included when conducting health geographic analysis.  Project methods and findings will assist those addressing a broader set of health-related issues.  The use of the data from a state cancer registry and a birth registry will provide insights regarding the use of administrative databases to obtain residential histories for health geographic analysis.  The new methods will be adaptable for use by researchers and by public health practitioners and medical personnel in addressing problems besides long-latency diseases.  By analyzing daily-scale movement, for example, it will be possible to map acute diseases like salmonella or health events like asthma attacks.  The project also will provide education and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students in health and medical geography, computer science, and epidemiology.<br/><br/>Common methods for assessing risk factors based on geographic-specific exposures or the clustering of health and disease events generally have relied on static data limited to a single point in time and space, such as a person's location at the time of diagnosis.  Ignoring residential history is a significant shortcoming in such analyses because of the latency period between causative exposures and resulting health and disease events.  The investigators will address this shortcoming by providing a framework for combining multipoint, longitudinal residential history data with health and disease data that is normally based on a single time point.  Building upon previous research in health geography, geographical information sciences, and data mining, they will develop hierarchical Bayes models that assess risk of disease while accounting for latency and temporally changing social and environmental exposures, geographic uncertainty, and missing data.  They will test and demonstrate these new statistical models using both synthetic data and empirical secondary datasets of cancer and birth outcomes that include residential histories."

From robotics to human-computer interaction, there are numerous real-world tasks that benefit from practical systems to identify objects in scenes based on language and understand language based on visual context. In particular, the project develops the first language-based image authoring tool which allows users to edit or synthesize realistic imagery using only natural language (e.g. ""delete the garbage truck from this photo"" or ""make an image with three boys chasing a shaggy dog"").

They also advance image manipulation by enabling systems that can synthesize images starting from a textual description, or modify images based on natural language commands. The main technical contributions of the project are:  (1) benchmark datasets for TIRR with comprehensive large-scale gold standard annotations that will make TIRR a standard task for recognition; (2) principled new representations for text-to-image annotations that expose the compositional nature of language using the formalism of the denotation graph; (3) new models for TIRR that perform an explicit alignment (grounding) of words and phrases to image regions guided by the structure of the denotation graph; (4) applications of TIRR methods to referring expression understanding and visual question answering; and (5) applications of TIRR to image creation and manipulation based on natural language input."

One example is the 2011 earthquake and tsunami in northern Japan that killed more than 20,000 people and crippled the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear complex. These earthquakes arise from friction on the subduction zone fault that separates the two tectonic plates.  The temperature of the subduction fault zone affects this friction and can control the size and distribution of earthquakes. In addition, subduction zone temperatures affect a wide range of other physical and chemical processes, including the generation of magma that supplies nearby volcanoes. To understand these processes, it is important to accurately estimate subduction zone temperatures. Recent discoveries show that seawater circulating within the subducting tectonic plates is an important control on subduction zone temperatures. This project will examine how fractures that open in the upper part of a tectonic plate as it bends down into a subduction zone affect seawater circulation in the system and how that affects subduction zone temperatures. The project will develop numerical thermal models for seven subduction zones. Application of the results of this research has direct societal benefit, by informing earthquake hazard estimates. In addition, the project will enhance education at New Mexico Tech, a STEM-focused Hispanic-serving institution. A graduate student will be trained in geophysics and hydrogeology. Results of the project will be incorporated into ""using data in the classroom"" efforts, improving hands-on experience in undergraduate courses.<br/><br/>Accurate subduction zone thermal models are necessary to understand frictional behavior, metamorphic reaction progress, release of volatiles from the subducting slab, mantle wedge hydration, subduction dynamics, and melt generation. Fluid circulation in an oceanic crustal aquifer is an important control on subduction zone temperatures. However, there are contrasting hypotheses for how much of the oceanic crust can host vigorous hydrothermal circulation. Both thickening of the oceanic crustal aquifer via plate bending normal faults and fluid circulation between subducted crust and the crust seaward of the trench may contribute to the advective redistribution of heat that affects subduction zone temperatures. This project will test the hypothesis that the thermal effects of aquifer thickening prior to subduction are greater for slabs with a greater degree of curvature. This project will exploit the fact that aquifer thickening from the outer rise to the trench and continued fluid circulation in subducting crust are expected to produce distinct surface heat flux anomalies (a broad low amplitude anomaly for aquifer thickening; a narrow high amplitude anomaly for fluid circulation in subducting crust) in order to constrain the thermal effects of each process. This will advance our understanding of the fluid circulation process that is an important control on subduction zone temperatures, improving subduction zone thermal models for the seven margins examined in this project and others."

These would contain high loadings of specifically chosen chemical groups delivered by specially designed polymer units and could be readily prepared by industrially practiced polymerization processes.  These polymeric materials could provide practical candidates for acid gas and heavy metal ion capture (e.g., carbon dioxide, hydrogen sulfide, heavy-metal ions).  Some of these polymers could also lead to practical high-surface-area polymer particles for enhancing reversible storage of hydrogen.  Results from this project will be reported at major scientific conferences and published in high-impact journals.

Precise insertion of semi-rigid segments from alternating copolymers into hypercrosslinked polymer particles delivers new chemical backbone units to modify properties of network systems.  Precise control of placement of functional groups from strictly alternating sequences will enable unique solid state constructs that are expected to provide excellent control over physical properties of the resulting networks. For hypercrosslinked systems, these semi-rigid units slow pore collapse during the hypercrosslinking step.  Computational collaboration will help guide the development of the fundamentals for designing higher surface area functional particles. These new hypercrosslinked polymeric materials will possess high surface areas with high concentrations of functional groups designed for specific interactions with gas sorbates, metal ions, or other reactive molecules.  Comparison of semi-rigid chain stiffening sequences to less sterically crowded functional copolymer sequences will assist in elucidating the role of chain stiffness on fundamental structure property relationships. Recent discoveries with semi-rigid structures containing carboxylic acid functional group will be expanded to hypercrosslinked polymeric materials with primary and secondary amine groups and phenolic groups precisely enchained in the polymer backbone.    It is anticipated that these new functional nanoporous particles will be effective solid sorbents for carbon dioxide and other acidic gases.  Hypercrosslinked nanoporous polymer particles containing aromatic amines will be targeted also and their potential for hydrogen storage studied."

Robber flies in the genus Lasiopogon are a widespread group of insect predators that hunt in many environments, such as dunes, beaches, trails, streamsides, and sagebrush landscapes. Specializations such as perching habits or seasonal emergence times provide a way for species with overlapping ranges to reduce competition. The goal of this project is to compare diversification patterns and similarities in geographic range, niche, and morphology throughout the 60 species of North American Lasiopogon to uncover not just when and where a given species split, but how regional communities (i.e., who it evolved with) influenced this diversification. Understanding the processes of adaptation at regional and local scales will help show how environmental cues and interactions among species maintain and promote biodiversity, providing lessons about potential responses of species to shifting environments. This research will promote taxonomic expertise and training in a diverse but understudied group of insects (robber flies). Furthermore, since many Lasiopogon species have highly specialized habitat requirements, this work will provide data for studying community changes precipitated by urban spread, manmade irrigation, and climate change. An undergraduate student will be trained in Asilidae taxonomic and biodiversity research, and distributional and ecological information&#8232;from this study will be shared on general and taxon-specific websites. <br/><br/><br/>Species niches are a distillation of their interactions with other members of the community and their phylogenetic history.

The project will train one graduate student and several undergraduates in laboratory techniques.  Results from the research will be integrated within new teaching materials for middle school, high school and undergraduate students that emphasize the domestication process and importance of diversity in crop breeding programs.<br/><br/>This research will characterize the timing of whole genome duplication events within sweet potato (Ipomoea batatas) and closely related species, and test whether these events are linked to the evolution of storage roots in the group. Numerous studies have implicated polyploidy as a major driving factor in the evolution of complex phenotypes; however, few studies have linked whole genome duplication events with the evolution of novel root traits. This study will apply modern phylogenomic methods to estimate relationships within the Ipomoea batatas complex and reconstruct the history of polyploidization and storage root development in the group. Genetic markers developed through gene capture and Restriction site Associated DNA Sequencing (RADSeq) technologies through this research will be useful for germplasm stock centers characterizing and preserving diversity within sweet potato and across the Ipomoea batatas complex. These findings will advance sweet potato breeding efforts, including recent work to develop productive and robust cultivars for Africa."

While hybridization has traditionally been viewed as normally inconsequential to species integrity and the speciation process (hybrids were assumed to be inviable for some reason), there is growing evidence it may actually be beneficial and accelerate speciation under some circumstances. Understanding the origins of biodiversity requires more thorough knowledge of mechanisms that may alter the outcome of hybridization. One such mechanism is the rearrangement of chromosomes that may change the genomic structure of species in a way that limits the potential for hybridization. This project will study a model fish species, topminnows, in order to understand how divergence and chromosomal rearrangements may interact to determine the dynamics of naturally occurring hybrid zones. The research will also be used in development of high school curricula to teach evolutionary concepts and to provide research experiences for undergraduates.  <br/><br/>Topminnows in the Fundulus notatus species complex have broadly overlapping ranges throughout much of the Mississippi River basin and northern Gulf of Mexico drainages. Earlier work with these species identified a number of replicate hybrid zones where the hybridizing species and populations differ in levels of divergence and, in some cases, chromosome number.  The researchers will use modern genomic tools to quantify the amount of hybridization and patterns of introgression in eight replicate hybrid zones. Artificial breeding experiments in the laboratory will produce progeny that will facilitate the production of genetic maps of hybridizing populations. Genetic maps will elucidate spatial patterns of gene flow in replicate hybrid zones. Experimental hybrid zone trials will also examine mate choice dynamics and the viability of hybrid offspring."

Many plants have physical defenses such as spines, thorns, or prickles that protect them against large mammalian herbivores (e.g., elephants, giraffes, deer, and elk); however, producing and maintaining these defenses is energetically costly. As a result, plants that produce more spines and thorns are less vulnerable to herbivory, but also have fewer resources to invest in growth and reproduction, two critical components of plant fitness. This tradeoff is particularly acute for plants in dry or infertile African savannas, where resources (e.g., water and nutrients) are scarce and the risk of being eaten by large herbivores is high. As a result, theory predicts the emergence of strategies that maximize the effectiveness of defenses while reducing their cost. Two such strategies are induced defenses (produced rapidly in response to damage by herbivores) and associational defenses (reduced incidence of herbivory derived from growing in close proximity to a well-defended neighbor). <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to evaluate the relative effectiveness of, and interactions between, these anti-herbivore strategies and to determine how positive associational interactions among plants of different species alter patterns of resource investment. Plants facing the same evolutionary pressures frequently converge on similar suites of defensive characteristics, known as defense syndromes. In African savannas, individuals of the same species can exhibit strongly contrasting defense syndromes depending on their proximity to well-defended neighbors. Plants growing beneath thorny tree canopies, for example, produce fewer spines and exhibit a diminished induced response to simulated herbivory relative to conspecifics growing in open habitat. The researchers hypothesize that this difference is maintained by a disparity in the environmental cues that govern defensive investment in plants and will test this hypothesis using transplant experiments of focal plant species conducted inside and outside of large-herbivore exclosures in the Mpala Research Centre, Kenya. The researchers will also perform surveys of multiple species to evaluate how common intraspecific variation in defense syndrome is across plant taxa. By investigating the biotic and/or abiotic forces that maintain discrete intraspecific defense syndromes, this research will elucidate the independent and interactive effects of different anti-herbivore strategies on plant fitness and help inform the management of rangelands and the conservation of native vegetation in African savannas."

This project will investigate some of the least understood aspects this globally important process: what causes it to start, what kind of crust is produced after subduction starts, and what materials are released from the subducting slab as it initially sinks. The International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 352 drilled 1.22 kilometers of volcanic rocks at water depths of 3.1-4.8 kilometers in the Bonin fore-arc in the western Pacific Ocean to investigate the start of subduction. This research performs a complete geochemical and petrological characterization of drilled fore-arc, seafloor, mafic, volcanic rocks, (i.e., basalts and boninites) recovered during the drilling expedition to better understand how subduction zone volcanism begins and evolves. The rock sequences encountered in the Bonin fore-arc are remarkably similar to those found in many ophiolites (ocean crust and upper mantle rocks found on the continents), so this project will also provide insights into the origin of ophiolites as well. This project supports and expands the extensive international scientific collaborations developed during Expedition 352 to include additional top-flight female scientists as well as undergraduate and graduate researchers.  Results from this project will become part of classroom resources supported by an ongoing NSF-funded education project.  It will also provide funding to researchers at institutions in three EPSCoR states (Iowa, Utah, and Rhode Island) and foster international collaboration with Australian scientists.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to document the nature of the first crust produced after subduction initiation in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc system. Samples collected from four sites drilled during the International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 352 to the Bonin fore-arc will be analyzed. Drill cores from two of the sites primarily recovered fore-arc basalts and two recovered boninites.  This research, in collaboration with that being done by other members of the shipboard scientific party, will comprehensively analyze the recovered volcanic rocks, providing geochemical data on the major and trace element compositions of volcanic glasses. It will also complete analyses of oxygen isotopes, water and CO2 concentrations in the volcanic glasses; measurements of water concentrations in pyroxenes; Fe ratios in glasses; concentrations of fluid-mobile elements and B-Li isotopes in whole rocks and glasses; radiogenic Re-Os isotopes and PGE abundances in whole rocks and glasses; and major element and trace element compositions of whole rocks. Resulting data will be used to constrain melting processes and understand variations in the fluid, solid, and magma fluxes through the nascent mantle wedge from subduction initiation onward as the mode of magma generation changes from decompression melting to flux melting. The data will be used to address four principle scientific questions: (1) are fore arc basalts generated by decompression melting in a unique high temperature, low-pressure environment during rapid sea-floor spreading related to subduction initiation; (2) are the mantle sources of fore arc basalts and boninites unusually depleted and do they exhibit signatures of ancient recycled mantle or continental components; (3) were low- and high-Si boninites from drilling Sites U1439 and U1442 generated in succession from depleted mantle left after generation of fore arc basalts as spreading rates decreased and the involvement of subducted fluids increased; and (4) did magma generation migrate landward with time and to lower pressures. These questions align with the principal objectives of the NSF-funded International Ocean Discovery Program's Initial Science Plan, including testing the validity of the ophiolite model and understanding the initial origins of continental crust. Additionally the work will address questions in the NSF-funded GeoPRISMS science plan that focus on what the physical and chemical conditions are that control subduction zone initiation and the early development of arc systems."

From robotics to human-computer interaction, there are numerous real-world tasks that benefit from practical systems to identify objects in scenes based on language and understand language based on visual context. In particular, the project develops the first language-based image authoring tool which allows users to edit or synthesize realistic imagery using only natural language (e.g. ""delete the garbage truck from this photo"" or ""make an image with three boys chasing a shaggy dog""). Beyond the immediate impact of creating new ways for users to access and author digital images, the broader impacts of this work include three focus areas: the development of new benchmarks for the vision and language communities, outreach and undergraduate research, and leadership in promoting diversity. <br/><br/>At the core of the project are new techniques for large-scale text-to-image reference resolution (TIRR) that enable systems to automatically identify the image regions that depict entities described in natural language sentences or commands.

They also advance image manipulation by enabling systems that can synthesize images starting from a textual description, or modify images based on natural language commands. The main technical contributions of the project are:  (1) benchmark datasets for TIRR with comprehensive large-scale gold standard annotations that will make TIRR a standard task for recognition; (2) principled new representations for text-to-image annotations that expose the compositional nature of language using the formalism of the denotation graph; (3) new models for TIRR that perform an explicit alignment (grounding) of words and phrases to image regions guided by the structure of the denotation graph; (4) applications of TIRR methods to referring expression understanding and visual question answering; and (5) applications of TIRR to image creation and manipulation based on natural language input."

Species in mimetic systems often exhibit diverse geographic morphologies, which raises questions about how this diversity originated and is maintained. Addressing this question will quantify the role of natural selection in promoting and maintaining genetic differentiation among populations. Additionally, this research will provide a basis for using morphological traits to predict levels of genetic structure. The later will be especially useful for conservation purposes, particularly in groups or systems in which genetic data might not be available.<br/><br/>These goals will be addressed by conducting a fine scale landscape genetic study on mimetic beetles from the genus Ceroglossus using next generation sequencing data.

These microdomains can have dimensions of a few nanometers (billionths of a meter) and above, and their geometry and chemistry can be controlled through the design of the block copolymer. Most work has focused on block copolymers with two types of microdomains, but this project examines the behavior of block copolymers in which three different types of microdomain are simultaneously present, producing a wide range of complex geometries. It investigates the conditions under which different arrangements of microdomains are formed in thin films of these materials, and it demonstrates their technological usefulness, in particular for semiconductor device manufacturing, where the microdomain patterns can be used to define features smaller than those available from conventional manufacturing processes. This may allow future scaling of devices to higher densities, producing cheaper and faster memories or microprocessors. Other applications include catalysis or filtration where surfaces are required with particular chemistry or porosity. The work will involve graduate and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary environment combining experiment and theory. Outreach will include the creation of online learning materials, summer projects for teachers and community college students, and public activities at the Cambridge Science Festival.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>Block copolymers microphase separate into periodic nanoscale structures, making them candidates for a range of applications including nanolithography and filtration. The great majority of work on thin film block copolymers has focused on diblock copolymers, but triblock terpolymers, which include three different blocks in a linear or star architecture, enable a much wider range of thin film morphologies including tiling patterns, square symmetry patterns, and structures with 90 degree bends. The proposed work will show how the morphologies of triblock terpolymer films can be controlled via interplay between the polymer composition and the processing conditions, and how specific morphologies can be templated using topographical substrate features, using coordinated experiments and theoretical investigations using self consistent field theory. The combination of triblock terpolymer volume fractions, molecular architecture, interaction parameters, film thickness, and solvent annealing with template geometry and substrate surface chemistry provides a rich parameter space within which an understanding of the kinetics and thermodynamics of microphase separation as well as the formation of technologically useful structures can be accomplished. The broader impacts of this work originate from the transformative potential of triblock terpolymers to produce nanoscale patterns relevant to nanolithography and nanomanufacturing, both in the microelectronics industry and in fields where a chemically heterogeneous surface with specific geometry is required. The work will involve graduate and undergraduate students in an interdisciplinary environment combining experiment and theory.

This project will use experiments to determine whether local communities or species from large regional areas explain the number and kinds of fungi associated with plants and their roots. Because these fungi are ubiquitous, they are globally important drivers of nutrient cycling and ecosystem productivity.  The scientific workforce will be strengthened through support for the education and training of a doctoral student and participation of undergraduates from underrepresented groups.

High-throughput molecular methods will be used in combination with physical measurements and analytical chemistry to assess the realized local symbiont community composition within roots. Three hypotheses will be tested: (1) older or more environmentally heterogeneous regions will result in greater functional diversity in the regional species pool; (2) species pools from older or more environmentally heterogeneous regions will result in greater realized local diversity relative to the size of the regional species pool; (3) the richness and functional diversity of the regional species pool will be the primary driver of symbiotic function, measured as the host plant's biomass and nutrient accumulation. The geologic age and environmental heterogeneity of a region will be linked to local community assembly and function via the composition of the regional species pool."

Current EIDs like Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (MERS) and antibiotic-resistant superbugs have the potential to make devastating impacts on public health. The methodologies under development in this project can be used to translate real-time data on EIDs into recommendations about where, when, and to whom to apply interventions so as to minimize negative impacts of the disease while reducing overall resource consumption. Furthermore, these recommendations are designed to be immediately interpretable in a subject matter context, thereby empowering decision makers to incorporate information from complex and heterogeneous data streams into disease management. Application of these methodologies has the potential to reduce mortality and morbidity at lower cost than existing management plans. Furthermore, models underpinning intervention recommendations will generate new knowledge about EID dynamics. <br/><br/>This research project aims to make fundamental contributions to online sequential decision making and to create a new statistical framework for data-driven management of EIDs. We conceptualize the EID as spreading across a finite set of locations, which might be physical locations in space or nodes in a network. An allocation strategy formalizes management of an EID and is represented by a sequence of functions, one per intervention decision, that map up-to-date information on an EID to a subset of locations recommended for treatment. An optimal allocation strategy maximizes some mean utility function over the duration of the EID. Construction of an optimal allocation strategy from data on an EID is challenging because: (i) the number of allocations is exponential in the number of locations; (ii) estimation and management must occur simultaneously; (iii) spatial proximity induces causal interference; and (iv) an allocation strategy must be interpretable to subject matter experts. We integrate ideas from statistics, computer science, optimization, and disease ecology to overcome these challenges. We combine simulation-optimization with policy-search algorithms to construct an online estimator of the optimal allocation strategy; this strategy trades off exploring allocation choices that improve estimates of disease dynamics with exploiting current estimated dynamics to immediately slow spread of the EID. We show that the treatment allocation problem can be recast as an infinite-dimensional bandit problem. We leverage this connection to derive estimation algorithms that scale to very large allocation problems and are amenable to theoretical study. We combine our policy-search and bandit-based estimators with a novel class of allocation strategies that can be expressed as a sequence of if-then statements that are immediately interpretable to subject-matter experts and can be readily adjusted based on expert judgment. We derive a non-parametric lower bound on the approximation error of an estimated allocation strategy within this class; this bound is used to perform goodness-of-fit tests for the estimated optimal allocation strategy."

As the 50-year-old Moore's law is approaching its limits, scientists are now turning to light as the information carrier. Unfortunately, our ability to control light in nanoscopic volumes is in many ways in its infancy, compared with how we can manipulate electrons. A new class of optical materials known as photonic crystals may hold the key to continued progress towards all-optical integrated circuits. However, traditional nanomanufacturing technologies for producing photonic crystals with three-dimensionally ordered nanostructures suffer from low throughput, small sample areas, and high cost. By integrating a simple, fast, and inexpensive colloidal self-assembly methodology with a new type of shape memory polymer, this project will explore a novel scalable nanomanufacturing approach for wafer-scale production of photonic crystals with reconfigurable optical properties. This interdisciplinary research will be closely integrated into curriculum development, new demonstration module design, and training of underrepresented high school and undergraduate students through a few successful programs at the university.  <br/><br/>Although various colloidal self-assembly technologies have been developed, most of these bottom-up approaches are only favorable for low volume, laboratory-scale production of photonic crystals. Moreover, self-assembled photonic crystals with fixed microstructures are only appropriate for fabricating passive nanooptical devices. Smart shape memory polymers that can memorize and recover their permanent shapes from structurally stable temporary sates are promising for developing active photonic crystal devices. Unfortunately, most of the existing shape memory polymers are thermoresponsive, and they suffer from heat-demanding shape memory cycles. The research team aims to conduct simultaneous experimental and theoretical investigations to address the key scientific and engineering barriers faced by the current colloidal self-assembly and shape memory polymer technologies. In-situ nanoscopic mechanical and mechanochromic tests, along with multiphysics mechanical finite element analysis simulations will facilitate the basic understanding of the unusual shape recovery mechanisms of the new type of shape memory polymer that enables unconventional all-room-temperature shape memory cycles. The stimuli-responsive microstructure-optical property relationship of the self-assembled photonic crystals will be elucidated by optical characterization and finite element optical simulations. Large-area macroporous polymer photonic crystals with optimal crystal structures and multiple memorizable optical states will be fabricated by the scalable bottom-up nanomanufacturing technology."

The research focuses on the feeding interactions between plants and caterpillars, and between caterpillars and their predators. By documenting ""who eats whom"" in Northern California soils of low versus high fertility, this project will be able to describe complex food webs and ask how these webs are different across soil types. Because most of our understanding of this topic comes from agricultural ecosystems that have soils impacted by fertilizer, this project will provide new insights as it is based on soils that naturally vary in fertility. This research will involve several undergraduate students and an ecology club.  <br/><br/>Variation in soil resources is a ubiquitous form of environmental heterogeneity, with strong direct and indirect effects on organismal traits and species interactions. Multiple theories address the effects of resource level on trophic interactions: the Resource Availability Hypothesis (RAH) suggests that resource availability should shape plant traits and, consequently, their quality to herbivores; in turn, the Slow Growth, High Mortality (SGHM) and High Performance, High Mortality Hypotheses (HPHM) relate plant quality to interactions between herbivores and natural enemies. Based on these theories, this research will disentangle the interacting roles of predation and nutritive and defensive plant traits in shaping plant-caterpillar-top predator tri-trophic interactions. Using a natural mosaic of low fertility serpentine and higher fertility non-serpentine soils in California, this project will build exclusion cages to assess how top-predators affect plant-caterpillar interactions across different soil types. Plant nutritive and defensive traits will be measured simultaneously to disentangle the relative importance of traits and predation in driving food web structure across different resource contexts. Together, these experiments will advance our understanding of how and why species interactions vary across heterogeneous landscapes."

This fundamental process plays a significant role in cosmology, and its study complements current efforts to discover new physics. Two laboratory techniques exist to determine the lifetime of a neutron with high precision, but they disagree significantly in their reported values. This discrepancy must be addressed in order to realize the potential of these techniques to help probe new physics. The research conducted with this award directly supports that effort by examining the behavior of very low energy (or ""ultracold"") neutrons which are magnetically confined in order to determine the neutron lifetime. The research involves a broad set of ideas and skills appropriate for undergraduate involvement and will be used to form the kernel for an interdisciplinary undergraduate research training, mentoring, and outreach program at Tennessee Technological University. <br/><br/>Research activities will be carried out in conjunction with the UCNtau collaboration, which has constructed a magneto-gravitational ultracold neutron trap with a long intrinsic neutron storage time and demonstrated a detection strategy capable of making multiple high-precision measurements in a single accelerator cycle at the Los Alamos National Laboratory ultracold neutron source. Losses due to spin evolution in this trap will be empirically characterized by developing a high-fidelity spin-tracking Monte Carlo simulation of the experiment which, when combined with measurements of the mean trap lifetime as a function of the polarization-preserving ambient magnetic field magnitude, will be used to characterize indirectly the loss rate associated with spin evolution in the trap, sufficient for completing measurement of the neutron lifetime to an accuracy of one second. Measurements in a dedicated test cell will provide information necessary to assess directly the effect of spin evolution in a very high-precision (well below 0.1%) magnetic trap measurement of the free neutron lifetime."

Zooplankton play a critical role in freshwater ecosystems; they feed on phytoplankton, the base of the food web, and are in turn consumed by fish. Consequently, changes in zooplankton populations have the potential to drastically alter water quality and food webs. Zooplankton in freshwater ecosystems around the world exhibit diel vertical migration, in which they migrate to the bottom waters of a lake or reservoir during the day to escape visual predation by fish and damaging ultraviolet (UV) radiation. At night, many zooplankton migrate to the water's surface to feed on phytoplankton when the risk of predation and UV exposure is lower. However, human activities are resulting in decreased DO concentrations in the bottom waters of waterbodies globally. As a result of decreased DO, zooplankton may remain in the surface waters during the day and no longer vertically migrate, resulting in decreased abundance and changes in the species composition. This research will be conducted in partnership with a local water utility, and all data and results will be shared with managers to inform their water quality decisions. The project will involve training of at least two undergraduate researchers in freshwater science laboratory and field methods in an interdisciplinary setting. In addition, results from this research will provide the basis for creating interactive and hands-on educational activities for school children at a nature center.<br/><br/>This project will integrate a unique whole-ecosystem manipulation of bottom water (hypolimnetic) DO concentrations, a cross-ecosystem survey of reservoirs on a hypolimnetic DO gradient, high-frequency sonar to observe the diel vertical distribution of zooplankton, and experimental analyses of zooplankton functional traits to examine how changes in DO concentrations alter zooplankton species composition, abundance, and behavior. Biweekly summer field surveys will be conducted across five reservoirs that exhibit a range of hypolimnetic DO concentrations. One of the reservoirs has a hypolimnetic oxygenation system that will be experimentally turned on and off (thereby controlling DO concentrations at the whole-ecosystem scale) to directly assess the effects of DO on zooplankton populations. Multiple diel sampling campaigns will also be conducted that use sonar acoustic technology to observe the vertical distribution of zooplankton in the water column. Taken together, these integrated research approaches will mechanistically determine the effects of changing DO concentrations on zooplankton communities and resulting implications for water quality in lakes and reservoirs."

As the type example of ocean-continent subduction-generated high topography, the Central Andes are critical to evaluating geodynamic models of orogenesis. Although previous studies of the structural history, past elevations, and incision record have provided important insights on surface uplift, these studies also suggest a disparate range of uplift histories and associated tectonic drivers. Current geodynamic models for Andean orogenesis include: (1) continuous late Cenozoic crustal thickening and shortening, resulting in gradual surface uplift and canyon incision; (2) late Cenozoic delamination of South American lithosphere, resulting in rapid surface uplift and a late Miocene pulse of incision; and (3) early Cenozoic contraction-driven crustal thickening, resulting in near modern elevations in the west by late Eocene and propagating deformation eastward through the Cenozoic. To distinguish between models, this project uses: (1) stable isotope analyses of volcanic glasses and soil carbonates to provide quantitative estimates of paleoelevations over time, coupled with geochronology to constrain timing; (2) isotope-enabled general circulation modeling to determine how changing elevations affected climate and to quantitatively interpret stable isotope data, constrained by modern elevation-isotope and climate-isotope relationships; (3) data-validated fluvial erosion modeling to predict the erosional response to different models; and (4) fluvial and lacustrine sedimentology and sediment provenance to identify changes in drainage system extent and basin development. By synthesizing these data, the research team will quantify surface topography and erosion during orogenic evolution and distinguish between proposed tectonic and climatic controls."

Ecological differences along environmental gradients can drive divergence among populations. This project will identify the genes responsible for genetic divergence of trait values among populations of Anthony?s poison arrow frog, Epipedobates anthonyi, which occurs along multiple mountainsides and elevation gradients in Ecuador. The researchers will test for natural selection on genes and relate that selection to environmental factors so as to determine which are responsible for the observed divergence. The results will contribute to our understanding of why tropical systems are so diverse and help predict evolutionary responses to climate change. In addition, the project includes the training of undergraduates, educational workshops, and K-12 outreach activities. <br/><br/>This project takes advantage of a unique study system to investigate the drivers and mechanisms that promote population divergence in the absence of geographic isolation. Populations of Epipedobates anthonyi show phenotypic divergence along elevation gradients in putatively adaptive traits including size, coloration, male advertisement calls, and thermal tolerance. Despite this phenotypic divergence, analyses of neutral genetic variation indicate that these populations are not isolated. Using genomic approaches, the researchers will examine signatures of divergent selection across the genome, correlate environmental variation with the observed divergence, and detect genetic changes likely responsible for observed phenotypic variation across elevation gradients. Tissue samples have been collected from 35 populations that encompass the distribution of this species across four replicated elevational gradients. This highly integrative project will provide an in-depth analysis of the relative roles of adaptive genetic differentiation and phenotypic plasticity on observed patterns of phenotypic divergence in natural populations."

Understanding the genomic effects of inbreeding will help elucidate the plight of small populations undergoing intense selection.

Genomic analysis will reveal the genetic machinery that has impaired their response to selection.  These genomic findings will then be compared to genomic studies of fruit fly populations maintained at much larger population sizes.

A class of materials known as transition metal borides are more easily processed making them viable alternatives; however, they contain expensive and exceedingly scarce metals. This award supports the fundamental research necessary to discover new, low-cost synthetic processes for novel superhard, wear resistant materials that incorporate earth-abundant elements. Achieving these research goals will require the integration of materials engineering, chemistry, computational physics, and data mining. This coordinated approach will not only lead to higher performance materials but it also has the potential to transform many manufacturing processes by replacing current systems with sustainable, cost-effective alternatives. Further, this award will be used to teach undergraduate and graduate students how to address materials design problems through a multi-disciplinary, holistic picture that includes both performance and resource considerations. Teaching the next generation of STEM students how fundamental chemical research can lead to applied materials engineering is essential for global competitiveness.<br/> <br/>The development of earth-abundant, superhard materials will employ informatics and computation to screen ternary intermetallic boride and carbide phase space.

The impacts are far-reaching: from energy-harvesting devices, biomedical implants, corrosion-resistant coatings, and extending to any innovation with surfaces that is influenced by wettability in aqueous environments.  The goal of this project is to understand how polymer surfaces restructure themselves on a molecular level after coming in contact with water. Polymers are widely used as adhesives and lubricants and the knowledge of how these materials interact with water is of great importance. This understanding will be obtained using advanced specialized surface and spectroscopic techniques, some developed in the PI's laboratory.  The fundamental understanding developed by the planned research will help in designing better materials that either adapt or resist changes upon contact with water. The PI will be training two graduate students in the area of surface science, which is a key requirement of industries developing or manufacturing adhesives or coatings. In addition to these directly integrated educational aspects, the PI will also be involved in broader outreach activities to middle and high school students as well as to community colleges. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>It is well accepted that when we bring water in contact with surfaces, polar groups can migrate or reorient at the contact interface and reduce the interfacial energy. This surface rearrangement results in contact angle hysteresis. For example, when two solid surfaces come in contact, this interfacial rearrangement leads to adhesion hysteresis and higher friction. But the direct observations of these structural rearrangements are elusive. Surface-sensitive sum frequency generation spectroscopy (SFG) has been used to study surface rearrangements upon contact with water, changes during solid-solid contact, and during sliding contact. However, the kinetics of the surface rearrangements in contact with water are not well understood, particularly how dynamical effects are related to the Tg of the polymer or even surface Tg.  The PI will conduct SFG experiments to study the kinetics of surface rearrangements for poly(alkyl methacrylates) and poly(alpha-hydroxymethyl substituted acrylate) as a function of time and temperature after bringing the surfaces in contact with water, humidity, and steam. This will allow the PI to relate these surface changes with contact-angle hysteresis and adhesion hysteresis underwater, and to study the differences between wet and dry friction coefficients. Recently, the PI and his collaborators have shown that molecular dynamics (MD) simulations are able to reproduce the SFG spectra of the poly(methyl methacrylate) surface. Here, the PI will complement the SFG experiments with MD simulations for polymer-water interfaces. The proposed research will be a concerted effort at the molecular-level to understand the interaction of water with polymer surfaces."

This goal will be accomplished by measuring the rate at which lineages transition from outcrossing to self-fertilizing in the mustard family, a diverse and agriculturally important group. Flowering plants display an incredible breadth of variation in flower size, shape, and color that is generally attributed to the co-evolution of flowering plants and pollinators. Considering the potentially important role of cross-pollination in evolution, it is surprising that the shift to self-fertilization is one of the most common evolutionary transitions in flowering plants. Despite decades of work on this subject, it is still not clear what drives the initial spread of selfing and tests of the leading hypotheses explaining this pattern are rare. One reason for this is that a series of rapid changes in other floral traits occur in response to selfing, which then act to obscure traditional methods of comparative inference. Additionally, the project will result in the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>In flowering plants, shifts from outcrossing to selfing and from diploidy to polyploidy are common and are thought to occur in concert An association between selfing and polyploidy can occur through three non-mutually exclusive pathways. First, polyploidization could act as a filter, limiting the founding of new populations to those that originate from a self-compatible progenitor. Second, polyploidization could provide strong reproductive assurance resulting in the joint transition of mating system and ploidy. Finally, polyploidization could create a favorable environment for the spread of selfing after the population is established. This research estimates the transition rates of these three pathways in the Brassicaceae by assembling a database of mating system and ploidy data and extending a multi-state comparative model. These estimates will be used to evaluate the relative importance of reproductive assurance in the spread of selfing in neopolyploids.  The model will show why simultaneous transitions to selfing and polyploidy are relatively rare in Brassicaceae and other families with sporophytic self-incompatibility (SI). The theoretical framework will be extended to explain why such SI systems can survive extreme population bottlenecks associated with polyploidy and island colonization."

Given their importance, it is critical that we develop an understanding of how insect pollinator communities interact with plants across complex landscapes that are often heavily modified by humans. Researchers have recently begun using ""network"" approaches to study plant-pollinator interactions across entire ecological communities. A plant-pollinator network can be visualized as a ""web"" of all interactions between pollinators and plants at a given place. By building and evaluating plant-pollinator networks, researchers can, for example, assess whether pollination at a given site will remain stable in the face of disturbance or loss of species. This is especially relevant, considering that human-induced stressors, such as habitat loss and pesticide use, are causing pollinator declines worldwide. This research will use a new genetic approach to determine which plant species are pollinated by which bee species in ten Kansas prairies. Data will be used to construct plant-pollinator networks to assess the potential effect of disturbance and loss of pollinator species on pollination services across human-modified landscapes.  As part of this project, the research team will conduct pollinator ecology workshops for middle- and high school students aspiring to be first-generation college graduates.  <br/><br/>Plant-pollinator networks are typically constructed from observations of insects landing on flowers (i.e., ""visitation networks""). Few researchers have evaluated these insects for the presence and species identities of pollen carried between flowers; doing so based on pollen morphology is especially time-consuming. In this project, investigators will use metabarcoding to identify pollen carried by native bees collected across ten study sites. Several structural properties of the resulting pollen transport networks will be compared to the properties of networks based on visitation data alone. Investigators predict that: A) pollen transport networks will exhibit greater network-level specialization than visitation networks, and B) pollen transport networks will be less nested than visitation networks, indicating that plant-pollinator interactions could be more susceptible to species loss than the visitation data, alone, would suggest."

Examples include the evolution of endothermy (warm-bloodedness) and elevated metabolism in archosaurs (birds and their close relatives, ~12,000 species) and mammals (~5,000 species). High metabolic rates are thought to be a key component of mammalian and archosaur species radiations, by allowing individuals to exploit a wider range of environmental and temporal niches (lifestyles). For their body size, extant birds have some of the highest growth rates and metabolisms of any vertebrates. High avian metabolic rates are also associated with highly canalized development, as seen in the relative lack of body size variation for individuals of a given age. The primary aim of this research is to understand how these extreme physiological and developmental specializations arose within the dinosaur ancestors of birds. This project will produce two major broader impacts. First, data and interpretations generated by this project will be incorporated into updates to an exhibit currently in development at the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH), ?Dinosaurs Among Us.? This exhibit is a multi-media showcase of the various lines of evidence supporting the hypothesis that birds evolved from non-avian dinosaurs. It uses fossil specimens, models, graphics, and interactives to reveal the latest findings about the dinosaurian origins of many typically avian traits. The PIs are actively involved in consulting on the scientific content of the exhibit, which, together with associated museum events and an extensive online presence, will reach a large portion of the 5 million annual visitors to AMNH and many others globally. Educational materials from the exhibit will reach a diverse group of students, many from underserved communities in New York City. Second, this project greatly enhances the infrastructure of the AMNH paleontology laboratory to conduct histological research on fossil tissues. Training in histological techniques will enable the PIs to further train AMNH staff and students, developing the human resources of the laboratory to support projects involving histological analysis for years to come.<br/><br/>	Calculation of dinosaur growth rates (a proxy for metabolism) from their bone microstructure has demonstrated that the transition to modern avian endothermy did not occur in a single step. The earliest birds, for example, grew more rapidly than non-avian reptiles, but more slowly than their extant descendants. However, the origin of elevated metabolic rates among the earliest theropod dinosaur ancestors of birds remains unknown. This project seeks to fill this gap in knowledge, by using bone histology (examination of the microscopic organization of bone tissue) and gross morphology to measure growth rate and ontogenetic canalization for a phylogenetically basal theropod dinosaur, Coelophysis bauri.  As it is one of the only extinct dinosaurs with a large sample size (hundreds of specimens) available from single populations, histological sectioning and growth curve construction for Coelophysis bauri will shed light on the metabolic condition of some of the earliest diverging theropod dinosaurs, and provide a framework within which the transition to rapid growth rates and developmental canalization among bird-line archosaurs may be assessed."

The potential degradation of the matrix polymer and the interface will be measured and the test data will be used to calibrate models for such degradation. Polymer matrix composite materials are used in structural applications exposed to water. As polymer matrix composite materials are gaining wide acceptance for several important structures, there has been concern about possible degradation of the performance from exposure to moisture in the form of humid air. Less considered is the influence of direct contact of the composite with liquid water.  Such exposure under the presence of voids in the composite may allow water transport in the form of capillary flow. Capillary flow represents a very rapid mechanism of transport which will elevate diffusion into the polymer, and cause increased rate of degradation of the organic polymer and fiber/matrix interface. A substantial fraction of the US export and economy relies on the automotive, aircraft and ship building industries, and results from this research will benefit the US economy and society. This research involves multiple disciplines such as microfluidics, materials science and solid mechanics.  The multi-scale approach outlined will involve students from underrepresented groups in science and engineering, and is expected to impact the engineering education program in a very positive manner.<br/><br/>Voids and porosity are detrimental structural imperfections in polymer matrix composite materials, not only due to strength reduction, but they provide extra paths for water absorption and filling beyond moisture diffusion in matrix. This project specifically addresses the fundamental problems of the interferences between structural defects, moisture uptake, and mechanical strength and fracture mechanisms of underwater composite materials. Specific objectives are: (1) quantify structural defects in composite materials using scanning electron microscope and micro-computed tomography methods, establish a reliable water uptake model and validate with microfluidics testing; (2) characterize the fiber/matrix interface strength of dry and water-aged composite materials, using in situ scanning electron microscopy on miniature transverse single-fiber and composite tensile specimens; (3) establish a multiscale micromechanical model for prediction the strength of a macroscopic composite exposed to water aging. Predictions will be compared to and validated by the experimental measurements for water-aged glass/vinylester and glass/epoxy composites."

The project integrates fundamental research with collaborative assistance from an industrial partner to generate nanoscale features (of order 1/1000th the width of a human hair) that have potential to be translated from the laboratory-scale to a widely available and useable platform.  In undertaking this collaborative approach, the research team will use commercially-relevant polymers that are created to spontaneously form ultra-small features, whose shape and function can be dictated through processing conditions.  By linking aspects of materials chemistry, materials properties, and processing, this project will aid in the cost-effective evaluation of polymer systems to generated efficient electronic devices.  This project provides research opportunities to students (including underrepresented undergraduate and economically-disadvantaged high school students) in a vibrant and collaborative laboratory setting and exposes students of all levels to cutting-edge concepts for making new nanometer scale materials that could lead to lower cost and more energy-efficient fabrication of computer-related devices.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The PI and his industrial partner at DuPont collaborate to develop new nanotemplates from self-assembling macromolecules using commercially-relevant block copolymers.  A particular goal of this work is to investigate star architectures (and variable block chemistries) in block copolymers as a viable means for generating ""writeable"" and oriented nanostructures with reduced feature sizes for nanotemplating applications.  By accomplishing this goal, the University of Delaware and DuPont team will address key needs in the arena of nanotemplating and bit-patterned media, including the ability to rapidly generate thin film templates with well-defined features at low cost, with appropriate and addressable orientations and domains, with minimal defects, and approaching smaller feature sizes (< 5 nm).  To facilitate general understanding, the proposed activities combine 1) the examination of various block copolymer architectures and chemistries, 2) the development of a unique solvent vapor annealing approach (raster solvent vapor annealing with soft shear), and 3) the macromolecular design, synthesis, self-assembly, and characterization expertise of the University of Delaware and the nanoprocessing and materials expertise of DuPont.  Specific research themes include:  (1) investigating the differences between star and linear block copolymer directed self-assembly using both moderately-repulsive and highly-repulsive polymer-polymer interactions to reduce feature sizes, improve nanostructure ordering, and control nanostructure orientation; (2) utilizing a newly-developed directed and programmable solvent annealing process to directionally align nanostructures with minimal defects; (3) probing solvent partitioning between domains via neutron scattering techniques; (4) incorporating newly-proposed ""flexible-blade"" flow coating to simultaneously cast and align nanostructures."

Examples include lighter but tougher materials, materials free from additives that can cause health or environmental hazards over time, or materials with simplified compositions but superior mechanical performance. Professor Jeffery White and his research group, in collaboration with Chevron Phillips Chemical Company, seek to discover how to control the creation of useful new polymeric materials, made from very simple components, with final properties that can be tailored to fit a wide range of applications even when the chemical composition of the material remains fixed.  These new types of polymer materials are called tapered copolymers, and the spatial arrangement of the individual chemical components within the large molecule structure has the potential to impart variable, but controllable, physical properties through the creation of unique nanometer length-scale interfaces.  By choosing which two types of polymer starting materials are used to make the molecule and their order of arrangement within the molecular structure, different final physical properties can be achieved, including soft versus hard, low versus high temperature stability, and tough versus brittle.  Due to the special aspects of this collaboration between university and industrial scientists within the State of Oklahoma, students from all levels will have the opportunity to participate in research, and observe differences in the practice of science and technology in academic and industrial environments.  Further, the proposed schemes for making new materials may be suitable for eliminating the necessary addition of toxic additives that have caused problems in earlier materials, thus creating new opportunities for use in medical applications.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Recent advances in controlled living polymerization techniques have led to the design of many new polymeric materials. An exciting subset of the new materials afforded by these advances includes copolymers whose comonomer ordering varies in some systematic manner across the length of individual chains.  One method, called tapered copolymer synthesis, offers significant promise for interfacial morphology control in copolymers. In a previous project, the PI demonstrated that different interfacial types in tapered copolymers significantly impacted molecular and some physical properties in styrene-butadiene copolymers, even when the comonomer composition was essentially held fixed. Using the experimental approaches developed during an extensive history of characterizing complex amorphous polymer systems, the PI in collaboration with the GOALI partner co-PI Dr. Joe Zhou of Chevron Phillips, will investigate the degree to which controlled nanoscale interfaces can be created in tapered copolymers, and the impact of those interfaces on final macroscopic properties.  An extensive array of tapered and inverse-tapered copolymer materials will be prepared by the co-PI using a pilot-scale anionic polymerization reactor, which enhances the probability that the conclusions reached through the program can have practical implications for large-scale materials synthesis and applications.  The PI's expertise in understanding complex macromolecular blends and composites using advanced characterization methods will be used to develop widely-applicable structure/synthesis/property relationships in the area of gradient and tapered copolymers, the impact of which should extend far beyond styrene-butadiene copolymers."

Determining the underlying population structure upon which to place these local adaptations is a central objective in evolutionary biology. However, the impact of evolutionary history on inference of contemporary population structure has been largely unexplored. This research aims to examine the effects of evolutionary history on genetic and morphological variation among populations at regional and continental scales. Empirical data and the results from this study will serve as a model for teaching evolution, specifically genetic drift, in both academic and public settings. <br/><br/>Extensive phenotypic variation between widespread organisms often complicates determination of taxonomic relationships. The range of the common garter snake Thamnophis sirtalis spans all of North America, excluding Mexico and the desert southwest. Twelve T. sirtalis subspecies are currently recognized and defined by color patterning. One of these subspecies, T.s. pickeringii, co-occurs with two less widely distributed congeners (T. elegans and T. ordinoides) in the Pacific Northwest across the San Juan Archipelago. This region was subject to multiple Pleistocene glaciation events up until ~20,000 years ago, after which flora and fauna recolonized the islands from neighboring mainland refugia. This project aims to investigate the relationship between evolutionary history and contemporary population variation by comparing simulated data of known demographic histories to genomic data from two empirical study systems: 1) the young San Juan Archipelago Thamnophis species assemblage, 2) a continental-scale sampling of all Thamnophis sirtalis subspecies. These two systems occur in proximity to multiple known Pleistocene refugia and across geographic barriers to gene flow for other North American flora and megafauna, but it is unclear whether a generalist ectotherm will show the patterns observed in previous phylogeographic studies. Using genomic data, this project will test whether 1) T. sirtalis subspecies designations (and therefore phenotypes) represent unique evolutionary lineages, 2) distinct evolutionary lineages within T. sirtalis occur along known or novel barriers to gene flow, or 3) the combined effects of historical vicariance and non-uniform selective forces across different subspecies produce a signal discordant with phenotypic variation."

Many of the responses in a cell are due to changes in what proteins are produced; cells turn on protein production, or turn it off, when a particular group of proteins, regulatory proteins, interact with the DNA. Regulatory proteins may act alone or in groups to turn genes on and off, and the timing and number of combinations in these binding events can be very complicated.  There are experiments that show where a specific protein attaches to the DNA, giving us clues that regulation might be occurring; with improving laboratory methods we are able to find the DNA binding locations (profiles) of more and more proteins very specifically. This research will develop special computational and statistical methods for analyzing all of this data together, so that we can see what combinations of proteins act together to regulate genes. From these results we will understand much more about how gene regulation is working in functioning cells. All products produced by this research will be made freely available and accessible to other researchers and the public. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained to use these bioinformatics research techniques, and strong efforts will be made to recruit students from under-represented groups. Interesting exercises will be created, based on the research methods and results, for undergraduate bioinformatics students and for students in workshops, as well as lessons suitable for high school students studying genetic regulation in their biology courses. <br/><br/>Current bioinformatics analysis techniques do not fully capture the structural information provided by the shape of read distributions produced in high-resolution genomic assays. For example, careful analysis of cross-linking patterns in collections of ChIP-exo datasets can potentially inform which proteins are interacting with one another in higher-order protein-DNA complexes. This project aims to develop a suite of shape-aware machine-learning tools for the analysis of high-resolution protein-DNA binding data that will: 1) deconvolve distinct genomic interaction modes from a single dataset; 2) detect and correct experimental artifacts and biases that arise in the new assays; 3) characterize the organization of higher-order protein-DNA complexes across multiple data types; and 4) detect changes in genomic event locations and interaction modes across multiple experimental conditions. This project will therefore enable integrative models of diverse protein-DNA complexes, directly impacting our understanding of gene regulation in a wide variety of organisms."

Hotspots can be sites of mid-plate volcanism such as Hawaii and Yellowstone or sites of excessive volcanism as seen along plate boundaries as in Iceland on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.  This project focuses on the Hawaiian hotspot, which has produced the Hawaiian-Emperor chain of volcanoes that extends 5800 kilometers from the youngest and currently active volcano Loihi, just southeast of the big island of Hawaii, through the Hawaiian Islands to the 80 million year old Meiji seamount near the Aleutian trench.  The Hawaiian chain, which is the younger part of the Hawaiian-Emperor chain, is oriented west-northwest from Loihi for a distance of 3500 km where it changes in orientation by almost 60° to the north-northwest and becomes the Emperor seamount chain. This change in orientation is called the Hawaiian-Emperor bend and is estimated to be about 50 million years old.  This project is aimed at understanding what causes this bend in the Hawaiian-Emperor chain.  The two basic hypotheses are (1) that the plume stood still and the Pacific plate changed its direction of motion relative to the plume 50 million years ago, or (2) that the plume moved rapidly southward during formation of the Emperor chain, but has moved little since 50 million years ago as the Hawaiian chain was formed.  To distinguish between these hypotheses the project will analyze existing magnetic field data collected by ship and aeromagnetic surveys to determine the direction of magnetization locked into the ocean crust and uppermost mantle of the plate during a time interval spanning the Hawaiian-Emperor bend. The time-averaged geomagnetic field varies predictably with latitude, so that ancient magnetization directions will provide the paleolatitude and paleo-orientation of the Pacific plate and the plume-related Hawaiian-Emperor volcanoes.  Understanding these fundamental processes will permit a better understanding of hazards posed by volcanoes and by earthquakes within the Pacific Ocean basin and the surrounding ""ring of fire"".  The proposed work will give valuable research experience and transferable quantitative skills to graduate and undergraduate students. The methods and results will be incorporated into university lectures.  The subject of hotspots and plate tectonics is popular with the broader public and the results will be disseminated as widely as possible.<br/><br/>Magnetic anomaly skewness data are an established source of reliable paleomagnetic poles.  In addition to existing marine magnetic data, this project will utilize Project MAGNET vector aeromagnetic data from low paleolatitudes to obtain poles with greater accuracy than alternative methods.  Reliable poles will be determined with compact confidence limits for chrons between 20r (44 Ma) and 26r (60 Ma), which bracket the Hawaiian-Emperor bend and a shift in the pole relative to Pacific hotspots of about 8°.  The project will determine when and how rapidly this shift occurred and evaluate how much is due to motion of the Hawaiian hotspot relative to a mantle reference frame and how much is due to true polar wander.  Particular attention will be paid to any accelerations in plate motion that are recorded in the time span from 65 Ma to 32 Ma which may provide evidence for or against a change in Pacific plate motion coincident with the Hawaiian-Emperor bend. The project will also complete the analysis of data from time periods 68 Ma, 79 Ma, and 81 Ma to better estimate Pacific plate and Hawaiian hotspot apparent polar wander during the formation of the northern Emperor chain."

Little is known about the factors that influence where microbes live, however, or how they work together to provide life's basic needs. This project will determine the importance of factors such as temperature, water, birth, death, and movement to the size, location, and composition of natural microbial communities. It focuses on microbes that cycle nitrogen, a nutrient that is critical for plant, animal, and human health across the globe. The project will advance the education and training of a doctoral student in modern scientific techniques and their application to natural communities. Results have the potential to improve agriculture and industrial output as well as human health. They will be translated to the general public through educational media and presentations at a California state park. The investigators will present their research to local communities through the Discovery Cube Science Center of Orange County, a non-profit organization with a goal to inspire citizens through science education. <br/><br/>This project will investigate the contribution of deterministic versus stochastic forces to variation in microbial community composition and function. Two hypotheses will be tested: 1) Stochastic variation of functional gene diversity will be lower than that of microbial taxonomic diversity and 2) Stochastic variation of functions carried out by fewer taxa (narrow functions such as nitrogen fixation) will be higher than stochastic variation of functions carried out by many taxa (broad functions such as ammonia assimilation). Deterministic variability derives from theoretically predictable factors such as precipitation or nutrient availability. In contrast, stochasticity affects diversity mainly through drift, which is in turn influenced by dispersal. This project will use bags filled with plant litter to replicate natural microbial communities. A crossed experimental design will manipulate a known, deterministic effect (ambient versus added precipitation) and dispersal (open versus closed to immigration). Metagenomes will be generated from three replicate samples per bag and for the initial inoculum. This genetic information about the microbial community will then be compared within and across treatments, looking both at taxonomic composition and functional genes, with a focus on the nitrogen cycle. Results will significantly advance current understanding of the primary factors affecting natural microbial communities."

While binary eutectics with non-faceted interfaces are relatively well understood, theories describing the structure and behavior of more complicated eutectics - those with three or more phases and/or with faceted interfaces - are not well developed. These complex eutectics have received renewed interest in recent years for their potential as in-situ composites and self-assembling metamaterials, but better control of microstructure development is needed to realize these advanced applications. A variety of carefully controlled experimental conditions will be used to investigate the behavior of selected ternary eutectic systems, both regular and irregular. State-of-the-art techniques for directional solidification, along with a novel method of equiaxed solidification, will be used to investigate the relationships between anisotropy, crystal mismatch, non-equilibrium pattern formation, alignment of interphase boundaries, prevailing orientation relationships, and the evolution of crystallographic texture.

Although frogs and toads use hearing to find a mate, many frogs and toads have lost their middle and outer ear structures. This project aims to discover the genetic changes that have resulted in the evolution of ear loss in toads. Since the middle and outer ears of other land animals (including humans) use similar developmental pathways, understanding the genetic changes that result in ear loss in toads will illuminate potential causes of middle and outer ear loss and malformation in other animals. The genetic data produced by this study will help us better understand the relationships between toad species and provide novel genetic data for future research. In addition to graduate training, interactive museum displays will be created from the specimens and data generated from the project, and a series of K-12 classroom exercises will be developed to explain the ear structure evolution in toads.<br/><br/>This project investigates the selection pressures and genetic constraints that generate convergent loss and potential regain of middle and outer ear structures across the family of true toads (Bufonidae). Sequence data for 60 bufonid species (16 earless, 44 eared) spanning seven ear loss events will be analyzed to identify signatures of selection and parallel genetic changes across 50 genes involved in middle and outer ear development. The dataset will assess the effects of various selection pressures and look for evidence of constraint at the genetic level, complementing the large amount of evidence for selection and constraint at the phenotypic level that has previously been collected by the research team. Results of this project will delineate the roles of selection and constraint in driving ear loss across Bufonidae, and elucidate common genetic pathways by which selection can act in a constrained, potentially costly, trait loss."

Although many individual invasive plants have been studied extensively, basic understanding of the biogeography of invasive plants as a broader group remains limited.  This research project will analyze and project the geographies of invasive plants in their non-native ranges within the continental U.S.  The investigators will compare the geographic traits of invasive species to those of non-native species that are established but are not known to be spreading or negatively affecting natural systems.  Project results will enhance fundamental knowledge of unique biogeographical patterns of invasive plants in their non-native range; knowledge that is critical for forecasting invasion risk.  The project will provide new insights regarding how geography influences the factors affecting the spread of new species into ecosystems in the invaded range, including identifying ""hot spots"" of future invasion risk.  The investigators will create spatially explicit invasion risk models for the nation to guide policy and management, and they will produce state-level ""watch lists"" of invasive plants likely to become problematic under potential future climate conditions.  The project also will contribute to improved education in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields through graduate training and expansion of undergraduate participation in research.<br/><br/>Invasive species have been identified as one of five prominent threats to global ecosystems by the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment.  Despite the prominence of the problem, there is a paucity of basic scientific understanding regarding what sets these species apart, especially why invasive species are invasive.  Considerable effort has gone into addressing this question through ecological studies, but relatively few researchers have focused on understanding the geography of invasive species.  Invasive plant research tends to be biased towards a handful of very well-studied species, which inhibits understand of invasion patterns more generally.  Furthermore, lumping invasive and established species together conflates the influence of human introduction with the influence of biology on the geographic distributions of invasions, thereby hindering identification of patterns characteristic of invasives.  This project will focus on evaluating the validity of answers to two core sets of questions:  (1) For non-native plants in the continental U.S., how does non-native range geography differ for plants that are established vs. those that are invasive? (2) What is the current geography of establishment and invasion risk across the U.S., and how might they shift with changing climatic conditions?  The investigators will use occurrence records for invasive plants compiled from museum and management records to model potential distribution for all 1,000 invasive plants under current and projected future climate conditions.  This analysis will enable creation of a spatially explicit model of ""hot spots"" of future invasion risk across the continental U.S."

This landscape diversity results in high, but poorly documented, levels of biodiversity in many groups, including amphibians and reptiles. This project will increase understanding of the diversity and evolution of Angola's amphibians and reptiles by analyzing species' distributions, abundances, genetics, and anatomy. Based on these data, undocumented species will be identified, characterized and formally described. Two major hypotheses will be tested: whether arid-adapted species of S.W. Angola are descended from East African ancestors that migrated during periods of dry climate, and whether species restricted to the Angolan highlands are ancient descendants of formerly widespread ancestors. Researchers will also test how climate factors affect the degree to which malaria-causing parasites specialize on particular lizard species. This project will also train students in field and laboratory methods, as well as data dissemination and analysis. Public outreach efforts will include development of short video documentaries and English- and Portuguese-language guides to Angola's amphibians and reptiles.<br/><br/>Surveys of the Angolan herpetofauna will be informed by current knowledge gained from the less than 8,000 specimens that currently exist in museums worldwide. A total of six expeditions throughout Angola will be undertaken over a period of three years, with each focusing on a region identified as poorly sampled based on the provenance of extant museum specimens or as key sampling areas for addressing taxonomic problems. Specimens obtained in survey efforts will be subjected to collection and analysis of ecological, genetic, and morphological data. Molecular systematic analyses of the genetic data will identify cryptic species and targeted high-throughput sequencing will be used to test biogeographic hypotheses. Morphological data collection will include external morphological examination as well as high-resolution CT scanning to identify diagnostic internal anatomical features of species under study. Ecological niche modeling of species' ranges will be used to explore patterns of faunal turnover and identify conservation priorities. All biodiversity data generated in the course of the project, including point localities, DNA sequences, and CT scans, will be made available to the broader scientific community.

Understanding the impact of warming on disease has gained special urgency due to climate change, but its net effect remains controversial and elusive. This study will explore how water temperature alters aquatic host-parasite interactions by testing whether shifts in growth and development could mismatch the life-cycles of a host and its parasite, a mechanism that is believed to be important in the climate change context, although direct tests of it are uncommon. This study constitutes a further step toward identifying which outcomes for disease are likely to dominate as the climate changes and will contribute to a framework for predicting effects of temperature on host-parasite interactions. The broader impacts of this work include 1) teaching K-12 students and the public about host-parasite interactions, 2) mentoring undergraduates, including under-represented groups, to do independent research and engage the public through outreach, and 3) developing the plot of an interactive children's book about the mayfly-parasite relationship. All of these efforts focus on small animals (e.g., parasites and invertebrates) to increase awareness of the full scope of biodiversity.<br/><br/>After measuring a suite of environmental variables in mountain streams (Colorado, USA), evidence suggests that warmer temperatures decrease the prevalence of nematode worms infecting mayflies. That observation, combined with previous findings that warmer temperatures accelerate the developmental rate of mayfly hosts, suggests that the mismatched timing of host and parasite life-cycles could decrease parasitism in warmer areas. Because temperature cannot be readily disentangled from other environmental variables in nature, a controlled microcosm experiment will be used to test the hypothesis that warmer water causes faster development of mayflies, thereby decreasing the overlap of susceptible (early instar) hosts with infective parasites, and ultimately reducing parasite infections."

A class of materials known as transition metal borides are more easily processed making them viable alternatives; however, they contain expensive and exceedingly scarce metals. This award supports the fundamental research necessary to discover new, low-cost synthetic processes for novel superhard, wear resistant materials that incorporate earth-abundant elements. Achieving these research goals will require the integration of materials engineering, chemistry, computational physics, and data mining. This coordinated approach will not only lead to higher performance materials but it also has the potential to transform many manufacturing processes by replacing current systems with sustainable, cost-effective alternatives. Further, this award will be used to teach undergraduate and graduate students how to address materials design problems through a multi-disciplinary, holistic picture that includes both performance and resource considerations. Teaching the next generation of STEM students how fundamental chemical research can lead to applied materials engineering is essential for global competitiveness.<br/> <br/>The development of earth-abundant, superhard materials will employ informatics and computation to screen ternary intermetallic boride and carbide phase space. In combination, this approach will guide the experimental identification of novel crystal structures with outstanding mechanical properties.

Additionally, novel mechanochemical experiments using in-situ nanoindentation coupled with IR spectroscopy, in conjunction with first principles electronic structure theory, will establish the fundamental mechanisms of mechanical deformation. These experiments will serve to validate the computationally screened compounds as well as reveal opportunities to optimize chemical bonding interactions further enhancing the mechanical response. The result will inform the future advancement of engineering materials by producing a methodological framework to understand the mechanics of disparate classes of complex inorganic solids."

In order to make these projections of future climate, scientists will need to understand how the world's smallest organisms, fungi and bacteria, respond to changing environmental conditions. These microbes play a critical role in the Earth's carbon cycle. They decompose dead plant material, releasing carbon dioxide back into the atmosphere. Current climate models assume that the rate of this release is determined by environmental conditions, such as temperature, moisture, or soil pH. Changes in these conditions are expected to ""turn the dial"" on microbial activity. If it gets warmer, microbes will release more carbon dioxide; if it gets colder, microbes will release less carbon dioxide. Yet this assumption ignores a key aspect of most microbes: they are highly skilled warriors. Fungi and bacteria release an astonishing number of chemicals and compounds intended to kill their fellow microbes and colonize their territory. This warfare, however, comes at a considerable cost. A microbe must choose between using its energy for combat or using its energy for growth. In the proposed work, the researchers will quantify how microbial combat affects decomposition rates across environmental conditions, helping to understand where and when microbially-driven carbon dioxide releases will respond unpredictably to changing environmental conditions. The investigators will also train a high school student and develop outreach activities with a natural history museum. <br/><br/>Building on previous diversity-function studies, the researchers will develop a generalizable model to disentangle the relative importance of antagonistic competition versus environmental conditions as drivers of microbial-mediated decomposition rates. Using baseline trait data collected on 44 wood-decay fungi, 100 unique communities will be selected with varying levels of combative ability, average stress-tolerance ability, and species richness (from 3 to 12 unique species). The communities will be assembled in realistic microcosms and incubated under both optimal conditions (warm and wet) and stressful conditions (cold and dry). Total wood decomposition will be measured after 12 weeks. This study will allow the researchers to address three main questions: (1) Does community-level decomposition differ from what is predicted using the microbes' individual decomposition rates? (2) Do these differences depend on whether the individuals are combative fungi or stress-tolerant fungi? and (3) Does the relative importance of antagonistic interactions differ between stressful and optimal environmental conditions? The answers to these questions will ultimately help restructure existing climate models and better project how global carbon dioxide fluxes will change over time."

It formulates a model that is suitable to address large-scale network optimization problems. First, the project formulates stochastic link models that are consistent with the kinematic wave model. Two types of models are formulated: (i) models with a complexity that is linear in the link?s space capacity, (ii) models with a complexity that is independent of the link?s space capacity. This is achieved through a combination of ideas from the fields of traffic flow theory, queueing network theory, transient queueing theory, and more generally operations research. Second, the project formulates a network decomposition approach that enables the link models to be used for large-scale network analysis. Third, this project plans a technique to approximate the joint network distribution of a given performance measure based on lower-dimensional subnetwork distributions. The case studies of this project contribute to the modeling of between-link dependency structures, as well as to their use to mitigate congestion for large-scale networks."

This project will investigate some of the least understood aspects this globally important process: what causes it to start, what kind of crust is produced after subduction starts, and what materials are released from the subducting slab as it initially sinks. The International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 352 drilled 1.22 kilometers of volcanic rocks at water depths of 3.1-4.8 kilometers in the Bonin fore-arc in the western Pacific Ocean to investigate the start of subduction. This research performs a complete geochemical and petrological characterization of drilled fore-arc, seafloor, mafic, volcanic rocks, (i.e., basalts and boninites) recovered during the drilling expedition to better understand how subduction zone volcanism begins and evolves. The rock sequences encountered in the Bonin fore-arc are remarkably similar to those found in many ophiolites (ocean crust and upper mantle rocks found on the continents), so this project will also provide insights into the origin of ophiolites as well. This project supports and expands the extensive international scientific collaborations developed during Expedition 352 to include additional top-flight female scientists as well as undergraduate and graduate researchers.  Results from this project will become part of classroom resources supported by an ongoing NSF-funded education project.  It will also provide funding to researchers at institutions in three EPSCoR states (Iowa, Utah, and Rhode Island) and foster international collaboration with Australian scientists.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to document the nature of the first crust produced after subduction initiation in the Izu-Bonin-Mariana arc system. Samples collected from four sites drilled during the International Ocean Discovery Program Expedition 352 to the Bonin fore-arc will be analyzed. Drill cores from two of the sites primarily recovered fore-arc basalts and two recovered boninites.  This research, in collaboration with that being done by other members of the shipboard scientific party, will comprehensively analyze the recovered volcanic rocks, providing geochemical data on the major and trace element compositions of volcanic glasses. It will also complete analyses of oxygen isotopes, water and CO2 concentrations in the volcanic glasses; measurements of water concentrations in pyroxenes; Fe ratios in glasses; concentrations of fluid-mobile elements and B-Li isotopes in whole rocks and glasses; radiogenic Re-Os isotopes and PGE abundances in whole rocks and glasses; and major element and trace element compositions of whole rocks. Resulting data will be used to constrain melting processes and understand variations in the fluid, solid, and magma fluxes through the nascent mantle wedge from subduction initiation onward as the mode of magma generation changes from decompression melting to flux melting. The data will be used to address four principle scientific questions: (1) are fore arc basalts generated by decompression melting in a unique high temperature, low-pressure environment during rapid sea-floor spreading related to subduction initiation; (2) are the mantle sources of fore arc basalts and boninites unusually depleted and do they exhibit signatures of ancient recycled mantle or continental components; (3) were low- and high-Si boninites from drilling Sites U1439 and U1442 generated in succession from depleted mantle left after generation of fore arc basalts as spreading rates decreased and the involvement of subducted fluids increased; and (4) did magma generation migrate landward with time and to lower pressures. These questions align with the principal objectives of the NSF-funded International Ocean Discovery Program's Initial Science Plan, including testing the validity of the ophiolite model and understanding the initial origins of continental crust. Additionally the work will address questions in the NSF-funded GeoPRISMS science plan that focus on what the physical and chemical conditions are that control subduction zone initiation and the early development of arc systems."

As a consequence, characterizing the arrangement and order of polymers at nanometer length scales is crucial for the continued development of new materials.  Much progress in this area is due to the application of advanced microscopy techniques (transmission electron microscopy) to complex polymeric systems in order to resolve the structure at  very high resolutions.  New developments in electron microscopy instrumentation are pushing the limits of what is possible, but these advances have not been tailored for the microscopy of polymers, which are very sensitive to electron beams and undergo rapid damage.  This project will develop electron microscopy tools to image the structure of electrically conducting polymers used in a variety of emerging electronic applications, such as transistors and solar cell devices.  By demonstrating new approaches for resolving the morphology with sub-nanometer resolution, this research will advance the fundamental science of how the chemical composition of polymers leads to the microstructure and aid in the development of polymers for flexible electronics applications.  Furthermore, integrated educational and research activities will also include recruitment and retention of students from underrepresented groups.  The investigators involved in this project will further support diversity in engineering education by offering mentorship and research experiences to undergraduate students.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project will develop advanced electron microscopy tools for the study of polymeric materials.  New methods to generate contrast in the electron microscope are warranted because of the complexity of the microstructure of conjugated polymer systems.  The proposed work begins by examining radiation damage in the transmission electron microscope using two observables: diffraction intensities and low-loss electron energy-loss spectroscopy.  These measurements will guide further experiments and establish limits of imaging modalities.  Low-loss energy-filtered transmission electron microscopy will generate high-resolution images of long-range order in conjugated polymers.  Phase plates will enhance contrast in both bright-field and focused-probe modes to enable imaging of polymer/fullerene mixtures, polymer blends, and block copolymers used in photovoltaics.  Furthermore, charge transport heterogeneity will be examined using low-loss spectrum imaging to see deviations in density of states under bias, and by imaging local variations in electric fields that result from charge heterogeneity using a phase plate.  Overall, this proposal will demonstrate the utility of monochromated electron sources and phase plates for imaging of conjugated polymers.  Educational objectives are motivated by the need to enhance diversity in engineering.  A number of specific programs will be implemented encompassing recruitment, retention, and mentoring of underrepresented groups."

One such mechanism is the rearrangement of chromosomes that may change the genomic structure of species in a way that limits the potential for hybridization. This project will study a model fish species, topminnows, in order to understand how divergence and chromosomal rearrangements may interact to determine the dynamics of naturally occurring hybrid zones. The research will also be used in development of high school curricula to teach evolutionary concepts and to provide research experiences for undergraduates.  <br/><br/>Topminnows in the Fundulus notatus species complex have broadly overlapping ranges throughout much of the Mississippi River basin and northern Gulf of Mexico drainages. Earlier work with these species identified a number of replicate hybrid zones where the hybridizing species and populations differ in levels of divergence and, in some cases, chromosome number.  The researchers will use modern genomic tools to quantify the amount of hybridization and patterns of introgression in eight replicate hybrid zones. Artificial breeding experiments in the laboratory will produce progeny that will facilitate the production of genetic maps of hybridizing populations. Genetic maps will elucidate spatial patterns of gene flow in replicate hybrid zones. Experimental hybrid zone trials will also examine mate choice dynamics and the viability of hybrid offspring."

Consider the example of physical rehabilitation. Exercises performed under the supervision of a physical therapist will be done properly. But once the patient goes home, there is no assurance that the exercises necessary for recovery are done properly, or at all. With modern information technology such as smart phones and radio-capable sensors, it is now possible to deploy systems that are easy for patients to use that provide such monitoring. Together with processing of the data the sensors produce, meaningful feedback can be provided to both the patients and their caregivers on how well they are doing the exercises, and whether they can progress to the next set. This promises both better care and lower cost in providing it. This is especially important with the aging of the population, and the need for additional assistance in achieving independent living for as long as possible. Students will work on developing new technologies for such applications during their summer research. Some of the projects initiated will then be used as the jumping off point for undergraduate and graduate courses in the following year for many more students to develop them further while also learning about this emerging field of wireless health. Thus, the research and educational components are tightly coupled, resulting in training of many engineers to support the important societal goal of improved and lower cost healthcare.<br/><br/><br/>This Site will impact both scientific and educational research communities. The intellectual focus of this proposal is on the development of wireless health experimental equipment and procedures with the goal of enabling large-scale deployments in the community for applications including physical rehabilitation, monitoring of chronic conditions, sports training and promotion of wellness (e.g., through exercise). Presently, monitoring methods are either costly or require elaborate calibration; our focus is on robust procedures that are tolerant of equipment misuse. To this end, tools and procedures produced in the summers will be further extended in regular courses, including senior design, to harden the designs through exposure to larger populations. In this way a much larger of group of undergraduate students will participate in research, with tools that are refreshed in each academic year. This research will have multiple benefits: increasing students' skills, knowledge base, and preparation for future study; and contributing to research breakthroughs with scientific, medical, and social relevance. The main objective of this Site is to provide high quality research experiences and professional development to undergraduates, especially women and underrepresented students. Our recruitment efforts will focus on identifying students from other institutions, particularly those that may not have access to research opportunities, to participate in the program. With carefully designed research projects, participating undergraduates become actively involved in the research of the Wireless Health Institute, gaining a first-hand experience of life as a graduate student. This experience (balancing research, professional development, and networking activities) benefits the undergraduate scholars but also provides value to participating graduate student and faculty mentors, and the broader research communities. Moreover, the tools and procedures developed will each year support 50 undergraduates per year in pursuing research through regularly scheduled senior design courses. Finally, students in other summer research programs, particularly from community colleges, participate in our scaffolding designed to enhance progress to research."

The high number of species in this region was once thought to be due to the antiquity of rainforest habitats; however, recent studies suggest that many Neotropical flowering plant groups have been diversifying in the last 10-20 my. Recent episodes of plant diversification in the neotropics raise questions such as why have there been so many recent speciation events and what were the contributing biotic and abiotic factors. This study aims to investigate the biogeography and origin of Vochysia, a strictly Neotropical group that is hyper-diverse, widely distributed and relatively young. By contributing to a better understanding about the drivers of recent diversification in a group of plants, it will lead to an improvement in general conservation strategies since it will improve knowledge about species distribution and diversification. This research will be valuable for the academic progress of a graduate student and an undergraduate student that is gaining experience in bioinformatics, data analysis, laboratory, and herbarium protocols. <br/><br/>This project seeks to improve the knowledge of the historical biogeography of plants of the neotropics by investigating the tempo and mode of Vochysia diversification. A phylogenetic reconstruction of the group will be done using next generation sequencing and computational analytical tools to provide a phylogenetic tree for investigating the evolutionary history of Vochysia. The analysis of the mode of evolution will be done using software for phylogenetic tree dating calibration, biogeographical reconstruction, and niche modeling. Results from these analyses will allow inferences to be made about the relative importance of vicariance versus dispersal and niche conservatism versus divergence with an emphasis on endemic and rare species of Vochysia. The tempo of Vochysia diversification will involve comparing the net diversification rates within the genus and between sub-clades from different biomes using a modern Bayesian-based software that models the complex dynamics of species diversification."

By utilizing massive-parallel DNA sequencing methodologies this project will address questions concerning the rapid diversification of a group birds (White-eyes or Zosterops) found on the island of Sulawesi in the Indonesian archipelago. This study will make use of whole genome sequencing to compare levels of divergence among a suite of closely related Zosterops species. This approach will permit the detection of regions of the genome that are potentially responsible for the rapid divergence in plumage that we see among this remarkable radiation of passerine birds. Further, Indonesia is home to many birds that are on the brink of extinction, and with the advent of new genetic techniques, research such as this study will likely uncover cryptic diversity and hence many more potentially endangered species requiring conservation efforts. Through the description of new populations and/or species, the research findings will be shared with the Indonesian government in hopes of informing conservation policy and helping to preserve their unique and diverse biota.<br/><br/>This study takes an integrated approach to elucidate phylogeographic, and evolutionary processes that underlie the unique diversity of Wallacea. Genomic data from this project will provide an unparalleled perspective on the underlying processes that are driving high levels of endemism and species richness in the region of Wallacea. Furthermore, it will provide a detailed view into the processes underlying the diversification of one of the most speciose groups of birds on the planet (Zosterops). Only one other study has ever been performed in this context (Darwin's Finches), between islands and along environmental gradients within a rapidly speciating lineage. Furthermore the entire region of Wallacea and the Australasian tropics remains vastly understudied. Understanding the genomic changes among members of the Sulawesi Zosterops species complex will reveal evolutionarily and ecologically important loci underlying the processes that have allowed this group to radiate across the Old World and thus provide insight into the drivers of global avian diversification."

The first is the motion of Earth's plates relative to one another due to convection of the underlying mantle and the force balance on the plate - we call this ""plate tectonics"". The second mechanism is motion of all of the plates together due to shifting mass anomalies within the Earth and associated rotational imbalance, which can cause reorientation relative to Earth's spin axis. This reorientation motion is referred to as true polar wander, and the rate at it proceeds is dependent on the viscosity of Earth's interior, which is poorly constrained both today and through Earth History. This research targets a particular interval of time around 800 million years ago when it has been proposed that true polar wander was much faster than usual -fast enough that parts of Earth's surface may have moved the distance of the length of football field in around 100 years. The PIs seek to track ancient plate movement in Mongolia and China to test this hypothesis using rocks of this age. They will do so using the magnetic directions preserved in the ancient rocks combined with U/Pb radiogenic isotope dates to precisely determine their age. These data will be used constrain both the rate that plates were moving and the relative movement of different plates in order to determine if the motion is consistent with rapid true polar wander. The results will inform Earth Scientists about the drivers of apparent plate motion at this time and the past position of the continents. The data also have the potential to place constraints on the viscosity of Earth's interior through time.<br/><br/>It has been proposed that large-scale, oscillatory true polar wander (TPW) occurred at ca. 800 Ma, associated with a carbon isotope interval known as the Bitter Springs Stage. Recent advances have led to a temporally quantified framework for the Bitter Springs Stage that enables this TPW hypothesis to be tested in non-carbonate-bearing lithologies, such as successions of extrusive volcanics. This project seeks to test the hypothesis through the development of new paleomagnetic and geochronological data from Mongolia and South China. The goal of the research is to robustly quantify Earth's rotational stability through this critical period of Earth history and allow for rates of TPW to be constrained. The Bitter Springs TPW hypothesis has become a central component of models for how continents aggregate into supercontinents, for fundamental inferences into the viscosity of Earth's mantle and the stabilizing effect of the remanent bulge and excess ellipticity, and for the planetary context of Neoproterozoic environmental change. Furthermore, the hypothesis of rapid TPW at ca. 800 Ma has become a significant component of models for the configuration of the supercontinent Rodinia. This project seeks to constrain the rate of pole movement during this interval through the development of new geochronological and paleomagnetic data from the Zavkhan Volcanics of Mongolia and the Banxi Group of South China in robust stratigraphic context. Importantly, these successions contain: (1) abundant volcanic rocks containing zircon from which high-precision U-Pb chemical abrasion-ion dilution-thermal mass spectrometry (CA-ID-TIMS) dates can be obtained and (2) paleomagnetic confidence tests indicating preservation of primary magnetization. Three years of field work, paleomagnetic analysis, and the development of CA-ID-TIMS U-Pb dates will focus on producing high quality pole paths for the Zavkhan Terrane of Mongolia and the South China craton from ca. 820 to 750 Ma. Such paths can be used to further test whether rapid oscillatory TPW occurred through this interval and, if so, at what rates. Testing and constraining this hypothesis is necessary for progress on the co-evolution of the solid earth and the surface through the time period and determining whether there were time periods in the Precambrian where it can be robustly shown that rates of TPW were higher than those resolved in the Phanerozoic. The broader impacts of the proposed research are four-fold: (1) the training and development of a UC Berkeley graduate student; (2) engagement of undergraduate students in basic research; (3) cultural exchange with Mongolian students in the field and in both of the PIs labs and (4) effective communication of a set of Earth systems history learning goals to K-12 communities through the construction of an educational display module in conjunction with the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH). This educational exhibit will be focused on the geological record of Asia and will include: (1) large rock samples that can be touched; (2) photographs from field expeditions; (3) educational displays about geochronology and paleomagnetism; and (4) a video explaining the geophysical techniques used in this study. Following display in the Earth Science exhibit galleries at HMNH, the exhibit module will travel for display in the Earth and Planetary Science Department at UC Berkeley and then to the Mongolia University for Science and Technology in Ulaanbaatar.

This award funds research on a novel micro-machining process that addresses several existing challenges, namely limitations in the machinability of materials, patterning large areas at economically feasible material removal rates, and generating micro-features of different sizes and shapes.  A fully realized magnetically-assisted laser induced plasma micro-machining process will be capable of fast and direct generation of micro-features with controlled geometrical characteristics.<br/><br/>In magnetically-assisted laser-induced plasma micro-machining, picosecond laser pulses induce a plasma plume within a liquid dielectric. The plasma plume removes material from the workpiece surface by a combination of thermal vaporization and mechanical erosion to create machined features with desired geometry. This project aims to advance processing capabilities in terms of machining rate and precision by utilizing the external magnetic field's influence on the plasma plume through two mechanisms: (1) by increasing its energy density, leading to increased material removal rates; and (2) by modifying its shape, leading to the nearly direct creation of desired micro-feature geometries. The research objective is to understand the interaction between the electromagnetic and thermo-mechanical mechanisms of the process, i.e., interactions between the laser, dielectric, plasma, magnetic field and workpiece material. Methods to achieve this objective include simulations using magneto-hydrodynamic, particle-in-cell and finite element analysis methods to determine the outcomes of each interaction. Experiments with a wide variety of materials, including titanium alloys, silicon, polymers, and transparent, brittle and reflective materials such as glass, will be conducted using a picosecond laser system with a 532 nm wavelength, a computer-controlled array of electromagnets, and focus variation-based metrology. Experimental results will be compared with simulation results in terms of the depth and shape of the generated features and material removal rate."

Understanding the genetic basis of such traits, which can be affected by hundreds of genes, is vital to understanding how populations respond to environmental change. Species in the wild often exist in subpopulations spread across different environments, and each environment may experience different conditions. However, subpopulations can be connected because individuals travel across space and then mate with individuals in other subpopulations. Recent studies on species in the wild have shown that even though migration and gene flow occurs, populations in different environments retain their uniqueness. Scientists are interested in determining how populations retain this genetic separation. Therefore, studies of the genetic basis of particular traits may shed light on this phenomenon. This study focuses on a system where the researchers can control migration and then examine the genetic underpinnings of traits that are unique to different populations. In particular the researchers are interested in how organisms respond to a novel heat stress environment. The work will aid in the training of a graduate student and underrepresented minorities. <br/><br/>This study will use the model nematode Caenorhabditis remanei to (1) examine how migration interacts with selection to affect the ability of a population to adapt to a novel heat stress environment, and (2) dissect the genetic basis of heat stress resistance. This project will use experimental evolution and next generation sequencing to dissect the genetic basis of chronic heat stress resistance. By including the effects of migration of non-adapted individuals into a heat stressed environment, this study will not only find the determinants of the genetic basis of heat stress resistance, but will also directly test the hypothesis that low levels of migration increase the strength of the genetic signal underlying novel adaptations."

Based on these data, undocumented species will be identified, characterized and formally described. Two major hypotheses will be tested: whether arid-adapted species of S.W.

Specimens obtained in survey efforts will be subjected to collection and analysis of ecological, genetic, and morphological data. Molecular systematic analyses of the genetic data will identify cryptic species and targeted high-throughput sequencing will be used to test biogeographic hypotheses. Morphological data collection will include external morphological examination as well as high-resolution CT scanning to identify diagnostic internal anatomical features of species under study. Ecological niche modeling of species' ranges will be used to explore patterns of faunal turnover and identify conservation priorities.

The present work addresses fundamentals of the nanoconfinement behavior of materials that form the basis of the relevant enabling technologies. One important set of problems addressed relates to the engineering properties (such as stiffness and yield strength) of nanometer-thick films that are in freely standing form and, consequently, cannot be readily measured. The only method available for making such measurements in such materials is a bubble-inflation method developed in the PI's laboratory that allows testing of extremely small quantities of material, especially nanometer-thin polymer films. The work investigates the engineering properties of freely standing polymer films deep in the glassy state with particular emphasis on yield behavior. These studies will be the first to provide film thickness and temperature dependence of yield in freely standing films. Also, in the freely standing films, a large enhancement in the material stiffness is observed and, recently, conflicting theoretical models of the stiffening behavior have appeared to explain the phenomenon.  Such predictions are, of course important to nanomaterial design and use, and the present work will establish the range of validity of these theories. Molecular architecture effects will also be investigated. Finally, the nanobubble inflation experiment permits investigations of novel materials that were previously unachievable due to their extremely small quantities. In this case, the investigators will study ultrastable polymer glasses made by physical vapor deposition (PVD) and that can be made more stable than even a 20 million year old amber glass. This high stability allows the interrogation of a long-standing question whose resolution is fundamental to theories of glasses and, in particular, how to make long-term predictions of their behavior in applications to important areas such as advanced composites and adhesives.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The behavior of ultrathin polymer films remains an intense area of investigation, but most studies have been limited to the case of substrate-supported films even though studies suggest much larger effects occur in the freely standing state. The present work tests three aspects of freely standing ultrathin films using the TTU bubble inflation method and takes advantage of the method's capability of making viscoelastic measurements on extremely small quantities of material to study the response of an ultrastable polymer glass made by physical vapor deposition (PVD). One important set of problems addressed relates to the engineering properties, such as modulus and yield strength of nanometer thick films that are in freely standing form and, consequently, not readily measured. The only method available for making such measurements in such materials is a bubble inflation method that allows testing of extremely small quantities of material, especially ultrathin or nano-metric polymer films. The work investigates the engineering properties of freely standing polymer films deep in the glassy state with particular emphasis on yield behavior. Also, in freely standing films, a large modulus enhancement is observed and, recently, conflicting theoretical models of the stiffening behavior have appeared to explain the phenomenon.  Such predictions are, of course important to nanomaterial design and use and the present work will establish the range of validity of these theories.  Branched polymers have been shown to exhibit different nanoscale behavior from linear counterparts upon confinement on a supporting layer and the TTU bubble inflation method will be used to examine the effects of branching and unentangled polymer chain length on the viscoelastic properties of freely standing ultrathin films. Finally, it remains controversial whether or not the dynamics (relaxation time or viscosity) in glass-forming liquids, including polymers, diverge at a finite temperature. The PI's group has now demonstrated the first PVD ultrastable polymer glass that can be used to determine the upper bound relaxation times in a fashion similar to prior work with a 20 million year old amber but over a larger ""window"" of temperatures because the PVD polymer has a fictive temperature at least 50 K below the glass transition temperature, and optimization of the PVD conditions offers the possibility of an even larger testing window. Should the experiment be successful, it will provide further experimental data that can challenge theories of the behavior of glass-forming systems."

This project will use the plant genus Protea to investigate functional traits in an environmentally diverse region of the world. The project will also determine the genetic bases for those trade-offs and relationships. This project will connect regional relationships between traits and the environment with experimental manipulations and advanced genetic techniques. It will contribute to the fields of ecology, phylogenetics, and evolution, and provide a new context and potentially new directions to the study of plant functional traits. Additionally, the project includes the training of graduate and undergraduate students, the mentoring of middle and high school students, and the development of online educational materials. <br/><br/>Although trait-based ecology is a huge field of study, little attention has been paid to how these ecologically important traits have evolved or to the genetic architecture underlying them.

A manipulative dry-down experiment based on intensive, microgeographic field sampling and collection of seeds is being performed to determine the scale of trait-environment patterns and to identify mechanisms underlying niche filtering in the hybrid zone. Single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data derived from restriction-site associated DNA sequencing (RADseq) will be used for association mapping of ecologically important traits.

Decades of work have gone into understanding the effects of defects on properties, but the vast majority of this prior work has focused on static or steady-state conditions. Ferroelectrics (materials with a permanent dipole that can be reoriented by an electric field) and piezoelectrics (materials that develop an electric charge when a mechanical stress is applied) are important for applications ranging from memory devices and capacitors that help cram more features into smaller electronic devices to actuators that increase automotive fuel economy and devices that harvest ambient vibrational energy. These types of materials are commonly used under dynamic conditions in which moving domain walls dominate the property responses. This project uses new experimental techniques and unique sample sets to improve the quantitative descriptions of the interactions of these moving domain walls with ubiquitous point defects and interfaces such as vacancies and grain boundaries. Better understanding of domain wall interactions with defects and interfaces enables improved performance from Pb-free piezoelectrics and active control of high-value catalysts which are free of toxic or precious metals, thus using more sustainable materials to produce devices that contribute to increased energy efficiency and process sustainability across a variety of industries. The project integrates with the PI?s extensive efforts to expand student engagement including participation in an annual Discover STEM! Camp, curriculum development, and introduction of a hot glass shop on campus. A student swap agreement allows the supported graduate student to work for several weeks each year with collaborators in Virginia and Australia, taking advantage of the tools and expertise available in those groups while benefitting from the experience of living and working in a different environment.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: This work links the abstract energy barriers currently used to describe the domain nucleation and pinning processes to real chemical and/or structural features in order to identify and generalize the conditions under which various features serve as nucleation and/or pinning sites. The sample sets and experiments isolate variables (e.g., domain wall interactions with cation vacancies and with grain boundaries separately) and apply new tools including atom probe and X-ray tomographies, time domain thermal reflectance, and a custom low-impedance drive circuit to develop fundamental mechanistic descriptions of domain nucleation and pinning that will apply broadly across many materials families."

Registration expenses for 20 invited speakers would be supported from this award. <br/><br/>The uniqueness of this Symposium is in that it will bring together cross-disciplinary scientists from around the globe to have focused discussions on fundamental problems related to the Sun-Earth System and space weather. The main emphasis will be put on the integration of these studies - ranging from observations to related interpretation, theory and numerical modeling across different temporal and spatial scales of this system. It will thus provide training for new researchers in geospace system science. Young postdoctoral and early career researchers are expected to come away from the Symposium with a better appreciation of the benefits of interdisciplinary approaches to understanding the dynamic near-Earth space environment."

Although natural gas is widely used for heating and to generate electricity, it is not typically employed as a transportation fuel. This is because methane (the major component of natural gas) is a gas that cannot be turned into a liquid at room temperature using pressure. Converting methane into a compound that is liquid at room temperature, such as a larger hydrocarbon (e.g., octanes) or methanol, will make it much more useful as a transportation fuel.  Professor Metz is also helping to introduce eighth-grade girls to research in STEM fields through the Eureka! program. The broader impacts of this work include potential benefits from improved catalysts as well as the training of graduate and undergraduate students in mass spectrometry and laser spectroscopy and in broader skills such as problem solving, instrument design, data acquisition and analysis and communication of their results.<br/><br/>Metal cluster ion-methane/ammonia complexes are produced in a laser ablation source, cooled via supersonic expansion and characterized using vibrational and electronic spectroscopy in a mass spectrometer. Interaction of the methane or ammonia ligand with the metal weakens the carbon (C)-hydrogen (H) or nitrogen (N)-H bonds in the ligand, and this weakening is key to the subsequent catalytic activation of these bonds. The experiments measure bond weakening and polarization by the metal, as they lead to red shifts in vibrational frequencies and enhanced IR absorption. Vibrational spectroscopy also reveals the identity of reaction intermediates and products in cases where multiple isomers could be involved, as in sequential methane activation. By studying different metals and clusters with differing numbers of metal atoms, these studies elucidate the structural and electronic factors that lead to size-dependent reactivity. Complementary velocity map imaging studies study ion dissociation dynamics following electronic excitation, measuring accurate bond strengths and probing the couplings between excited electronic states. The broader impacts of this work include potential benefits from improved catalysts as well as the training of graduate and undergraduate students."

In turn, ecological restoration has been hailed as a critical conservation tool for its ability to promote biodiversity through the repair of damaged ecosystems and creation of new habitats. Yet, restoration outcomes are notoriously unpredictable and this hinders land managers' abilities to reliably repair damaged ecosystems. This project will evaluate the causes of variation in restoration outcomes by investigating the process of community assembly - how assemblages of species develop over time - during restoration. In doing so, it will guide restoration practice, advance the field of restoration ecology through the coupling of basic ecological theory and ecosystem management, and test long-standing, fundamental questions about why the diversity and composition of ecological communities vary among locations. Furthermore, this project will train new restoration scientists and strengthen linkages between restoration research and practice through classroom instruction, student and postdoc training, and partnerships with land management agencies conducting restoration.<br/><br/>This project will take place within a system of prairie grasslands restored through the sowing of native prairie seeds onto former agricultural lands. A goal of this work will be to understand how community assembly and restoration outcomes are influenced by environmental conditions that vary in space and time (soil fertility and rainfall), and as a function of two factors describing ecological communities - the number of species and number of individuals for each species, within communities. Focal questions will be evaluated experimentally and across a network of large-scale grasslands undergoing restoration, forging a link between mechanism-oriented experiments and real-world assembled ecosystems."

Moreover, recent studies show that geothermal heating is an important driver of deep ocean circulation, which is a major component of the ocean-atmosphere system.  As a part of a large multidisciplinary and international research program, this project will develop the first high-resolution models of how crustal heat and mass transfer impact deep ocean circulation. The proposed work will lead to a better understanding of deep ocean circulation and its connection with the global ocean-atmosphere system. The proposed work also will yield an important advance in understanding how crustal heat and mass transfer evolves as the oceanic crust ages.  The project supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The proposed research forms an integral component of the large multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional project led by the University of Durham, England.  This research will use recently collected physical oceanographic, geophysical, and conductive heat flow data, together with existing data sets from the Panama Basin in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, to construct hydrothermal heat and mass flux models from the Costa Rica Rift (CRR) axis to sediment-covered, 6 million year old crust.  The goals are: (1) to understand how hydrothermal heat transfer evolves with crustal structure as the lithospheric ages; and (2) to develop high resolution models that show how hydrothermal heat and mass transfer impacts deep ocean circulation on a regional scale.  To achieve these goals, 85 new conductive heat flow measurements have been obtained in sediment-covered crust at ages between 1.3 and 5.3 Ma co-located with a multi-channel seismic line.  These data will be used together with existing heat flow data, and the geophysical and oceanographic data from the British-led project, to construct mathematical and numerical models of hydrothermal heat transfer in young sediment-covered crust. In addition, other geophysical data on the distribution of melt and partial melt in axial and near-axial regions, coupled with water samples for helium analysis and oceanographic data characterizing the ocean bottom boundary layer and hydrothermal plume structure at the CRR, will constrain models of hydrothermal circulation at the ridge axis and in near-axial regions. These analyses will provide the first estimates of hydrothermal heat output at the CRR and near-axis region, and will guide future exploration of hydrothermal activity, geochemical transport, and the biological communities at the CRR. Finally, the hydrothermal models will serve as input to high-resolution models of ocean circulation using the detailed suite of oceanographic data collected during the British-led project."

The first research objective is to establish relationships between process parameters and the quality of 3D electrode architecture produced by the processes. Process parameters of aerosol jet-based additive manufacturing include carrier gas pressure, and nanoparticle size and dispersion; and sintering process parameters include sintering energy and time. The quality of 3D electrode architecture will be measured in terms of porosity level, pore geometry, specific capacity, and resistance to capacity fade. This objective will be achieved by carrying out experimental research guided by theoretical models. The solidification of nanoparticle solutions upon dispense and the consecutive sintering process will be modelled by using a discretized particle model and a diffusive model. Further, a model that solves the Li diffusion equation coupled with stress evolution and the cracking in the porous electrode will be developed using a multi-scale modeling approach. These models will guide the additive fabrication experiments using high specific capacity materials such as silicon and silicon dioxide. The second objective is to identify relationships between the characteristics of an artificial coating on the electrode and the resistance to electrode capacity fade. The characteristics of the coating include the thickness and uniformity of the coated layer. To achieve this objective, atomic layer deposition will be used to create an electrode-electrolyte interface layer over the 3D porous electrodes. Several microscopic analyses such as atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy will be used to measure the coating thickness and uniformity. Battery electrochemical experiments will then be carried out and the resistance to capacity fade will be measured using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy."

Topological recursion is an emerging field of mathematics discovered independently in the study of random matrices and in studies of dynamics and geometry. The novelty of topological recursion is its universal applicability to many problems arising in areas of mathematics and quantum physics.  For example, Catalan numbers, simple combinatorial expressions that occur in various counting problems, have generalizations associated with surfaces of complicated structure that can be calculated effectively by topological recursion. The exact same formula computes important quantities arising in the study of quantum gravity. Topological recursion not only provides theoretical formulas for many concrete problems in mathematics and physics, but also furnishes a practical computational tool. The interplay between machine computation and mathematical proof has been a driving force for recent rapid development of the field, in which many outstanding conjectures have been resolved, while new mysteries have arisen, both on the theoretical front and in computer experiments.  This timely symposium, in which half of the invited speakers are early-career researchers, is aimed to further advance this exciting, rapidly-developing field.<br/><br/>Topological recursion is a new emerging field of mathematics developed in statistical mechanical study of random matrices. Independently, essentially the same structure of the theory was discovered in research on the volume of moduli spaces of bordered hyperbolic surfaces. Due to the simple nature of concrete recursive formulas, topological recursion relates many current research frontiers of mathematics in a novel and understandable way. For example, counting Hurwitz numbers, Gromov-Witten theory, Gaiotto's conjecture on opers arising from string theory, the WKB analysis of Schroedinger equations, and the relation between A-polynomials and colored Jones polynomials for knots and their generalizations are all deeply related through ideas stemming from topological recursion. The goal of the symposium is to promote interest among young researchers in this exciting research frontier and to significantly enhance the subject matter by disseminating recent progress and identifying important problems for future development.

Agricultural productivity provides a solid foundation for population growth, social complexity and the emergence of cities and states. However, there is a huge intellectual gap between our understanding of the earliest domestication and cultivation of limited crops and intensive agriculture practiced by early states. How was agriculture intensified over time? What resources were required to intensify food production? What is the driving force behind the processes of agricultural intensification? Questions concerning agricultural intensification have attracted but also puzzled scholars in various fields for a long time. Within this broader context, Dr. Tristram R. Kidder and Mr. Zhen Qin, of Washington University in St. Louis, will undertake research in the Central Plain of China to explore the process of agricultural intensification, defined as an increase in the productive output per unit of land, and its relationship with environmental change. This project will provide first-hand field data on buried agricultural fields and therefore be helpful for both testing ideas about agriculture put forth in historical written documents and gaining new comprehension of agricultural intensification; it will also make theoretical contribution to agricultural intensification from an site-specific, bottom-up perspective by use of well-preserved archaeological datasets. Beyond academia, this project also has broader impacts. Firstly, it will contribute to the local community by recruiting local people to do fieldwork, including coring, test excavation, and sampling. Through their participation, a deeper understanding of their history and identity will be gained. Secondly, this project will be carried out in collaboration with the local institute and this collaboration will promote mutual understanding and trust through the team working and reciprocal learning between U.S. and Chinese researchers who are from different cultural traditions.<br/><br/>To obtain a further understanding of how agricultural intensification was achieved and why agriculture was intensified, Dr. Kidder, Mr. Qin and their collaborators in China will conduct a large-scale excavation of ancient fields, a systematic collection of soil samples, and a comprehensive analysis of geoarchaeological results. The excavation will be carried out at Sanyangzhuang site, Neihuang County, Henan Province in central China. In this site, three strata of ancient agricultural field with ridge-and-furrow features, have been found. Based on these unique relics well preserved by the Yellow River flood sediments, the research team will explore the question of ""how"" by examining the field management techniques, including plowing, manuring, and irrigation, as an implementation path of agricultural intensification; micromophology and elemental analysis also will be deployed. For the question of ""why"", local paleoenvironment will be reconstructed and environment-induced risks, such as climate changes and the Yellow River floods, will be investigated as one of major driving forces of agricultural intensification by means of isotopic analysis and conventional geoarchaeological analysis."

Each of these organisms, from bacteria to butterflies to bison, best contribute to these services when they consume a healthy diet, which includes access to minerals, especially sodium. Sodium is a critical mineral for ecosystems because plants are generally low in sodium but the things that eat them, from fungi to grasshoppers, require it to grow and reproduce.  Thus every plant eater must search out, harvest, and hang onto quantities of sodium, and will go to extremes eating carcasses, soil, and urine, to get that quota. Moreover, sodium is not uniformly distributed on the landscape.  It falls as dilute ocean water near the coasts, it clings to clay soils but is leached from sandy soils, and it is distributed by the truckload to keep snowy roads free from ice. This project combines these two facts, that sodium is potentially one of the most important drivers of the health of plant consumers, and that sodium is geographically patchy, to predict the abundance and services of plant consumers across the North American continent. This research should lead to better prediction of such disparate phenomena as why grasshoppers are bigger crop pests in one county than another; why carbon is better stored in inland soils than those near the ocean; and why termite damage claims are centered along the Gulf Coast of the U.S. and up into the Mid-Atlantic states.<br/><br/>To evaluate this proposition, the project combines two methods. The first maps the distribution of sodium across and within North American ecosystems and focuses on the easily accessible and widespread grasslands, old fields, and roadsides, and the invertebrates that live in them. The goal in Year 1 is to explore the basic hypothesis that as soil supplies of sodium increase - due to deposition from the ocean, high clay content, or because they are salted every winter - plants will not be affected but the animals that eat them (and the predators that eat the plant consumers) will. Thus the first year will generate a map of the abundance and activity of invertebrates above and belowground, and the degree to which both track sodium supply (and other nutrients). Then, in Year 2 and 3, these correlations will be put to the test experimentally in 6 grasslands from the central and eastern U.S. At each grassland, 50 meter square plots will be fertilized with a dilute sodium concentrations mimicking the slightly salty rainfall of the island of Puerto Rico; smaller plots will receive sodium mimicking that deposited on a regular basis by every animal as urine. By carefully tracking where the sodium goes, and how it boosts the numbers and activity of invertebrates, the project will test how animal health and vigor across North America is influenced by sodium supply. By examining how pollinators, herbivores, and detritivores respond, the project will test the transformative idea that sodium is a catalyst for ecosystem services."

The composition and internal layout of the cytoskeleton is different from cell to cell. Some differences are purely random but there are also clear systematic architectural differences between various cell types. For example, cells involved in diseases (e.g. cancer) often have markedly different cytoskeleton from cells in a healthy organism. It is currently not clear how different cytoskeletal architectures relate to overall cell biomechanical properties. One of the problems hindering progress has been the inability to reproducibly assemble cytoskeletal networks in a controlled environment. However, a recently developed nano-scale assembly technique allows for exactly this: the longest and least flexible cytoskeletal filaments known as microtubules can now be assembled and manipulated with sufficient flexibility and precision to build structures in a controlled environment which mimic what is seen in cells. Research conducted under this award will use this novel approach to examine the biomechanical properties of a number of key biologically relevant filament architectures. The work will also examine how the biomechanics of microtubule cytoskeleton changes when the architecture is identical but the overall size of the filament structure is varied instead. These measurements together will provide both a big picture view (the role of microtubule network architecture in cellular biomechanics) and small scale perspective (how stress propagates across the network).<br/><br/>This research will examine several key microtubule network topologies. A recently demonstrated holographic optical trapping approach will be used to assemble microtubule networks in vitro in 3D. Holographic and ordinary trapping will be used together to manipulate and to probe such networks in situ. For a given network layout, this study will also establish how the biomechanical properties of the model network change with overall scale. Therefore, the extent to which select microtubule network architectures contribute to cellular biomechanics will be established. The role of filaments and cross-links with different mechanical properties will also be quantitatively examined using the same experimental technique."

This project will investigate the underlying causes of the switch between alternative communities, dominated by either seaweeds or mussels, on sheltered rocky shores in the Gulf of Maine.  A unique long-term experiment will advance general understanding of the resilience of natural communities to ecological perturbations of different sizes, the extent to which ecological transitions are reversible when environmental conditions are restored, and the predictability of ecological communities when perturbed.  The research team includes a high school teacher from Maine who has a long association with this project. Six to eight of her students will participate in the field research each year, and the teacher will develop classroom activities appropriate for high school students and K-12 teachers. Primary data, panoramic photographs of the experimental plots, and educational activities will be available electronically, and the investigators will post a YouTube video on data archiving and management. <br/><br/>The researchers will test hypotheses that (1) switches between alternative community states of mussel beds and rockweed stands occur in response to infrequent, large-scale occurrences of ice scour during winter, (2) the community that becomes established in large clearings made by ice scour is not predictable, (3) the order of species arrival during re-establishment drives community development and (4) the alternative communities are stable. These hypotheses will be tested using a Before-After-Control-Impact (BACI) design consisting of experimental clearings of different sizes, uncleared controls that were created in 1996-97, and half of these controls that were cleared again in 2010-11. In addition to collecting data characterizing patterns of succession in these developing communities, the researchers will assay rates of predation on mussels, mortality rates of mussels in patches of different sizes, and recruitment of juveniles of four key species annually. Analyses of data will compare outcomes from the first run of the experiment (1997-2008) with those from the second run (2011-2021) to test if community development is predictable. The approach of repeating an experiment to test for alternative community states in a natural ecosystem is unique and has broad implications for studies of alternative states in other ecosystems."

Recent changes in climate may disrupt these ecologically and economically important relationships. Warm springs and early snowmelt associated with climate change alter when plants flower and pollinators emerge in the spring, which may make pollinators unavailable to plants that flower too soon or too late. In addition, decreased snow cover and early snowmelt likely reduce soil moisture during the growing season on mountain slopes. Such drought conditions may decrease the number of flowers, their size or the amount of nectar they contain, which may make them less attractive to pollinators. This research tests effects of soil moisture and timing of flower and pollinator emergence on pollination. The expectation is that drought will greatly decrease pollination through both changes in flowering time and attractiveness. This work will help reveal how the relationship between plants and pollinators responds to climate change, and will improve the ability of land-managers and policy-makers to plan conservation efforts. This project also includes opportunities to engage undergraduate students and public school teachers in field research, as well as providing gateway experiences for children into science through two K-12 outreach programs.<br/><br/>This project tests the hypothesis that differences in flowering time interact with water availability to affect the composition and number of pollinator visits. Using field-tested methods, researchers will manipulate flowering time and soil moisture in a factorial experiment with the sub-alpine wildflower Mertensia ciliata. They will measure the impact on pollination and seed set via shifts in the composition and number of pollinator visits, and will determine how those effects may be mediated by changes in floral traits. Experimental results will be integrated with on-going observational studies of individual, population, and community-level responses to natural variation in soil moisture and flowering phenology. Similar field experiments testing the impacts of abiotic and biotic shifts on plant-pollinator interactions are rare. Yet, such experimental approaches can offer vital insights into the mechanisms that determine how pollination systems respond to climate change.  All analyzed data under this award will be disseminated at professional conferences, published in peer-reviewed journals, and made publically available."

Visual attributes refer to human-namable and machine-detectable inherent characteristics of visual content from objects, scenes, and activities (e.g., four-legged, outdoor, and crowded). They possess versatile properties and application potentials by offering a natural human-computer interaction channel for involving humans in the loop of machine vision algorithms, serving as basic building blocks for one to compose categories and describe instances, and bringing rich prior knowledge and regularization to statistical learning models, to name a few. The project advances the long-standing pursuit of utilizing attributes for a wide variety of visual recognition and search tasks. The project also actively engages graduate and undergraduate students, and outreaches local high-school students. The research results from this project can impact several related communities such as NLP, speech, and robotics, etc.. <br/> <br/>This research explicitly tackles the need that attribute detectors should generalize well across different categories, including those previously unseen ones. The research team approaches the problem based on multi-source domain generalization by taking each category as a domain. In particular, this project develops new feature extraction tools tailored to account for the middle-level attributes, as opposed to the traditional features primarily designed and tested for high-level visual recognition. The project consists of three major thrusts hinging on the key motivation of the analogy between attribute detection and domain generalization. It begins by learning a fine-grained ""shallow"" feature mapping (Thrust I) to distill attribute-discriminative signals that are category-invariant, and then investigates ""deeper"" into the feature extraction frameworks - Fisher vectors (Thrust II) and convolutional neural networks (Thrust III)-to revise them for the purpose of attribute detection."

Microbiome science is in a transformation from being descriptive and technically challenging, to becoming hypothesis-driven, actionable, and technically straight-forward, in part enabled by QIIME.  We now know that the traditional approach for studying microbial communities, which relied on culturing microbes in the lab, is insufficient because we don't know the conditions required for the growth of most microbes.  Recent advances link microbiomes to functional processes via 'culture independent' techniques, such as sequencing fragments of microbial genomes, and then using those fragments as 'molecular fingerprints' to profile the microbiome.  The bottleneck in microbiome analysis is not DNA sequencing, but in interpreting the large quantities of sequence data generated.  QIIME 2 will advance knowledge of microbiomes by helping users derive insight through interactive exploratory analysis capabilities, understand the underlying methods, and report their results in ways accessible to end users from outside of the field, including physicians, engineers and policymakers who urgently need access to conclusions drawn from studies of complex microbial ecosystems.

At the same time, it will help users improve their computational skills through exposure to the underlying bioinformatics methods. QIIME 2 will have fully integrated provenance tracking, which will simplify reporting and reproducibility of bioinformatics workflows.  A first-class plugin system will decentralize development by allowing outside developers to add new methods to the QIIME 2 platform. The API will also support improved integration of QIIME as a component of other widely used systems, such as Illumina BaseSpace® and Qiita, and an automatically generated command line interface will be provided for power users.

Thus, BCI technology is a powerful control option for neuro-prosthetic limbs, as well as a potential communication option for people with severe motor disabilities or disorders such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), brainstem stroke, cerebral palsy, and spinal cord injury, who may have little or even no muscle control and therefore no means of communication with the external world.  The International Brain-Computer Interface (IBCI) meeting is the flagship conference for the field, the sixth of which will be held May 30-June 3, 2016, in Asilomar, California.  Effective BCI research requires interdisciplinary interactions involving neuroscience, psychology, engineering, mathematics, computer science, and clinical rehabilitation, and the IBCI meeting serves as a critical catalyst for technology dissemination, new collaborations, and educational opportunities for students.  The primary source of funding for the meeting is the National Institutes of Health (NIH).  This NSF funding will enable another 20 students, including undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, to attend and participate in the conference. Five of these twenty will be minority students who will receive full scholarships, while half of the remaining fifteen scholarships will be given to students who are women.  All of the NSF funding will be used for student travel, registration, and student-only event costs.  Student participation in the five previous IBCI meetings has been very fruitful; a large number of those students have now graduated and are prominent researchers in the BCI field.  The Brain-Computer Interface Journal has agreed to publish the conference proceedings as a series of peer reviewed papers in a special issue, which will further disseminate the results of the meeting. The organizers are actively recruiting student attendees from traditionally underrepresented groups.  More information about the conference may be found online at http://bcisociety.org/meetings/bci-meeting-2016-welcome/.  <br/><br/>Because of the growth in the field of BCI research, 300 or more participants are expected to attend this meeting, including investigators from at least 100 BCI research groups. All attendees commit to the entire meeting, from the opening reception and dinner on the evening of Monday, May 30 through the final summary discussion at breakfast the morning of Friday, June 3.  A main objective of the conference is to give students a significant educational and professional experience in the BCI field, and to provide opportunities for them to gain depth in their specific interest areas. The conference will begin with a specialized student colloquium on the afternoon before the full conference starts, which will provide lectures from prominent experts in the BCI field. This will give the students a solid foundation for understanding the rest of the conference.  There will also be a student poster session and prizes for the best student research projects, as well as giving students access to research leaders for informal question-and-answer sessions at the end of each day. The students will participate fully in the main conference as well.  Exposure to prominent researchers in the BCI field will allow students to receive invaluable feedback on their work, and to make connections that may result in new research directions; it will also provide students with access to potential mentors, committee members, and experts to review their future work.  A full and detailed schedule of planned conference sessions and events, along with any updates, can be found on the conference website.  With all participants housed on site and all meals for all attendees taken together on site, there will be ample opportunity for informal discussions. This creates a unique opportunity for students and trainees to mingle with and learn from established researchers."

Among polymer materials (plastics) the relevant properties often include strength, flexibility, the ability to break down in the body, etc.  Two such polymer materials, PEO and PCL, already find a variety of uses in the biomedical field, e.g. in implant coatings and medication-delivery systems.  The range of applications increases when these two materials are combined. To engineer a specific product, one must know how to develop specific structures in this combined material (PEO-PCL).  This research aims to understand how these structures develop and how to control the variability of the resultant properties.  By varying the temperature and characteristics of the solution from which these materials are processed, one is able to obtain desired properties including, but not limited to, strength, flexibility, and breakdown rate.  Polymers are uniquely suited for a variety of applications because their properties may span a large range depending on their chemistry and structure.  For example, plastics can be rigid and brittle or flexible and soft depending on their structure.  Understanding the development of PEO-PCL structures should lead to an increase in possible uses for this inexpensive, widely prevalent, and robust material.  Moreover, the results of this study could be applied to the study of the structures and properties of other biomedical, commodity, or sustainable plastics.  A second, but no less important, goal of this work is to train students in the broad disciplines of polymer and materials sciences and prepare them for careers in technology-related areas.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/><br/>Structural characterization is a critical component in predicting or tailoring the macroscopic properties of a material.  In diblock copolymers, the structure involves phase separation between the two components and possible crystallization of one or both of the components.  Poly(ethylene oxide)-block-poly(caprolactone) (PEO-b-PCL) copolymers are unique in several ways.  First, they are both crystallizable with similar transition temperatures.  Second, they are both prevalent in the biomedical field since they are biocompatible and since PCL is biodegradable.  Lastly, by combining hydrophilic PEO and hydrophobic PCL into a block copolymer, the material is amphiphilic allowing for transport of hydrophobic drugs into the body.  It is all of these traits that make these materials attractive for use in implant coatings and drug delivery systems.  For these applications, the ability to manipulate the strength, elasticity, and degradation rate, amongst other properties, is important.  These properties depend on how the material phase-separates and crystallizes from solution.  Since phase separation is driven by crystallization, the focus of this research is to understand the crystallization mechanism and then control the crystallinity of the material by changing processing conditions such as temperature, casting solvent, and molecular weight.  Using FTIR and DSC analyses, the crystallization of PEO and PCL blocks in samples with similar weight fractions or largely different weight fractions, cast from different solvents and/or annealed at different isothermal temperatures, will be monitored.  Because the transition temperatures are similar, thermodynamic and kinetic considerations can be manipulated more easily by changes in these parameters.  The goal is to pinpoint how each condition influences the crystallization mechanism, the overall crystallinity, and subsequent properties of interest in the biomedical field."

Movement across space to connect groups determines the strength of a network, the rates at which information spreads (social networks) or individuals interact (population networks), and the extent to which events in one group affect events in another group. This project will use a new tool to determine how, when, and why connections among populations determine whether a population persists or goes extinct. Results of the project will improve conservation and management plans for populations that are increasingly isolated by changes in land use. Improved conservation plans will be particularly important for endangered species that persist within weak networks. The project will advance the training and education of a doctoral student, who has developed and will improve a new experimental tool. Investigators will make the design and use of this tool publicly accessible, contributing to a democratic scientific process in which researchers co-design and share equipment. Use of this research approach will be extended to undergraduate and middle school students through programs that provide supervised independent research.<br/><br/>This project will use a newly-developed experimental chamber to test directly both assumptions and predictions of existing metapopulation models; metapopulations are groups of linked populations. Bacterial populations cultured in chambers will be connected by corridors in a homogeneous lattice or a strongly heterogeneous arrangement. Both colonization and extinction rates will be controlled by manipulating corridor configurations and by disturbing populations with tetracycline, causing extinction. These manipulations will compare patch occupancy and metapopulation persistence in homogenous and heterogeneous networks across a gradient of extinction-to-colonization ratios. The researchers will next design network treatments that conform to lattice, random, exponential, and power-law distributions to identify the threshold extinction-to-colonization ratio at which bacterial populations can no longer persist. A final manipulation will create 'lonely' populations that are connected to a single neighbor and compare population persistence to that of counterpart populations connected to diverse nodes in a network. These experiments will improve understanding of the effects of spatial heterogeneity on ecological and evolutionary processes and identify appropriate conservation strategies for metapopulations comprising strong versus weak networks."

Interviews with financial planners, life coaches, and personal trainers will document how they engage with client data. What data and views does each audience need, and how should this be integrated into their process for reflecting and acting? What tensions arise when sharing? How can personal informatics records help bridge different levels and types of expertise? Results will lead to new design approaches that make personal informatics data more valuable to people who already track and that will make self-tracking accessible to more people. The research will improve systems that help people make sense of their tracked data, which will lead to better personal informatics systems and, more broadly, improved practices for open-ended exploration of large, disparate data streams. Results will also contribute to theory about how people reflect on personal data individually and collaboratively, particularly among people with different levels of expertise."

This thermally induced water flux ubiquitously exists in porous materials, whenever both heat transfer and water movement are present. A scientific understanding of this phenomenon is an essential base for many important scientific and social challenges: climate effects on geomaterials, geothermal energy applications, behavior of porous materials under extreme conditions, and recovery of non-conventional fossil fuels such as gas hydrates and shale gas. However, despite the significance, this phenomenon has been an historically unsolved and perplexing issue affecting many science and engineering areas involving porous materials from traditional applications in civil engineering, soil science and petroleum engineering to emerging needs in microfluidics, material processing and biomechanics. This award supports the exploration of a new research concept/methodology and its application to reveal the physical mechanisms underlying thermally induced water flux for a complete scientific description and analysis framework for this phenomenon. As an exploratory study, which pioneers a very high-risk but possibly high-return concept, the success of the study may provide the geotechnical community a new understanding to tackle many issues which are hard to solve in the existing frameworks, and also provide a way to integrate porous material research which is currently distributed in various disciplines.  In addition to supporting a doctoral student, the project will support outreach activities for rural, low-socioeconomic students and native tribal communities in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan. An annual summer program will be established to engage K-12 students in hands-on-learning for understanding of porous materials.<br/><br/>This project will utilize a new concept/methodology, multiscale-driven multiphysics, to tackle the issue which appears difficult to solve with existing methods. The research will first focus on the macroscopic mechanisms underlying thermally induced water flux. For the purpose, thermally induced water flux will be related to the temperature dependence of the contact angle by conducting two sub-tasks: 1. measuring thermally induced water flux with a newly designed research setup, and 2. measuring the contact angle using a modified capillary rise method. Then molecular dynamics analysis will be carried out to reveal the microscopic mechanisms underneath the temperature dependence of the contact angle, which is hypothesized to be attributable to the temperature dependence of vapor adsorption. Finally, adsorption isotherms will be measured to experimentally validate the hypotheses and to couple the frameworks at both macro- and micro-scales, aiming at a physically-based and practically implementable framework for thermally induced water flux. The research is potentially very important as it attempts at breakthroughs via innovations on the theoretical (new theories at both macro and micro-scale), experimental (contact angle and thermally induced flux measurements), and numerical aspects (molecular simulations for water-mineral system).  In the long term, the project also serves as an exploratory effort to examine the concept of multiscale-driven multiphysics, for the purpose of enabling solutions to critical historical issues and pressing challenges arising from upcoming applications in sustainability, energy and environmental protection, which more and more involve non-isothermal behavior of soils, and in a broad sense, multiphysics in porous materials."

DGR is a world-class repository for frozen biological materials representing >200,000 organisms that are digitized and fully searchable on-line. Over 84% are associated with traditional voucher specimens. Dating back to 1979, DGR is the largest wild mammal collection worldwide, and among the top 10 largest bird tissue collections. The facility also houses substantial fish, amphibian and reptile tissues including critical samples from endangered species and threatened ecosystems. DGR is worldwide in scope with excellent representation from North America, Asia, Africa, and throughout Latin America. These specimens provide critical resources for studies of specialized and interdisciplinary studies. Annually > 50 loans of approximately 2000 specimens generate >80 peer-reviewed publications. DGR has held a leadership role in developing connections between the museum community and the molecular genomic efforts. This upgrade to DGR provides a platform to further those efforts, and also leverages the heavy involvement of DGR with municipal, state, and federal agencies, especially in the fields of natural resource management and public and wildlife health. Planned outreach utilizes existing programs at the museum to educate the public, including young students, on the role of collections in the practice of science that benefits society.<br/><br/>This project will create a state-of-the-art facility by replacing the existing electrical (-80C) freezer system with 3 large liquid nitrogen freezers and a nitrogen generator that will significantly increase sample quality by providing much lower archival temperatures (-190C) and much longer protection should there be a catastrophic interruption of power or other emergency. In addition this upgrade will reduce electrical consumption substantially (>60% reduction). All samples to be moved will receive unique barcodes to enable the transfer of associated specimen data into a digital object tracking system and to informatics applications. The associated database, Arctos, has direct links to GenBank (and soon IsoBank) that immediately tie the specimen and associated museum data (spatial, temporal, morphological) to other Big Data on the web. This connection places the museum specimen as the primary nexus that connects not only the publications derived from specimen-based research, but also the increasingly vast amounts of new molecular data derived from each specimen."

The PETRA mission is to promote interdisciplinary research on ways to use pervasive ambient intelligent environments to improve the quality of life and enhance human performance with greater capabilities; it is the only annual conference that brings together theoreticians and practitioners from a wide variety of disciplines to focus on the application of pervasive technologies to assistive environments. Outcomes of this conference have a broad impact in diverse application areas such as manufacturing, transportation, energy systems, security and safety, robotics, healthcare, biomedicine, environment and conservation. PETRA brings together very different types of technologies to also address important social and healthcare issues for sensitive populations, such as the elderly, persons suffering from chronic conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Cerebral Palsy, and other disabilities or traumas. The PETRA proceedings are published in the ACM digital library, and the authors of the best papers are invited to submit to special journal issues after the end of the conference. More information about the conference may be found online at http://www.petrae.org.  The PETRA 2016 Doctoral Consortium will afford student authors of papers accepted for presentation at the conference a unique opportunity to gain additional exposure for their innovative ideas while also receiving reinforcement for the importance and value of conducting research with societal impact. The workshop will allow the junior participants to create a social network both among themselves and with senior colleagues. The organizing committee will make a concerted effort to attract participants who are women, members of under-represented minorities, and persons with disabilities; to further assure diversity, NSF funds will be used to support no more than 2 student participants from any one institution, and if 2 students are supported, one of them must be a minority or person with disability. <br/><br/>The goals of the Doctoral Consortium, which will consist of special sessions at the beginning, during, and at the end of the conference, are to increase the exposure and visibility of the participants' work within the community, to help establish a sense of community among this next generation of researchers, and to help foster their research efforts by providing substantive feedback and guidance in a supportive and interactive environment from a group of senior researchers.  The special program organized for the students includes sessions between the doctoral students and the faculty mentors, in which the students will discuss their work and ask questions; the faculty mentors will provide constructive comments on the students' work and address their questions.  Each student will be asked to submit a report that provides feedback about the conference, regarding the benefits they received, which presentations they liked and why, and how certain papers and topics relate to their work. After they finish the report, students will participate in small group breakout sessions and discuss their report; faculty mentors will ensure that each student participant in the doctoral consortium completes this assignment, and will also provide guidance on how to proceed for further journal publication.  Students will also have the option to submit a poster paper and to attend conference workshops on special topics.  Short papers on the participants' work will be published in the conference proceedings, and a summary report on the event will be posted on the conference website."

Nematodes like C. elegans are ubiquitous in nature, and are important ecologically, agriculturally, and medically. Furthermore, insights gleaned from studies of C. elegans interactions with microbes are broadly applicable to many other animals. The meeting draws scientists from many different disciplines, thus proving fertile ground for new inter-disciplinary collaborations and exchange of cutting-edge ideas. As broader impacts, the Meeting is organized by junior faculty members and provides opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral trainees to present their work, thus providing opportunities for science dissemination and career development, and contributing to a strong U.S. biomedical workforce. The 2016 Meeting provides a novel program, in which break-out sessions are specifically designed to foster communication between distinguished scientists and young trainees. The award will provide support for attendance and presentations by promising young investigators, including women and underrepresented minorities as a focus. In addition dependent day-care will be available on site, which will enhance participation of young investigators, particularly women. NSF-sponsored awards for best poster (undergraduate, graduate, and postdoc categories) and for a new Worm Art show are other key innovations that promote science communication through the visual arts. Results discussed at the meeting will be disseminated to the scientific community by having abstracts accessible online at wormbase.org.<br/><br/>As is clear from a large body of work, Host-Microbe Interactions pervade every aspect of host physiology, including its longevity, ability to confront environmental stress, its metabolism, and its epigenetic gene regulation.

Not so in C. elegans. It is now clear that the insights gleaned from C. elegans host-microbe interaction studies are broadly applicable to many animal species beyond the nematode clade. Comprehensive study of the intricate mechanisms of host-microbe interaction and their consequences on host physiology mandates an experimentally tractable model organism, of which C. elegans is unrivaled. This is the premier meeting focused on host-microbe interactions in stress responses and epigenetics of small RNA in C. elegans."

Results will guide decisions about managing endangered, overabundant, and alien species. The researchers will work with state and local agencies in Wyoming to develop programs to monitor wildlife habitat and nutritional conditions. Results will be communicated to the public in partnership with the Wildlife Migration Initiative.

Investigators will measure abundance of forage plants along with levels of body fat and reproduction, which indicate how much forage is available. Fecal samples from each population will be used to quantify diet.  DNA analyses of feces will identify individual moose and their gender. Measures of plant availability, body fat, reproduction and diet will demonstrate if moose adjust their diets when particular plants becomes scarce. Moose and other large herbivores are ruminants, relying on highly specialized guts that cultivate microbes to digest plant fibers and toxins that other animals cannot. The ability of moose to shift their diets when food becomes scarce may depend on the ability of their gut microbes to accommodate new diets. The alternate hypothesis that will be tested is that moose diets and their gut microbes are inherited and are resistant to changes in food availability. To answer these questions, microbial DNA found in feces will be used to quantify the relationship between gut microbes, the genetic relatedness of individual moose, and moose diets. Results of this project will advance understanding of how food supply drives population increase or decline."

Because the 2-RDM approach is more compact than the many-electron wave function, these methods enable large computations on complex systems that are not possible using conventional approaches.  The theories and algorithms being developed facilitate the discovery and characterization of novel molecules and materials relevant energy conversion, catalysis, and advanced energy storage technologies. Professor DePrince is also developing Chemical Physics courses, a lecture series, and online educational content with the goal of establishing a Chemical Physics PhD track in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry at Florida State University.<br/><br/>The project aims to develop a theoretical and computational framework for the description of electronically excited states in complex systems.  Here, the term complex refers to systems that fall into one of two categories: (i) molecules whose electronic wave functions cannot be described qualitatively by a single electronic configuration (i.e. strongly correlated systems) or (ii) molecules embedded in extreme environments, such as those in the vicinity of a plasmonic nanoparticle, where intense external electric fields can significantly perturb the electron density for the molecule. For the former category, frequency- and time-domain methods are being developed to extract excited-state information from variational two-electron reduced-density matrix (2-RDM)-driven complete active space self-consistent field computations.  For the latter category, the investigator and his group are developing fully-quantum mechanical approaches that simulate plasmon-molecule interactions in the time domain. Because the plasmon is modeled in a quantum-mechanical way, such an approach captures quantum-mechanical effects, such as entanglement and coherences between plasmon excitations. Professor DePrince places the codes developed as part of this research effort in the public domain in either free or commercial electronic structure packages. Making these codes available to the public facilitates the discovery of novel materials and the advancement of the numerical methods developed throughout the project."

Different but closely related species replace each other along environmental gradients (e.g., from dry to wet). In some cases the new species function similarly, but in others species replacements have major impacts on the ecosystem and the goods and services provided to humans. Around the planet, species distributions are shifting in response to a changing climate, yet little is known about how the shifts will affect ecosystems.  One continuous study over the past 25 years of the animals that live in high elevation ponds in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado shows that species are shifting to higher elevations. And at the same elevation animals are moving to different types of ponds (permanent vs. temporary) as the water regime varies.  The goal of this new project is to determine how such shifts impact ecosystem function. Training of undergraduate students is a key component of the project and undergraduates will be involved with all aspects of the research. A cross-institutional research experiment will be developed for them, where they can work together to study the impacts of species range shifts from North Carolina to Maine. One graduate student and a postdoctoral associate will also be trained. Finally, the team will continue public outreach at each home institution, as well as at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Colorado where most of the research will be conducted. <br/><br/>This project will test how range shifts along environmental gradients in the dominant group of detritivores (caddisfly larvae) will affect multiple ecosystem processes, including the transfer of detrital energy to detritivore secondary production, release of detritus-bound nutrients for algal uptake, bottom-up effects of algae on herbivores, and ecosystem metabolism. Researchers will use models, experiments, and comparative data from whole ponds to investigate the degree to which 1) species replacements along permanence and elevational gradients are functional replacements in terms of detritus processing rates and cascading effects on brown (detrital) and green (algal) trophic paths, 2) the interactive effects of species shifts across the permanence gradient within an elevation and those associated with range shifts across elevations, and 3) how changes in ecosystem processes with community rearrangements scale up to natural ponds. Impacts will be assessed on three components: 1) the amounts of nutrients and energy from dead plant parts that are eaten by animals (detritivory), 2) how much of the consumption is released back into the environment and stimulates the growth of algae, which can then also be eaten, and 3) how new combinations of species affect the overall productivity of the ponds."

Moreover, recent studies show that geothermal heating is an important driver of deep ocean circulation, which is a major component of the ocean-atmosphere system.  As a part of a large multidisciplinary and international research program, this project will develop the first high-resolution models of how crustal heat and mass transfer impact deep ocean circulation. The proposed work will lead to a better understanding of deep ocean circulation and its connection with the global ocean-atmosphere system. The proposed work also will yield an important advance in understanding how crustal heat and mass transfer evolves as the oceanic crust ages.  The project supports the training of graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The proposed research forms an integral component of the large multi-disciplinary, multi-institutional project led by the University of Durham, England.  This research will use recently collected physical oceanographic, geophysical, and conductive heat flow data, together with existing data sets from the Panama Basin in the equatorial Pacific Ocean, to construct hydrothermal heat and mass flux models from the Costa Rica Rift (CRR) axis to sediment-covered, 6 million year old crust.  The goals are: (1) to understand how hydrothermal heat transfer evolves with crustal structure as the lithospheric ages; and (2) to develop high resolution models that show how hydrothermal heat and mass transfer impacts deep ocean circulation on a regional scale.  To achieve these goals, 85 new conductive heat flow measurements have been obtained in sediment-covered crust at ages between 1.3 and 5.3 Ma co-located with a multi-channel seismic line.  These data will be used together with existing heat flow data, and the geophysical and oceanographic data from the British-led project, to construct mathematical and numerical models of hydrothermal heat transfer in young sediment-covered crust. In addition, other geophysical data on the distribution of melt and partial melt in axial and near-axial regions, coupled with water samples for helium analysis and oceanographic data characterizing the ocean bottom boundary layer and hydrothermal plume structure at the CRR, will constrain models of hydrothermal circulation at the ridge axis and in near-axial regions. These analyses will provide the first estimates of hydrothermal heat output at the CRR and near-axis region, and will guide future exploration of hydrothermal activity, geochemical transport, and the biological communities at the CRR. Finally, the hydrothermal models will serve as input to high-resolution models of ocean circulation using the detailed suite of oceanographic data collected during the British-led project."

Short course topics will include preparing graduate students for academic careers in the earth sciences, preparation of samples for analysis by electron backscatter detection (EBSD) methods, teaching structural geology and tectonics, quantitative and statistical treatment of structural geology data, new methods of constructing balanced geological cross sections, and analysis of geologic and tectonics structures using finite element modeling. <br/><br/>The forum is designed to facilitate community building and personal interaction within different segments of the structural geology community. It will bring together faculty from research universities, liberal arts colleges, community and two-year colleges, and minority-serving institutions. Importantly, there will be group discussions on critical developments in structural geology and tectonics, and what future research priorities should be. This community building effort will help create a stronger, more vibrant group of scientists and help introduce graduate students and advanced undergraduates to the structural geology and tectonics disciplines. The setting will be particularly useful for graduate students, who will be able to use the venue and informal nature of the forum to find out what research is taking place at other institutions, meet a wide range of faculty, and develop useful contacts which will be of great value to their future careers. Students will also be able to present their own work in a friendly environment where they can obtain thoughtful and useful feedback, as well as providing opportunity to build new scientific collaborations. Abstracts, field guides, and short course notes will be disseminated through a dedicated website that will be publicly accessible."

This type of social system, called cooperative breeding, is frequently associated with monogamy across a diversity of animal groups. This association is thought to result from the fact that helpers in monogamous groups share on average 50% of their genes with their full siblings - the same proportion they share with their own offspring. Therefore, from a gene's eye view, helping can be as good a strategy as reproducing independently when helpers can assist in rearing full siblings. Although staying near home to help can be beneficial in some circumstances, the benefits of cooperating could be reduced or even cancelled out if helpers find themselves competing with close relatives for resources when they do not disperse from the area where they were born. This project investigates the contexts in which cooperation and competition occur to determine if animals can balance these costs and benefits through dispersal behavior. This proposal also tests a novel alternative explanation for the observed association between monogamy and cooperation, asking whether this relationship could be due to environmental factors that similarly influence both mate fidelity and helping behavior. The role of sibling relatedness in the evolution of cooperation is of major interest in the field of behavioral evolution, and the studies proposed here could have profound influences on our understanding of family-based cooperative societies, such as our own. The project will also provide multiple training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in a range of modern scientific skills, including the use of the most cutting edge DNA sequencing techniques. The work will be shared with the public through a community science festival and scientific illustration classes.<br/><br/>This research investigates the relationship between mating systems and social systems using cooperative bess beetles as a model organism. First, fine-scale population structure will be assessed to test the hypothesis that beetles cooperate locally within their highly related family group before dispersing to compete globally with unrelated individuals, allowing them to avoid the costs of competing with kin while maximizing the benefits of cooperating with relatives. The second objective in this study will test the novel hypothesis that certain environments may favor both monogamy and cooperation simultaneously, leading to a correlation between mating and social system that is consequential rather than causal. Conceptually, this hypothesis suggests that the terms in Hamilton's Rule (rB-C>0) may covary in certain environments. Specifically, this study will test whether a single ecological factor, low resource density, reduces the costs (C) of helping (by increasing the costs of dispersal) while simultaneously increasing the relatedness between helpers and their siblings (r) by reducing extra-pair paternity. To assess this possibility, paternity and dispersal will be investigated in response to resource density in both natural and experimental populations of bess beetles. The results of this study could suggest that the terms in Hamilton?s Rule are not modular, but rather covary under certain conditions, changing the way we understand both the correlated evolution of social and mating systems as well as the association between relatedness and cooperation."

Different but closely related species replace each other along environmental gradients (e.g., from dry to wet). In some cases the new species function similarly, but in others species replacements have major impacts on the ecosystem and the goods and services provided to humans. Around the planet, species distributions are shifting in response to a changing climate, yet little is known about how the shifts will affect ecosystems.  One continuous study over the past 25 years of the animals that live in high elevation ponds in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado shows that species are shifting to higher elevations. And at the same elevation animals are moving to different types of ponds (permanent vs. temporary) as the water regime varies.  The goal of this new project is to determine how such shifts impact ecosystem function. Training of undergraduate students is a key component of the project and undergraduates will be involved with all aspects of the research. A cross-institutional research experiment will be developed for them, where they can work together to study the impacts of species range shifts from North Carolina to Maine. One graduate student and a postdoctoral associate will also be trained. Finally, the team will continue public outreach at each home institution, as well as at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Colorado where most of the research will be conducted. <br/><br/>This project will test how range shifts along environmental gradients in the dominant group of detritivores (caddisfly larvae) will affect multiple ecosystem processes, including the transfer of detrital energy to detritivore secondary production, release of detritus-bound nutrients for algal uptake, bottom-up effects of algae on herbivores, and ecosystem metabolism. Researchers will use models, experiments, and comparative data from whole ponds to investigate the degree to which 1) species replacements along permanence and elevational gradients are functional replacements in terms of detritus processing rates and cascading effects on brown (detrital) and green (algal) trophic paths, 2) the interactive effects of species shifts across the permanence gradient within an elevation and those associated with range shifts across elevations, and 3) how changes in ecosystem processes with community rearrangements scale up to natural ponds. Impacts will be assessed on three components: 1) the amounts of nutrients and energy from dead plant parts that are eaten by animals (detritivory), 2) how much of the consumption is released back into the environment and stimulates the growth of algae, which can then also be eaten, and 3) how new combinations of species affect the overall productivity of the ponds."

We still do not understand the general principles that link specific neural response properties with the structure of behaviorally relevant signals. This project will address this question by comparing how the brain encodes communication signals several closely related species of electric fish that display key differences in their signals. The project will use neurophysiological experiments, behavioral assays, and signal analysis to ask how brain mechanisms are optimized to species-specific signal properties and how these neural mechanisms influence the ability of the animals to perceive signals. The project will test the hypothesis that the structure of communication signals and the patterns of neural responses are efficiently matched across species to enable to detect and/or the discriminate conspecific signals. The model system, the communication signals of weakly electric fishes, is an ideal platform to link evolutionary, neurophysiological, and computational approaches to understanding the neural basis of behavior.  Furthermore, electric fishes' use of a ""sixth sense"" to detect their world and communicate is a fascinating phenomenon that can engage public interest in animal diversity and neurobiology. The project will train high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. The researchers will also work with K-12 teachers to develop lesson plans that are linked to the project?s research and that are aligned with the learning goals of the AP Biology curriculum.<br/><br/>Communication signals often evolve with peripheral sensory filters to optimize species-specific signal capture. Much less is known, however, about how central sensory circuits evolve to efficiently extract and analyze complex features of conspecific signals. This project will comparatively study the communication signals and sensory systems of weakly electric fish to investigate relationships between signal structure, neural mechanisms of sensory processing, and perceptual tasks. The central hypothesis is that sensory coding and signal structure co-evolve in response to perceptual demands to permit efficient detection and discrimination of conspecific signals. The project will first analyze how cross-species variation in the structure of two communication signals that impinge on the same sensory channel influences the conspicuousness of signals. The project will then use in vivo electrophysiology to compare how the coding strategies of central sensory neurons are related to the structure of signals across species. Finally, behavioral tests will quantify how signal structure and sensory coding strategies influence the abilities of the fish to detect and discriminate signals. The project thus explicitly links signal diversity, sensory systems, and behavior. This project has strong potential to open a new direction in studying the mechanisms and evolution of communication systems by revealing how complex features of species-specific signals are co-adapted with neural coding strategies and the sensory tasks they accomplish. The CoPIs will take advantage of the interdisciplininary approaches of the project and the charismatic and engaging nature of the animal model to provide outreach and educational opportunities from the K-12 to advanced graduate levels."

However, these I/O devices, if exploited by attackers, can pose severe security and privacy threats to smartphone users. The root cause of these threats is that smartphone device I/Os carry important and sensitive user information, but currently there lack systematic approaches to protect these device I/Os. This research will investigate the system design and prototype implementation towards enabling secure and trusted device I/Os on smartphones. <br/><br/>This project will address the following three objectives with the proposed system, named IOGuard: 1) Securing device inputs: IOGuard aims to secure smartphone device inputs such that attackers cannot infer or steal user sensitive info from device inputs. 2) Enabling trusted device inputs: IOGuard aims to provide protected applications with the guarantee that the device inputs delivered to the applications are authentic and have not been tampered with. 3) Providing trusted screen outputs: IOGuard aims to enable trusted screen outputs for protected applications to defend against UI spoofing/activity hijacking attacks. This project aims at achieving the above objectives with practical and scalable solutions, which support running both unmodified smartphone operating systems and unmodified applications with good system performance and user experience. Specifically, support of unmodified operating systems will be achieved by a small and dedicated bare-metal hypervisor built using the recently introduced ARM hardware virtualization technology. Support of unmodified applications will be achieved by a novel user-space sandbox framework. A series of novel designs will also be carried out and evaluated to enable smooth system integration and good system performance.  <br/><br/>This project will bring an effective, practical, and deployment-scalable solution that could benefit billions of smartphone users and many mobile services.

Colonies, like individuals, have a cycle of growth and development. When a colony transitions between developmental stages, the workers must coordinate the transition. The goal of this project is to understand the cues that non-reproductive worker honey bees use to detect the developmental stage of their colony and coordinate the switch between producing more workers and producing reproductive males and females (drones and queens). This research will encourage collaboration between researchers studying animal behavior, chemical ecology, and electrical engineering. Current methods used by beekeepers to assess the strength and developmental stage of a honey bee colony are based on metrics that humans can easily determine, but are almost certainly not those used by the bees. Honey bees are the primary pollinator of agricultural crops worldwide, providing billions of dollars of pollination services. By identifying the metrics that bees use to detect their own colony's development, this research will help beekeepers determine which colonies need to be managed, and when.  Better colony management can in turn improve crop production. The outcomes of this research will be shared through beekeeping classes. This project will also train graduate and undergraduate researchers in behavioral ecology, chemical ecology and engineering.<br/><br/>Descriptive work has shown that social insect colonies invest first in workers (for growth) and then switch to producing reproductive individuals. Theoretical work has shown why colonies invest as they do, but it is unknown how developmental transitions are coordinated. The researchers recently discovered that a threshold number of workers is the trigger that induces honey bee colonies to invest in reproduction, but how workers detect this reproductive threshold is unknown. The goal of this research is to test two hypotheses of the mechanism by which individual honey bees assess their colony?s size: (1) beeswax comb vibrations, and (2) volatile chemical compounds. Using accelerometers to measure comb vibrations, and gas chromatography to analyze chemical compounds, the researchers will determine whether these cues reliably change with colony size. The cues will then be experimentally manipulated, to determine which one(s) the workers use to detect that their colony is above the reproductive threshold. Understanding the cues that superorganisms use to coordinate their developmental transitions will give insights into how evolution has solved similar problems at different levels of biological organization such as individuals and societies."

For example, an electron (one of the particles that make up atoms) can be at multiple locations at the same time and can tunnel through a barrier--something forbidden by the classical laws of physics. The theory that explains these counterintuitive behaviors of small particles is ""quantum mechanics"". This CAREER project will investigate the possibility of making quantum mechanics appear manifest in larger, more macroscopic, systems.  In specific, the project will investigate how to couple the spin of an electron to the motion of a nanoparticle (containing millions of atoms). The nanoparticle will be levitated by a laser beam in vacuum to avoid perturbations from the environment. This system should serve as a very sensitive force detector with many applications.  It may enable other experiments to study the conflict between general relativity and quantum mechanics, a longstanding problem in physics. The research will be integrated with several related educational activities, including direct training of graduate and undergraduate students participating in the research, and conducting inquiry workshops about infrared light for middle and high school teachers and students. Infrared light is not visible to human eyes, but plays a crucial role in global warming and fiber-optic communication.  In the present work, infrared light will be used to levitate nanoparticles in vacuum. After doing hands-on experiments with infrared light in the workshop, teachers will be able to take their apparatus for use in their classrooms.<br/><br/>In more technical detail, this research project will develop a system that combines the advantages of both trapped atoms and conventional optomechanical systems for studying macroscopic quantum mechanics: an optically levitated nanodiamond with a built-in nitrogen-vacancy (NV) center. In some ways, this system can be considered to be an ""artificial atom"" with a very large mass. The electron spin of the NV center can be coupled to the motion of the nanodiamond with a magnetic field gradient. This coupling can be used to create large quantum spatial superposition states of the nanodiamond, which will lead to the development of a nanoparticle matter-wave interferometer for fundamental tests of quantum mechanics in unexplored parameter regimes. The main focus of this CAREER project will be to experimentally study the coupling between an NV electron spin and both the center-of-mass motion and the rotation of an optically levitated nanodiamond. The motion of the levitated nanodiamond will be cooled to near quantum ground state by active feedback cooling. The NV electron spin will be used to sense and manipulate the motion of the nanodiamond. It will also be used to measure the internal temperature of the levitated nanodiamond which affects the quantum coherence time."

As a biodiversity hotspot, tropical coral reefs achieve much of their success and diversity from a network of multi-level symbioses. Although this reliance on symbiosis is well recognized, we know very little about how genetic diversity evolves within a symbiotic marine framework. Namely, our expectations surrounding resource specialization and co-diversification come primarily from the terrestrially biased literature, whereas discordant land-sea processes that act at the population level may lead to different outcomes. This research will test evolutionary hypotheses surrounding symbiosis and resource specialization by studying multiple crustacean species that all live on the corkscrew sea anemone on Caribbean coral reefs, yet vary in their host specificity. Using genomic DNA sequencing, the researchers will identify and describe previously unrecognized cryptic species, test whether increased host specificity leads to more incidences of speciation, and whether patterns of co-evolution can be recovered among these symbionts across the entire Caribbean. This research will train one graduate student and provide undergraduate students with research opportunities in the marine and molecular evolutionary sciences. Educational materials will be developed to demonstrate co-evolutionary principles in undergraduate biology courses, and public outreach events will target the ornamental aquarium trade as all study species are collected commercially.<br/><br/>Resource specialization is expected to leave a strong signature on the genome and play an important role in species diversification. Species with narrow ecological requirements are expected to have smaller, more fragmented habitats, smaller effective population sizes, and ultimately, reduced neutral genetic variation compared to generalists. These expectations are broadly referred to as the specialist-generalist variation hypothesis (SGVH) and are an extension of classic population genetics theory. Within a symbiotic framework, host specificity should be especially useful for testing the expectations of the SGVH because micro-evolutionary processes coupled with symbiotic association will impact the population and evolutionary dynamics of each symbiont. Symbiosis generates an a priori expectation of shared biogeographic history and co-diversification, but variation in host specificity may lead to vastly different demographic histories and evolutionary responses to historical environmental conditions. Thus, the comparison of symbiotic taxa can potentially disentangle the extrinsic forces that effect whole communities from the intrinsic aspects of species biology, shed light on co-evolutionary processes and the emergence of the symbiosis. This research will use high-throughput genomic DNA sequencing and model-based coalescent analyses to delimit and describe cryptic crustacean lineages, examine the role of specialism and generalism on the evolution of genetic diversity, and explore patterns of co-diversification, demographic expansion, and community level phylogeographic breaks across the tropical Western Atlantic. This study will expand the taxonomic scope of the tropical, marine, phylogeographic literature and provide insight into the evolutionary processes that act on marine symbioses."

Each of these organisms, from bacteria to butterflies to bison, best contribute to these services when they consume a healthy diet, which includes access to minerals, especially sodium. Sodium is a critical mineral for ecosystems because plants are generally low in sodium but the things that eat them, from fungi to grasshoppers, require it to grow and reproduce.  Thus every plant eater must search out, harvest, and hang onto quantities of sodium, and will go to extremes eating carcasses, soil, and urine, to get that quota. Moreover, sodium is not uniformly distributed on the landscape.  It falls as dilute ocean water near the coasts, it clings to clay soils but is leached from sandy soils, and it is distributed by the truckload to keep snowy roads free from ice. This project combines these two facts, that sodium is potentially one of the most important drivers of the health of plant consumers, and that sodium is geographically patchy, to predict the abundance and services of plant consumers across the North American continent. This research should lead to better prediction of such disparate phenomena as why grasshoppers are bigger crop pests in one county than another; why carbon is better stored in inland soils than those near the ocean; and why termite damage claims are centered along the Gulf Coast of the U.S. and up into the Mid-Atlantic states.<br/><br/>To evaluate this proposition, the project combines two methods. The first maps the distribution of sodium across and within North American ecosystems and focuses on the easily accessible and widespread grasslands, old fields, and roadsides, and the invertebrates that live in them. The goal in Year 1 is to explore the basic hypothesis that as soil supplies of sodium increase - due to deposition from the ocean, high clay content, or because they are salted every winter - plants will not be affected but the animals that eat them (and the predators that eat the plant consumers) will. Thus the first year will generate a map of the abundance and activity of invertebrates above and belowground, and the degree to which both track sodium supply (and other nutrients). Then, in Year 2 and 3, these correlations will be put to the test experimentally in 6 grasslands from the central and eastern U.S. At each grassland, 50 meter square plots will be fertilized with a dilute sodium concentrations mimicking the slightly salty rainfall of the island of Puerto Rico; smaller plots will receive sodium mimicking that deposited on a regular basis by every animal as urine. By carefully tracking where the sodium goes, and how it boosts the numbers and activity of invertebrates, the project will test how animal health and vigor across North America is influenced by sodium supply. By examining how pollinators, herbivores, and detritivores respond, the project will test the transformative idea that sodium is a catalyst for ecosystem services."

While this capability of the material has been demonstrated experimentally, the mechanisms responsible for it are not well understood. Consequently, current mathematical models of this material fail to predict power output accurately, hampering the development and optimization of magnetic shape memory alloy based power harvesters. Successful completion of this work will significantly deepen understanding of this new material and could lead to new technologies to power, or power assist, sensors deployable in remote locations (e.g. to monitor forest conditions) or in infrastructure (e.g. to monitor operational safety).<br/><br/>The main objectives of this project are to understand the underlying microstructural mechanisms occurring in magnetic shape memory alloys during power harvesting and to mathematically embed these mechanisms into a material constitutive model that accurately predicts change in magnetization, power output, and strain. In order to understand the mechanisms that lead to power harvesting with these materials, microscopic observations will be performed simultaneously with macroscopic magneto-mechanical characterization; this will allow for the two scales to be correlated. Observations about changes in the microstructure, during various loadings, will be incorporated into a thermodynamics based constitutive model of the material. The model will be validated against macroscopic magnetization, magnetic field, strain, stress, and power data obtained experimentally, under a wide variety of magneto-mechanical loading conditions. Understanding of the underlying mechanisms causing power harvesting, including the magneto-mechanical interdependencies, and embedding these mechanisms into a constitutive model will be a major advance in the field and will yield knowledge that can be employed to develop new technologies with this material and may be extended to understand and model other adaptive or magnetically active materials."

However, it is difficult to fabricate them using traditional machining techniques, due to the brittle nature and low thermal conductivity often found in transparent materials. Femtosecond pulsed lasers offer the potential to overcome these difficulties. However, the aspect ratio and quality of microchannels produced by femtosecond pulsed lasers are limited. This award supports fundamental research to enable significant improvement in the quality and aspect ratio of microchannels produced by femtosecond pulsed lasers.<br/><br/>The research objectives are to establish the relationships between (1) ablation mechanisms (spallation, phase explosion, fragmentation, etc.) and machining conditions (laser intensity, pulse duration, etc.); (2) ablation mechanisms and ejected particle size/velocity distributions; and (3) the size/velocity of an ejected particle and its capability of escaping a long channel. To achieve the first two objectives, a physics-based atomistic model, consisting of a molecular dynamics method, a Monte Carlo method, and a particle-in-cell method, will be developed, with laser parameters and material properties as the inputs. By predicting the distributions of temperature, pressure, and electric field within the materials, dominating ablation mechanisms will be revealed under different machining conditions. This model will also predict the sizes and velocities of the ejected particles by simulating the atom evolution during the laser-matter interaction. To verify the simulation outputs, the sizes/velocities of the ejected particles under the same conditions will be experimentally measured by the time-resolved pump-probe imaging technique. To achieve the third objective, outputs of the atomistic model, such as the temperature, pressure, and the sizes/velocities of the ejected particles after the initial laser-matter interaction, will be used as inputs into a subsequently developed smooth particle hydrodynamics model,  to simulate the ejected particle evolution within the channel in a large time scale. For particles with given sizes and initial velocities, the model will predict their escape or redeposition onto the channel side walls, based on the temperature, pressure, and ambient environment inside the channel. Ejected particle moving dynamics, such as their transient locations and velocities, will also be observed in-situ using the time-resolved pump-probe imaging technique, and compared with model simulation results."

It has been estimated that, in the United States alone, soil salinity reduces irrigated crop yields by 20-30% annually. With few exceptions, crop plants are unable to adapt to the stresses induced by elevated levels of salt in the soil. While genetic variation for plant growth in salinity (salt tolerance) exists, little is known about the genes underlying this variation. Two copies of a calcium sensor gene has been found in the plant species Eutrema salsugineum, while many related species have only one copy. Because Eutrema is able to grow in high salt soils that kill most, if not all crop plants, the duplication of this gene provides a unique opportunity to link its function to plant salt tolerance.  To do this, the project will uncover how and when the functions of the original and duplicate genes diverged and identify the physiological changes that resulted.  In addition, this project will be used to enhance the infrastructure of research, training, and outreach through the continued education and training of students and postdoctoral researchers at the University of Arizona, design of simple research modules for largely minority-serving K-12 classrooms in the Tucson area, and participation in outreach efforts to K-12 students and the community in Southern Arizona.<br/><br/>Gene duplication is a major source of genetic diversity and, consequently, adaptive evolution.  Because most duplicated genes are lost via pseudogenization, the maintenance of duplicated gene pairs in a genome can be indicative of an adaptive benefit conferred by the paralogous genes.  The CBL10 calcium sensor is present as a single gene in the salt-sensitive model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), but as two genes in its salt-tolerant relative, Eutrema (both members of the Brassicaceae).  This project will use the genetic and genomic resources developed for Arabidopsis to determine how new traits and phenotypes emerge from a gene duplication event and contribute to plant adaptation.  Specifically, characterization of Eutrema with reduced expression of the CBL10 genes will determine their specific functions in salt tolerance (Aim 1). Functional analysis of CBL10 homologs from closely related species within the Brassicaceae will determine when the duplicated Eutrema genes acquired the changes that led to their functional divergence (Aim 2). Analyses of CBL10 protein sequences and biochemical activities will identify domains that underlie the differences in Eutrema CBL10 function and the associated physiological mechanisms (Aim 3)."

For many applications it is important to make such polymeric materials within extremely tight spaces, even down to the nanoscale (i.e. to thicknesses about 10,000 times smaller than the thickness of a human hair).  This process is called nanoconfinement.  In this project, polymerization under nanoconfinement will be studied and theoretical predictions will be tested.   The results of the research are important for a fundamental understanding of confined polymerization in nanoelectronic and nanolithography processes, and thus could facilitate technological advances important to these industries.  In addition, the results have implications for understanding biopolymers and proteins in biological systems where, for example, protein polymerization can occur in confined environments.  The project includes the training of one graduate student, one postdoctoral researcher, and an undergraduate researcher in cutting-edge research involving polymer chemistry and physics at the nanoscale.  Ethics training will be incorporated into the training of the students.  The PI has a strong track record working with minority and female students, and a vigorous effort will similarly be made to include underrepresented students in this project.  Outreach will include organization of two one-week-long polymer modules for the TTU program, ""Science -- It's a Girl Thing,"" for girls in junior high school, and the development of four two-hour modules for the TTU Super Saturdays science program for 4th to 6th graders.     <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The fundamental question of entropy loss on confining a chain to a nanopore is addressed, and theories for the scaling of confinement entropy with chain size and nanoconfinement size and dimension will be tested.  The entropy loss on confining a chain to a nanopore will be directly determined from the difference in the entropy change on reaction in nanoconfined and bulk conditions.  The research focuses on nanoconfined free radical n-alkyl methacrylate polymerizations since the thermodynamics of these systems in the bulk case are well understood.  Monomer/polymer equilibria will be studied using calorimetry as a function of reaction temperature and confinement conditions, ranging from weak confinement for dilute solutions in large cylindrical pores to strong confinement for undiluted monomer in small spherical cavities.  Monomer and initiator concentrations will be varied to change molecular weight independent of pore size and reaction temperature, whereas pore surface chemistry and monomer structure will be varied to change interfacial interactions. In addition, comparisons will be made with nanoparticle-filled systems having similar surface to volume ratios as the nanoporous matrices but without the chain confining constraints."

Despite their tremendous benefits, distributed sensing systems pose great new research challenges, of which one important facet stems from the conflicts between the Quality of Information (QoI) provided by the sensor nodes and the consumption of system and network resources. On one hand, individual sensors are not reliable, due to various reasons such as incomplete observations, background noise, and poor sensor quality. To address this problem, a possible solution is to integrate information from multiple sensors that observe the same events, as this will likely cancel out the errors of individual sensors. On the other hand, distributed sensing systems usually have limited resources (e.g., bandwidth, energy, storage, etc). Therefore, it is usually prohibitive to collect data from a large number of sensors due to the potential excessive resource consumption. Targeting on this challenge, this project seeks to develop a resource-efficient information integration framework that can intelligently integrate information from distributed sensors so that the highest quality of information can be achieved, under the constraint of system resources. Successful completion of the proposed research will benefit a wide spectrum of applications that rely on distributed sensing systems for the collection, transmission and analysis of sensory data.<br/><br/>This project aims to make several contributions in this area of research. First, it will develop a novel information integration algorithm that can jointly estimate the QoI of each sensor and integrate the information provided by the sensors. This algorithm puts more weights on the sensors with high QoIs, and thus can achieve improved accuracy than the straightforward integration methods such as averaging and voting that treat all the sensors equally. Second, to address the challenge brought by the constrained system resources, this project will propose a set of QoI-aware resource allocation mechanisms for the data collection on different types of distributed sensing systems. For physical sensing systems that are usually wireless systems deployed at remote, harsh or even hostile locations, an optimization framework will be developed to maximally utilize the network bandwidth as well as renewable energy in order to achieve the optimal aggregate quality of delivered information. For crowd sensing systems where data collections are carried out by a human population, a novel incentive mechanism will be designed to compensate participants' resource consumption and potential privacy breach, based on not only the efforts a user has spent but also the QoI the user can provide."

Migratory species are declining worldwide due to human disturbance, habitat loss, and climate change. In the presence of these ongoing changes, the ecology of migration has become an important management issue. This research extends a 15-year study of elk to understand why, across migratory species, there are individuals that migrate and those that do not migrate within a single population. The project will help understand the causes of migratory decision-making among elk and the implications of altered migratory behavior for elk conservation and management. The researchers will engage graduate students in journalism, who will develop diverse media outlets to communicate results broadly, and in geography, who will develop web interfaces for the public to view elk migration virtually. The project will offer internships to Native American students through the Native American Natural Resource Program at the University of Montana. General fascination with migratory animals along with the broad appeal of elk to conservationists, hunters, and Native Americans alike promise effective citizen outreach and engagement. <br/><br/>The researchers will use a partly-migratory population of elk as a model system to understand the context-dependent costs and benefits of partial migration.  The project builds on long-term knowledge of the demography of more than 300 individually marked female elk of known age, individual reproductive rates, and juvenile survival rates, combined with spatial analyses of migratory behavior measured by Global Positioning System (GPS) collars. The researchers will monitor both intrinsic factors such as age and reproductive history and extrinsic factors such as forage and predation risk to test competing and interacting hypotheses to understand why a long-lived mammal switches between migratory strategies in the face of environmental change. They will next incorporate results on the causes of switching into a population model that explicitly tests for the effects of switching on population dynamics. A Bayesian state-space population model, Bayesian model selection, and cross-validation of competing models with and without different switching functions will test between two alternate hypotheses for the population dynamic effects of partial migration as well as the relative importance of bottom-up (forage) versus top-down (predation) forces on population growth rates."

The technique, often called 3D printing, offers several advantages over traditional manufacturing, and has the potential to revolutionize the way things are made. However, to fully exploit additive manufacturing, new design methods are needed. This award supports fundamental research towards developing a design framework for additive manufacturing. The design framework will not only consider traditional performance metrics but also additive manufacturing constraints. Specifically, the award will focus on the reduction of the sacrificial support structures needed to additively manufacture parts with geometric overhangs. By departing from conventional practice for support-structure design, the project's integrated approach will lead to low-cost products, benefitting the U.S. economy and society. Developing the framework involves several disciplines including design, manufacturing, and computer science. The research will help broaden participation of underrepresented groups and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>This research will leverage topology optimization theory to integrate performance metrics and additive manufacturing constraints. For example, it will help minimize the compliance of the part, while respecting support structure constraints. The framework will be sufficiently general to accommodate a variety of performance metrics such as compliance, stress, and buckling, and a variety of additive manufacturing constraints such as support structures, surface roughness, and fabrication time. Robust level-set methods of topology optimization will be combined with augmented Lagrangian formulations to create a design framework that will then be integrated into these existing computer aided design systems and made available to the public. Experimental calibration and validation will be carried out to support the theory. The focus will largely be on polymer fused deposition modeling since this process is both inexpensive and easily accessible. However, experiments will also be carried out on metal additive manufacturing to establish the broader implications of the findings."

Research results can help in making electric vehicles cost-competitive with gasoline powered vehicles, thereby reducing the greenhouse gas emissions. This will have a broad and lasting impact on the environment. The research will also benefit the Internet of Things, the healthcare, and the consumer electronics industry, because many applications need robust and high capacity batteries.  In addition, this project will help train US workforce in the interdisciplinary areas of energy, advanced materials, and advanced manufacturing through the development of interdisciplinary curricula and various science activities for diverse youth. <br/><br/>This research focuses on making 3D electrodes using an aerosol jet-based additive manufacturing method along with nanoparticle sintering. The first research objective is to establish relationships between process parameters and the quality of 3D electrode architecture produced by the processes. Process parameters of aerosol jet-based additive manufacturing include carrier gas pressure, and nanoparticle size and dispersion; and sintering process parameters include sintering energy and time. The quality of 3D electrode architecture will be measured in terms of porosity level, pore geometry, specific capacity, and resistance to capacity fade. This objective will be achieved by carrying out experimental research guided by theoretical models. The solidification of nanoparticle solutions upon dispense and the consecutive sintering process will be modelled by using a discretized particle model and a diffusive model. Further, a model that solves the Li diffusion equation coupled with stress evolution and the cracking in the porous electrode will be developed using a multi-scale modeling approach. These models will guide the additive fabrication experiments using high specific capacity materials such as silicon and silicon dioxide. The second objective is to identify relationships between the characteristics of an artificial coating on the electrode and the resistance to electrode capacity fade. The characteristics of the coating include the thickness and uniformity of the coated layer. To achieve this objective, atomic layer deposition will be used to create an electrode-electrolyte interface layer over the 3D porous electrodes. Several microscopic analyses such as atomic force microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and transmission electron microscopy will be used to measure the coating thickness and uniformity. Battery electrochemical experiments will then be carried out and the resistance to capacity fade will be measured using cyclic voltammetry and impedance spectroscopy."

This study will investigate the genetic basis of sexual development in two species of fish. In most animals, sex is predetermined by genetics, established during development, and is fixed for life. This pattern is not true, however, for numerous fish species that exhibit the remarkable ability to change their functional sex (referred to as hermaphroditism). Individuals are neither female nor male and can shift between producing both sperm and eggs as adults. We know very little about the genetic bases of shifting sexual function. Understanding the ability of hermaphroditic fishes to produce new tissues for generating sperm and ova  throughout their lives could provide vital information for solving fertility issues in humans, who do not have this ability. In addition, based on the findings, the researchers will provide classroom material for elementary and middle school students.<br/><br/>Sequential hermaphroditism, the ability to transition between gamete types at some point in adult life, is a widespread strategy among teleost fishes. This study aims to understand the development, evolution and diversification of shifts in sexual function in the marine fish family Gobiidae. This family is an ideal system in which to explore both the evolution and development of sexual plasticity, as hermaphroditism has arisen independently as many as five times. The study will compare two species, Eviota epiphanes with Lythrypnus dalliI. Histological techniques will be used to generate a morphological time series of fish gonads as they transition from ova to sperm production and sequence the whole transcriptome (RNAseq) of brain and gonadal tissue as they transition. These data will be used to construct gene coexpression networks that will be compared between the two species. The results will provide insight into the gene regulatory pathways that govern the sex change process and be used to test for evolutionary conservation or change in those pathways."

Different but closely related species replace each other along environmental gradients (e.g., from dry to wet). In some cases the new species function similarly, but in others species replacements have major impacts on the ecosystem and the goods and services provided to humans. Around the planet, species distributions are shifting in response to a changing climate, yet little is known about how the shifts will affect ecosystems.  One continuous study over the past 25 years of the animals that live in high elevation ponds in the Rocky Mountains of Colorado shows that species are shifting to higher elevations. And at the same elevation animals are moving to different types of ponds (permanent vs. temporary) as the water regime varies.  The goal of this new project is to determine how such shifts impact ecosystem function. Training of undergraduate students is a key component of the project and undergraduates will be involved with all aspects of the research. A cross-institutional research experiment will be developed for them, where they can work together to study the impacts of species range shifts from North Carolina to Maine. One graduate student and a postdoctoral associate will also be trained. Finally, the team will continue public outreach at each home institution, as well as at the Rocky Mountain Biological Laboratory in Colorado where most of the research will be conducted. <br/><br/>This project will test how range shifts along environmental gradients in the dominant group of detritivores (caddisfly larvae) will affect multiple ecosystem processes, including the transfer of detrital energy to detritivore secondary production, release of detritus-bound nutrients for algal uptake, bottom-up effects of algae on herbivores, and ecosystem metabolism. Researchers will use models, experiments, and comparative data from whole ponds to investigate the degree to which 1) species replacements along permanence and elevational gradients are functional replacements in terms of detritus processing rates and cascading effects on brown (detrital) and green (algal) trophic paths, 2) the interactive effects of species shifts across the permanence gradient within an elevation and those associated with range shifts across elevations, and 3) how changes in ecosystem processes with community rearrangements scale up to natural ponds. Impacts will be assessed on three components: 1) the amounts of nutrients and energy from dead plant parts that are eaten by animals (detritivory), 2) how much of the consumption is released back into the environment and stimulates the growth of algae, which can then also be eaten, and 3) how new combinations of species affect the overall productivity of the ponds."

The structure and complexity of ecological communities is shaped by the joint evolution of interacting species. Negative interactions, like predator-prey relationships, are often characterized by sustained and rapid adaptation; each species must constantly adapt and counter-adapt to the co-evolving defenses of its natural enemy. Theory predicts that migration and the exchange of genetic material among populations (a process called gene flow) will have two important, yet conflicting, effects on local adaptation to antagonistic interactions. Gene flow is generally thought to homogenize genetic variation among populations and hinder local adaptation. Conversely, gene flow and migration may play a critical role to spread beneficial mutations to new populations and promote rapid adaptive change. This research will form a foundation for understanding the genetic impetus behind sustained, and often rapid, evolutionary changes that are responsible for the tremendous diversity of complex traits that span predator-prey, host-parasite, and plant-animal systems. In addition, this study will contribute to the training of graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>In western North America, garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) have evolved resistance to tetrodotoxin (TTX), an otherwise lethal neurotoxin found in the newts. Highly resistant snake populations tend to co-occur with highly toxic newts (Taricha species), as coevolution has apparently driven the escalation of armaments in both predator and prey. Toxin resistance in the garter snake is largely due to key amino acid replacements in the NaV1.4 sodium channel protein. This project will use next-generation DNA sequencing to test whether snake gene flow promotes adaptation to toxic newts through the spread of TTX-resistance mutations in the NaV1.4 sodium channel. The researchers will generate two separate genetic datasets from garter snake populations across western North America: (1) genetic variation at the NaV1.4 locus, and (2) background genetic variation, unlinked to NaV1.4, in neutral Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) from double digest Restriction Associated DNA sequencing (ddRADseq). Population structure and gene flow will then be estimated separately for each dataset. Discordant patterns of gene flow between the two datasets will indicate where selection has altered the spread of NaV1.4 haplotypes in relation to neutral expectations of the SNPs. For example, in populations where gene flow and selection favor the spread of TTX-resistance mutations, gene flow at the NaV1.4 locus should exceed that of background variation in the neutral SNPs."

The proposed project focuses on sound (auditory) signals used in courtship in a species of fruit fly. The multiple auditory signals produced by this species are complex but their relationships to each other and genetic control of their production have not been determined. The proposed research incorporates methods from animal behavior, evolution, and genetics to better understand how conveying and receiving messages occurs in animals.  This can provide insights into what messages are passed from males to females and how these messages are genetically controlled. Given the abundance of genetic knowledge in fruit flies, and how many genes are shared between flies and humans, broader connections can be made from this species to other study systems. In addition, part of the project will extend public understanding of the genetics and information content of signals through mentorship of two undergraduate students, outreach at a local high school, attendance at national scientific conferences, and development of teaching materials for high school classrooms. <br/><br/>Signals transmitted between individuals are often complex and contain multiple components. These components may convey the same information, in which case they are expected to evolve in concert, or they may have separate messages, which implies independent evolution. Understanding how signal components co-vary and are genetically controlled may provide insight into the messages conveyed. To address this problem, the acoustic signals of Drosophila sturtevanti will be examined using a novel approach. This species has complex mating signals, generated by male wing vibration, that stimulate females to mate. Two signal components, pulse song and beep song, will be examined for phenotypic covariance. The absence of phenotypic co-variation between the song components will support the hypothesis that the respective components contain multiple messages. In contrast, significant positive co-variation will support the hypothesis that the respective components contain the same message. Alternatively, significant negative co-variation will support the hypothesis that respective components constrain each other. In addition to phenotypic covariance, the genetic architecture of the two signal components will be assessed through quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping using a next generation sequencing approach. The amount of co-localization of the QTLs for the signal components will determine the commonality of genetic control. Significant co-localization will imply shared genetic control and the direction of association (positive or negative) will indicate how selection pressures act on the genetically linked systems. Understanding the genetic control of associated signals is essential for elucidating mechanisms by which adaptive behavioral traits evolve and for modeling the evolution of multi-component signals."

Yet, despite these efforts, the management of traditional cultural properties - places of special significance to indigenous groups - on public lands remains a contentious issue. Contemporary collaborations between anthropologists and Native American communities have demonstrated that the importance of particular locations extends far beyond their economic utility and that, over time, a given place may be important to multiple groups and for many different reasons. Drawing on these insights, this doctoral dissertation research project will explore the implications that such an understanding of place has for the dynamics of landscape use in the past through a case study of 14 Adena (c. 500 BC - AD 250) sites located in northeastern Kentucky. The results of this research will contribute to understanding of a poorly understood period in American prehistory as well as enhance the infrastructure for research and education by updating existing museum collections. Results will also have implications for the repatriation process required by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act. Consequently, this project demonstrates the continuing relevance that archaeological research has for the development of federal policy concerning cultural resources management.<br/><br/>To explore the dynamics of landscape use in the past, this project focuses on the relationship between the construction of monuments and territorial behavior on the part of their builders - a long-standing paradigm within archaeological research. Rather than inferring territoriality from the spatial distribution of sites, this research takes a novel approach to investigating territorial behavior by evaluating change over time in both (1) how specific monuments were engaged with and (2) who was engaging with them. The former is assessed by investigating the spatial distribution of shared practices as indicated by similarities in mortuary behavior between discrete burial contexts. The latter is assessed by quantifying the relative amounts of biological variability present at multiple spatial scales. This is accomplished by using phenotypic variance as a proxy measure for biological variability and by collecting and analyzing data pertaining to a variety of cranial and dental metric and morphological traits. If monuments served a territorial function, they can be expected to have been embedded within relatively stable social configurations. In other words, they would have been used by the same social group or groups over time, resulting in spatial clustering of both shared practices and biological variability. Alternatively, as work with contemporary indigenous peoples suggests, monuments may have been engaged with by multiple social groups and in multiple ways. In this case, monuments are unlikely to have served a territorial function and, instead, can be expected to have been embedded within a sequence of changing social configurations. This situation would result in the loss of the spatial clustering of shared practices and biological variability that is expected within a territorial scenario. The results of this research will be compared to the expectations given above to provide a nuanced evaluation of past landscape use."

The discovery, classification, and characterization of extra-solar planets has stirred the imagination of lay people and professional astronomers alike. The discovery and characterization of an earth like planet, with atmospheric chemical signatures of life processes, would  have a profound impact on humanity.<br/><br/>Adaptive Optics (AO) systems have made significant improvements in both the imaging spatial resolution and contrast available to ground-based telescopes. Although an AO system attempts to fully correct for atmospheric-induced wavefront distortions, a real-world AO system does an imperfect job, resulting in the ""AO residual"", a set of speckles in the image plane that appear and disappear at millisecond time-scales. It has been shown that these speckles are a major limitation to high-contrast imaging, such as that involved in directly imaging exoplanets. In the proposed formulation, the science camera operates synchronously with the wavefront sensor (WFS), so that the science camera records a speckle pattern that corresponds to the wavefront measured by the WFS. The resulting millisecond exposures provide an information-rich dataset containing a random AO residual, measured by the WFS, that effectively interrogates the optical system and provides new information about the ""non-common path aberrations"", which, when corrected, can significantly improve ultra-high contract astronomical imaging."

To describe the quantum mechanical behavior of molecules, it is necessary to solve the electronic Schrodinger equation. Unfortunately, this equation is very difficult to solve, even with modern computers. The main problem is that computational effort for the most accurate methods grows with the sixth power of molecular size.  Martinez and coworkers design methods that reduce that scaling considerably. Such methods are needed to reach the goal of designing molecules with tailored properties, such as drugs that bind effectively to proteins and molecules with favorable fluorescent properties for use in biological imaging.  If this work is successful, the size of molecules whose properties can be accurately predicted will be greatly enlarged compared to present approaches.  <br/>  <br/>This project focuses on the development of the tensor hypercontraction method for electronic structure and ab initio molecular dynamics. Tensor hypercontraction casts the electron repulsion integrals and wave function amplitudes in a factorizable form, leading to scaling reductions by as much as two powers of the molecular size for wave function-based electronic structure methods like perturbation theory and coupled cluster.  The Martinez group is developing new grids for least-squares variants of hypercontraction and extending the hypercontraction methodology to include analytic gradients of the energy that are needed in first principle molecular dynamics.  They are exploring the application of hypercontraction to self-consistent field methods like Hartree-Fock and density functional theory. Hypercontraction emphasizes rank sparsity in the associated quantities. This is a powerful approach, but it is also useful to simultaneously exploit spatial locality (element sparsity).   New approaches which can exploit both rank and element sparsity simultaneously, i.e. a local form of tensor hypercontraction, are being considered.  These new and improved hypercontraction methods are used to predict fluorescence energies and lifetimes for fluorescent proteins that may be used in bioimaging applications."

Hence they are critical components in enabling NSF's science mission. Essentially, science gateways are a community-specific set of tools, applications, and data collections that are integrated together via a web portal or a desktop application, providing access to resources and services for distributed data, distributed computing and instruments, so that the complexity of the underlying infrastructure can be completely hidden from the users. Since the challenges for science gateways are many-fold and interdisciplinary, and there is considerable international activity around gateways, it is crucial to bring together users, science gateway developers and science gateway providers from across the world to share learnings and best practices. IWSG 2016 is the 8th workshop of the successful annual workshop series IWSG (International Workshop on Science Gateways), an interdisciplinary workshop series located in Europe that brings together these three groups and addresses various scientific domains, e.g. life sciences, biomedical research, chemistry, physics. It forms an international platform for discussing problems and solutions in the area, to identify new issues, to shape future directions for research, foster the exchange of ideas, standards and common requirements and push towards the wider adoption of science gateways in e-Science. Visionary keynote speakers have been chosen for IWSG 2016 with the intention of exposing workshop participants to science gateway achievements to present their fresh views and visions on the evolution and future of science gateways. Besides the keynotes, IWSG 2016 features talks, lightning talks, and demonstration sessions selected from submissions in a peer-review process. Submission of a full paper may result in a talk, submission of an abstract may result in a lightning talk or a demonstration. A key element of this workshop is that the resulting abstracts and talks will be made publicly available on the website, open-access proceedings will be published in an indexed online journal. Open-access indexed articles will attract more participants and will reach a wider community. Additionally, IWSG 2016 partners with the US and Australasian workshop series on science gateways. Authors of selected papers will be invited to submit a significantly extended paper to a special issue jointly organized by the three workshops. The talks, discussions and publications will provide a thorough view on science gateways and corresponding technologies while setting the stage for more intercontinental collaborations. <br/><br/>New technologies, simulations and experimental methods such as next-gen sequencing or the SKA (Square Kilometre Array) telescopes have enabled researchers to create huge amounts of data in extremely short times. The demand for compute power and storage is met with a rise in provision of distributed computing infrastructures (DCIs), such as grid and cloud infrastructures. Despite the increasing availability of resources, neither the broad uptake of these facilities and infrastructures nor the seamless integration of instruments creating data are following the same pace. The main reasons for this lie in the complexity of the human interface to these infrastructures and instruments. Science gateways tackle this problem and offer easy and intuitive access to computing infrastructures and instruments irrespective of their location. Since the challenges for science gateways are many-fold and interdisciplinary, and there is considerable international activity around gateways, it is crucial to bring together users, science gateway developers and science gateway providers from across the world to share learning and best practices.  The IWSG workshop series taking place each year at a different European city has attracted between 30 and 65 participants in the last years. The workshop and the workshop series in general make a significant contribution to the research in the area of science gateways. The output and discussions at IWSG 2016 will reflect the current international standard in the area of science gateways, enable research groups attain novel capabilities in the area of scientific data management, collaboration and computing and enabled research groups attain standard of international excellence by using a peer-review system to select the best papers and abstracts only. The workshop aids in the creation of resources in the form of novel approaches for the delivery and use of science gateways that will facilitate a wider uptake of distributed and parallel methods. The partnership with the US and Australian workshop series and the joint special issue enlarges the outreach further to intercontinental level."

While some marsh losses result from coastal development, others losses have yet to be fully explained. Marshes can build soil vertically and gain elevation to keep pace with slowly rising seas, but the marsh plants that sustain these ecosystems get stressed when sea level rises too quickly. The amount of sea level a marsh can tolerate depends on other factors that are also changing. For instance, the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere is rising. Likewise, pollution from nutrients like nitrogen has increased sharply from preindustrial times. Both increased carbon dioxide and nitrogen tend to make marsh plants grow more, which could help marshes keep up with sea level rise. But they also change the types of plants that grow and it is unknown what effects that will have on marshes. This project asks: how will rising carbon dioxide and nitrogen affect plants and the ability of coastal marshes to keep up with sea level rise? Since about half of the U.S. population lives within 50 miles of a coastline, there is considerable pressure on coastal wetlands and the services they provide. The annual loss of low-lying coastal wetlands lost to open water each year threatens fisheries, wildlife habitat, water quality, and infrastructure. The project will also continue public education and science education programs at many levels, and the research results will be made freely available on a public Smithsonian Institution website. <br/><br/>To address the central question of this project, the study builds on a thirty-year history of ecological observations at a Chesapeake Bay marsh in Maryland. Measurements of primary production and soil chemistry will be combined with parallel experiments that simulate the future environment by adding carbon dioxide and nitrogen to marsh plots, and comparisons will be made of native to invading plants. The long-term records of this site enable the scientists to document changes in the species composition of plants growing on the marsh over time. At this point, the surface elevation of the soil in the marsh is falling behind local sea level rise, suggesting that this marsh may be in the process of collapsing. The investigators will continue their local measurements, but the results should be generally applicable to coastal wetlands everywhere."

The research has been formulated to answer three main questions: How do diffusivities (D's) of trace elements in enamel depend on 1) charge vs. ionic radius and partitioning? 2) enamel orientation and enamel type?  3) fossilization state? To address these questions, uptake experiments will be conducted over a range of temperatures (4°, 20° and 37 °C) for a range of ions and ionic radii. D's will be measured in different directions for the two main enamel types in mammals - radial and decussate. Measurements in fossil enamel will be compared with similar measurements we make in modern enamel. The data will be inverted using standard diffusion equations, and natural datasets will be evaluated for their consistency (or not) with diffusion-limited uptake. The results will broadly constrain REE, uranium and alkaline element partition coefficients, which will improve models of diffusion rate and uptake of these geochemically- and toxicologically important elements. All data will be published rapidly in accessible international journals and/or archived in on-line geochemical databases.

All of the students are encouraged to consider a career in science. Society benefits from citizens who are more aware of the process of science and the benefits of scientific research. <br/><br/>The summer research experience at KSU offers the undergraduate research participants (URPs) the opportunity to participate in research that encompasses a broad range of study in chemistry including biochemistry, analytical chemistry, chemical education, inorganic chemistry, materials chemistry, organic chemistry, organometallic chemistry, and physical chemistry. The URPs participate in weekly group meetings with their research mentor and his/her other research students, in workshops on topics ranging from laboratory safety to career opportunities.  They also participate in an end-of-the-summer research symposium and in social activities designed to help them assimilate into their research groups.  They form an initial network of colleagues and scientific associates that can help them in their future careers."

Consequently, we need new ways to seamlessly and effectively communicate and interact with such ubiquitous and always-available computing devices. A natural choice for such communication and interaction is human gestures because gestures are an integral part of the way humans communicate and interact with each other in their daily lives. This project aims at using ambient light and cheap commercial off-the-shelf light sensors to develop a gesture recognition system. The intuition behind this approach is that as a user performs a gesture in a room that is lit with light, the amount of light that he/she reflects and blocks changes, resulting in changes in the intensity of light in all parts of the room. The patterns of change in the intensity of light are different for different gestures, which can be learnt and used to recognize the gestures.<br/><br/>In developing the ambient light based gesture recognition system, this project has two primary objectives: (1) environment independence, i.e., making the system agnostic to the characteristics of the environment, such as different lighting conditions, and (2) user independence, i.e., making the system agnostic to the number of users in a room and their routine activities. Several challenges arise in developing the ambient light based gesture recognition system, such as automatically detecting the start and end of a gesture, removing noise from the time-series of sensor values, handling the varying time durations of the different occurrences of the same gesture, simultaneously recognizing the gestures of multiple people, and recognizing the gestures of non-stationary users. This project will not only address these and other similar challenges, but will also advance the knowledge and understanding of the use of ambient light for novel systems by yielding a theoretical foundation for modeling human gestures and routine activities using changes in the intensity of light.<br/><br/>The successful completion of this project will greatly benefit our society. First, this project will make the data set collected during this project publicly available for research. Second, the proposed ambient light based gesture recognition system will introduce a new and convenient way for users to interact with the computing embedded in their environments. Third, the proposed project will bridge several different communities such as systems, signal processing, machine learning, mobile computing, and human computer interaction; and foster interaction and communication among them. Fourth, the educational side of the project will integrate the research findings into the undergraduate and graduate curricula at North Carolina State University."

A paradigm shift in engineering design and product realization is thus occurring, and many industries, such as biomedical and aerospace, are poised to benefit.  Some examples include (1) on-site, rapid fabrication of metallic bone implants with patient and injury-specific designs, and (2) fabrication of replacement parts in remote locations (e.g. outer space).  Nonetheless, metallic parts made by current additive manufacturing methods tend to have porosity and anisotropy, features typically detrimental to part strength and fatigue resistance. Such parts cannot be used with confidence in load-bearing applications.   This award supports scientific investigation that can potentially enable production of fatigue resistant metallic parts by additive manufacturing.  <br/><br/>The objectives of this research are (1) to establish relationships between microstructure properties (grain orientation, and morphology), porosity distribution (size, shape, and location), and  process parameters (laser power, scanning speed, hatch spacing, and layer orientation); and (2) to understand effects of microstructure properties (grain orientation) and porosity of additively-manufactured materials on their multi-axial fatigue resistance.  To achieve the first objective, continuum-scale thermophysical models will be developed and used to relate microstructure properties and porosity distribution to process parameters.  These models will be experimentally validated.  Ti-6Al-4V specimens will be fabricated using laser-based additive manufacturing under various process parameter combinations.  The layer orientation will be altered between 0º-90º, while scanning speed, hatch spacing, and laser power will be varied within ranges prescribed from existing knowledge (e.g. published experimental data). Microstructure properties and porosity distribution of fabricated specimens will be measured using X-ray tomography (size, shape, and location of porosity), as well as optical and scanning electron microscopy (grain orientation, and morphology).  To achieve the second objective, multi-axial microstructure-sensitive fatigue models based on critical plane approaches will be developed and validated by experiments.  Multi-axial fatigue experiments will be conducted on fabricated specimens, using in-phase and out-of-phase discriminating load paths to exercise different critical loading planes.  Fractography on the fracture surface of specimens will be performed to determine location, size, and shape of the pore(s) responsible for initiating cracks. Crack replication techniques will be employed to find the orientation of fatigue micro-cracks with respect to critical loading plane and to determine effects of anisotropic microstructure on fatigue behavior. Through the collaboration with the Korea Institute of Industrial Technology, the generated models will be tested on other additive manufacturing methods and materials."

This was also the last time in which atmospheric CO2 rose by a substantial amount prior to the industrial period.  The last glacial termination therefore represents a spectacular natural experiment played out by the Earth system that can be studied in order to decipher the underlying dynamics of the climate system and its sensitivity to forcing factors, such as atmospheric CO2.  This project aims to determine when, and how rapidly, glaciers receded and the climate warmed at the end of the last ice age in the heart of Asia - Earth's largest and most populous continent. This research will help identify factors that produced this last great global warming, and to clarify the role of atmospheric CO2 in ice-age climate cycles. This work will provide immersive, field-based, and cooperative educational experiences for the next generation of scientists.  The project will bring together a research team that includes underrepresented high-school students and STEM teachers from the South Side of Chicago, graduate and undergraduate students from the U.S.A., Mongolia, and China, and graduate students of science journalism. The overarching goal is to establish and nurture international and cross-cultural educational and scientific partnerships that are built to last well beyond the duration of this project.<br/><br/>Identifying the causes of the last glacial termination is a major objective of the earth and climate sciences, and requires detailed chronologies of sensitive paleoclimate proxies that monitored the last glacial-to-interglacial transition across the planet. The purpose of this CAREER research is to develop such chronologies from the center of Asia for the reduction of mountain glacier extent from the peak of the last ice age to today's conditions. Glacier chronologies will be based on precise and accurate 10Be surface-exposure dating of glacial landforms in the mid-latitude Altai range of Mongolia and in the monsoonal eastern Himalaya of China. Glaciological modeling will convert these glacier reconstructions into records of glacier-inferred atmospheric temperature, which will in turn be compared with signatures of incoming solar radiation, greenhouse gases, as well as other proposed drivers, to discriminate among possible causes of the last termination. This project will be carried out following an integrated research and education plan that implements a cooperative, field-based learning strategy in which students at different levels learn by teaching each other.  The collaborative, cross-cultural, multi-national, and multi-generational team will share knowledge and experiences in the field and throughout the scientific process.  This team will consist of (1) graduate and undergraduate students from the University of Maine, (2) students and researchers from Mongolian and Chinese institutions, (3) students and science teachers from the Gary Comer College Preparatory school ? a public charter school devoted to improving the lives of underserved minority students from the South Side of Chicago, and (4) embedded science journalism graduate students from the Medill School of Journalism who will produce stories for publication and broadcast, thus documenting scientific outcomes for the public."

This project aims to address basic physical storage issues and to make all data publicly available via an on-line database so as to maximize its potential as a source of information on social behavior in insects. A two-part exhibit will engage the campus community. One part will highlight the Rettenmeyers' collecting activities. Across campus, the second part will include a large ant model complete with an array of mites attached all to scale. <br/><br/>This project is motivated by the recent donation of the Rettenmeyer Army Ant Guest Collection (AAGC) to the UConn Department of Ecology & Evolutionary Biology Biodiversity Research Collection Facility. The AAGC comprises more than 2 million specimens of New World army ants and their associated arthropods. It includes ca. 1,000 types representing 200 species, ca. 16,000 pinned specimens, ca. 5,000 microscope slides, more than 15,000 vials and jars, complemented by detailed field data and 5,000 Kodachrome transparencies. The collection is in dire need of stabilization - fluid levels are low, stoppers are deteriorating, specimens are overcrowded and disorganized. The project's two primary goals are specimen curation (e.g., replacing fluid, re-vialing, labeling, attaching barcodes, and reorganization) and establishing an on-line presence by modifying an existing MySQL database to accommodate the AAGC in four related Tables. Type specimens and colony exemplars will be image and linked to database records. Data will be shared with iDigBio (www.idigbio.org) and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility.  High school students will work with graduate students to hone their writing and observation skills as they interpret slide labels to populate the database. Project results can be accessed online (biodiversity.uconn.edu/ant-guests/)."

The PPEPPD conference is the premier worldwide conference in the area of molecular thermodynamics as related to chemical process and product design.  By subsidizing airfare for attendance of both senior and junior academic researchers at the conference, the award will foster exchange of scientific ideas and the latest advances in this important area of chemical research focusing on thermophysical properties and phase equilibrium data needed to lower costs and improve efficiencies across a broad spectrum of chemical products and processes. <br/><br/>PPEPPD 2016 will bring together international researchers in the application of molecular thermodynamics to industrially relevant product and process design. The conference will provide a forum for interactions between both junior and senior researchers at the cutting edge of techniques for thermophysical properties and phase equilibrium measurement and estimation, and identify the challenges in the growing areas of alternative energy resources and storage, gas and oil upstream and downstream processing, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, marine and saline systems and processes, nanotechnology, and sustainability. One of the primary goals of PPEPPD is to provide interaction between academic, government, and industrial researchers on how molecular thermodynamics (experimental and computation) can benefit real-world industrial product and process design. The meetings are the most important gatherings for molecular thermodynamicists from all over the world - typically attracting 200-300 participants from North America, South America, Europe, Asia, the Middle East, and Africa. The topics selected by the International Organizing Committee of the 14th PPEPPD include both fundamental aspects of molecular thermodynamics (thermodynamics and transport properties, surfaces, interfaces and confinement effects, quantum calculations and force fields, and molecular and multiscale simulations),and applied aspects (product and process engineering, gas and oil downstream and upstream processes, alternative energy resources and storage, environmental processes, sustainability and risk management, carbon capture and storage, pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, food processing, agrochemicals and biomass, marine and saline systems, materials, and nanotechnology). <br/><br/>The purpose of PPEPPD is the sharing of state-of-the-art techniques to further product and process design that will fuel world-wide economic growth in the chemical and related industries, and allow the modeling of new separation processes for meeting lower greenhouse gas emission goals. U.S. participation is essential for making contributions to the general knowledge base, for building awareness of global activities, and for fostering international collaboration. The requested funding would provide air fare support for a few senior invited U.S. lecturers and members of the international organizing committee, but will mainly provide support for approximately 16 young researchers who would not be able to attend without such support. From an educational standpoint, this represents a unique opportunity for young attendees to network with peers from around the world and experience the latest worldwide perspective on research trends in the areas of thermodynamics, transport properties, phase equilibria, etc. as related to a broad range of chemical processes and products."

It is believed to play a key role in the evolutionary process by creating innovation in organism traits. Therefore, understanding how evolution acts on duplicate genes will provide key insights into how complex traits and novel forms have arisen. The main goal of this project is to determine the evolutionary forces responsible for the retention of duplicate genes in an organism's genome. The researchers will test the specific hypothesis that the evolution of functional duplicate genes (those that have a new function) is primarily a consequence of natural selection. Scientists have long thought this to be the case, but have never been able to experimentally test this hypothesis. This project uses an innovative method that allows this hypothesis to be tested for the first time. Results will help to understand how organism traits evolve within and among species. The award will have multiple broader impacts on the scientific community by supporting the training of undergraduate and graduate students, development of open source computer software, and dissemination of research findings in open access publications. Additionally, the researchers will design and teach courses on bioinformatics and genomics to local K-12 students at the Science-U camp hosted by Pennsylvania State University each summer. Curricula developed for these courses will also be made freely available on a website for teachers.<br/><br/>The proposed research will examine the impact of natural selection on duplicate gene functions via both sequence- and expression-level approaches. The researchers recently developed a phylogenetic approach for identifying duplicate genes with novel functions by quantifying differences between their gene expression profiles in closely related species. Application of this method to spatial gene expression profiles in Drosophila revealed that most young duplicates possess new functions, and that acquisition of new functions occurs rapidly. Conversely, in mammals, most young duplicates retain their ancestral functions, and functional divergence occurs more gradually. The contrast in functional divergence rates between duplicate genes in these lineages is reminiscent of the faster sequence-level evolution observed in Drosophila relative to mammals. Researchers will test the hypothesis that natural selection also plays an important role in acquisition of new functions by duplicate genes. Researchers will apply a combination of traditional sequence-based, as well as innovative, expression-based tests for natural selection on duplicate genes. The objectives of these analyses will be to elucidate the role of natural selection in functional divergence of duplicate genes, and to examine differences in selective forces acting on duplicates in populations of different sizes, over evolutionary time, and with varying levels of functional divergence."

Although methods for combining these data have made significant advances, these approaches still do not consider the completeness and sampling of the fossil record or the geographical distributions of living and fossil species. For this project, the investigators will integrate statistical models for describing how fossils are sampled over time and where species are found. These models for estimating species relationships will be developed in widely used software packages, making them broadly accessible to other researchers. These new methods will be tested using both simulated and real datasets. Specifically, two vertebrate groups with rich fossil records will be studied: penguins and crocodyliforms (crocodiles, alligators, gharials, and extinct relatives). This work will help to uncover how rates of speciation and extinction have changed over time for these species. The methods developed as part of this project will be taught in workshops for evolutionary biologists. Additionally, results from analyses of data from living and fossil penguins will be contributed to a public museum exhibit at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, CT. <br/><br/>In recent years, advances in phylogenetic inference methods have provided ways to integrate fossil and extant taxa. These approaches allow simultaneous estimation of the divergence times and phylogenetic relationships of extant and fossil species, thus making full use of morphological and temporal data, rather than just molecular sequence data from living species. Approaches combining fossil and extant taxa have opened the door for fully integrative phylogenetic methods that use more sources of biological data, including stratigraphy, sampling, and biogeography. Thus, there is a need for comprehensive statistical models and methods that accommodate this information. The investigators will develop new, Bayesian statistical models, extensions of stochastic birth-death processes, that will integrate information about the fossil record and biogeography for use in phylogenetic methods that consider both extant and fossil taxa. The new models will be implemented in the program RevBayes. The performance and adequacy of new and previously described models will be evaluated using simulated and empirical datasets. New methods will be used to investigate macroevolutionary patterns in two exemplar clades: Sphenisciformes (penguins) and Crocodyliformes, addressing key hypotheses about phylogenetic relationships, lineage diversification, and biogeography."

This project will perform the first distribution-wide, phylogeographic study of this lizard species, providing opportunities to find cryptic diversity in the group (i.e., new species) as well as a unique opportunity to evaluate competing hypotheses of diversification in both rainforests and dry habitats.  Data collected for the Amazon racerunner will also be used to address future risk to species due to climate change.  The work is a collaboration with South American colleagues to study key physiological traits (e.g., temperature preference and performance) to reconstruct species distribution models and assess extinction risk.  Because modeling historical distributions is based on paleoclimate data, these same models can be used to predict the effect that increasing temperatures will have on future distributions of organisms.  Results from this research will be developed into a teaching module and used to show non-Biology major students real-world observations used in hypothesis testing, here focused on speciation and biogeography.  Real examples from the researchers' extensive field and lab work will personalize the data for students and enhance their appreciation of the multi-faceted nature of science, and the nature of its conclusions.<br/><br/>Preliminary results suggests that Ameiva ameiva represents a complex of species, which will be tested by sampling as much of the distribution as possible, and generating a combination of Sanger, NextGen, and several classes of morphological data to define species boundaries.

In addition to morphological data collection, 100s-1000s of SNPs (ddRADseq) for 200 individuals of A. ameiva will be incorporated into newly developed species delimitation (SDL) methods.  A recently developed SDL Bayesian approach that integrates morphological with molecular data (iBPP) was shown to perform well under a variety of scenarios, and this will be the preferred (but not exclusive) method used in this study.

At present, advanced permanent magnets require rare-earth metals that are in limited supply in the current situation of the global supply chain. Equiatomic FeNi with the chemically ordered tetragonal structure, known as tetrataenite, is found naturally only in selected meteorites subjected to extraordinarily long cooling periods and has been confirmed to exhibit excellent permanent magnetic properties.

For plants, interactions with insects are thought to be important drivers of biodiversity, most obviously through herbivory and pollination. Carnivorous plants are unique in that, while they largely rely on insects as pollinators, they also prey upon them as a vital nutrient resource. This research studies how plant-insect interactions have contributed to carnivorous plant evolution using the North American Pitcher Plant genus, Sarracenia, as a model. Specifically, it studies how these interactions have contributed to the chemical signaling that carnivorous plants use to attract and capture insects as prey, while simultaneously avoiding capturing their insect pollinators. One undergraduate will be mentored in field and laboratory techniques. Results from this research will be incorporated into K-12 education programs and undergraduate classes, and will be broadly disseminated to the public. <br/><br/>Previous research suggests that there are 'carnivorous syndromes', or tightly correlated trapping traits (e.g., trichome density, height) that are associated with prey specialization or prey partitioning. This research will examine whether 'attractive' trap traits, specifically volatile emissions, are additionally correlated with prey partitioning across Sarracenia species. By using a recent phylogeny generated by the researchers as a framework and an outdoor common garden maintained by the Atlanta Botanical Garden, this project examines whether mechanisms to alleviate capturing pollinators have further resulted in prey specialization. Volatiles emissions will be collected from 14 putative Sarracenia taxa over the 30-day lifespan of the traps. Statistical correlations among volatile profiles and previously measured trap traits will be examined using a phylogenetic generalized least square analysis. The resulting volatile emissions will be compared to prey captured also using a phylogenetic generalized least square analysis. Flower volatiles will be examined and compared to pitcher volatiles to test for variation in chemical cues. Temporal and spatial separation between flowers and traps will additionally be measured and analyzed statistically to test the overarching hypotheses."

Various radiation treatment modalities, such as photons, protons, and neutrons, are currently used in an effort to eradicate cancer cells while preserving the functionality of healthy tissue. Each modality has its own physical and radiobiological strengths as well as weaknesses. Using more than one modality in treating cancer is motivated by the idea of exploiting the advantages of different radiation types to overcome the weaknesses that any single modality suffers, and eventually improving the efficacy of cancer therapy. Current efforts on finding an optimal, multi-modality treatment paradigm for a particular cancer type are mostly empirical, and heuristic searches result in a long and costly period of trial-and-error. This award supports research to develop an optimization tool that systematically searches for optimal, multi-modality radiotherapy schemes, which can then be tailored to particular cancer types as needed. The optimal treatment protocols will provide guidance in designing trials of new effective and efficient radiation treatments. If successful, this will lead to longer survival and increase quality of life for cancer patients. The multi-disciplinary project team will include students and trainees in different areas including industrial engineering, applied mathematics, and medical physics, and positively impact education in science and engineering.<br/><br/>This research utilizes the stochastic control formalism, where the system consists of the tumor and normal tissue subject to the modality-specific uncertainty and tumor-specific radiobiological parameters. The time-dependent beam intensities of multiple radiation types are used as controls, and they determine the spatiotemporal dose distribution during a treatment course. Optimal treatment consists of the maximum biologically-effective-dose or equivalent uniform dose feasible for a given patient's physical and radiobiological condition, which is positively correlated with clinical outcomes. The research team will construct the general optimization framework, apply to specific cancer types using phantom studies, perform numerical simulations to quantify the potential benefits of an optimal solution over the conventional treatment schemes that are currently used in practice, and come up with treatment paradigms that could be tested in future clinical trials."

Voluminous igneous eruptions driven by deep mantle sources are thought to have caused global environmental changes. Located approximately 3000 km below the surface of the planet, the core-mantle boundary region represents one of the most dramatic compositional and thermal boundary layers within our planet. Gradients across this boundary exert a primary influence on the cooling of the planet, on the dynamics of the core (and hence Earth's magnetic field), and on the dynamics of the mantle (perhaps expressed as large-scale volcanism at the Earth's surface). Major progress towards understanding the dynamics of the deep Earth system within various geoscience disciplines has been made possible through advances in experimental and computational facilities and techniques, instrumental resolution, and deployment of the USArray. Capitalizing on these major advancements and the team's individual expertise within seismology, geodynamics, and experimental mineral physics, the team will study the interaction of subducted slabs with multi-scale lower mantle structures in the framework of mantle flow. They will mentor next generation scientists working in their multi-disciplinary environment, which should improve understanding of how the planet works as a global system.<br/><br/>    Seismologists have revealed that the mantle side of the CMB is extraordinarily heterogeneous, with km-scale fine structure that could harbor distinct chemical reservoirs. Thermal and chemical heterogeneity, solid-solid phase transitions, elastic anisotropy, variable viscosity, and melting are probably all required to explain this observed complexity. With individual expertise in seismology (Helmberger and Zhan), geodynamics (Gurnis), and experimental mineral physics (Jackson), they will connect the atomic scale (thermoelastic properties of deep Earth phases) to the tectonic scale (seismically observed structures and their dynamics) and link all processes to the temporal dimension (reconstruction of tectonic plate history). They will conduct a systematic study of the Pacific large low seismic velocity province (LLSVP) using whole seismograms compared against synthetics generated from existing enhanced tomographic models and compressible thermo-chemical convection with reasonable plate tectonic reconstructions. A detailed comparison of the Pacific and African LLSVPs will be done to test the impact of tectonic histories, presence of seismic anisotropy, and possible compositional and/or thermal differences. The experiments assess the sources of (1) seismic anisotropy through inelastic x-ray scattering and diffraction experiments on single crystals of (Mg0.22Fe0.78)O magnesiowüstite (2) seismic gradients and discontinuities through x-ray diffraction experiments on mid-oceanic ridge basalt phase assemblages. Their study will culminate with generating an updated global map of the CMB region. The fundamental questions they will address include: Can the presence of subducted slabs deform LLSVPs into seismically resolvable 3D shapes? Is iron-rich (Mg,Fe)O a source of observable seismic anisotropy, developed by flow of the mantle near subducting slabs? How do these slabs interact and affect D? topography and chemically-distinct structures near the edges of LLSVPs?"

The doctoral student will explore how the law could potentially recognize sea ice as a flexible entity that is incorporated into multiple legal spaces and systems.  The project will broaden theoretical understandings of linkages among human systems, climate and environmental change, and spatial dimensions of the ocean and law in the greater Arctic region.  The project will advance conceptualizations of sea ice in a way that recognizes that sea ice is not a stationary object, because it moves through time and space in response to the physical forces of wind, ocean currents, and heating.  Furthermore, sea ice is neither terrestrial nor marine, just as it is neither purely solid nor liquid.  Project findings will expand knowledge about the relationships between this dynamic physical element and the political powers that govern a complex ocean environment.  The project will provide new insights regarding how the law can recognize sea ice as a flexible entity that is attached to and integrated into multiple legal spaces and systems.  These insights will be of value to those charged with overseeing activities in regions where sea ice occurs.  Among those organizations is the multinational Arctic Council, which the United States chairs from 2015 to 2017.  Project findings will help address two of the focus areas of the U.S. chairmanship (the impacts of changing climate and environmental conditions and Arctic Ocean safety, security, and stewardship) by expanding knowledge about the role that changing spatial sea ice patterns have in the many political debates of this region.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>Changes to the spatial extent of sea ice in the Arctic Ocean simultaneously permit and endanger maritime operations, and those changes impact current debates over maritime boundaries, presenting an interesting challenge for international law.  In conducting this project, the doctoral student will combine perspectives from the fields of legal geography and ocean-space studies to assess how dynamic and changing sea ice shapes the marine social-environment, particularly in terms of legal and political contestations in ocean-spaces of the greater Arctic region.  The student will use three data-collection strategies:  legal archival analysis to gain a base understanding of all relevant laws and agreements; document analysis of reports and other official documents to understand and contextualize the broader environmental, social, political and economic issues in each of these regions; and semi-structured interviews with policy experts, operational experts that work in sea-ice areas, and sea-ice researchers.  The interviews will focus on participants' experiences with boundary issues in sea-ice waters, their perceptions of sovereignty, their experience with resource extractive operations in sea-ice waters, and their perceptions of change in an already dynamic Arctic marine environment."

We still do not understand the general principles that link specific neural response properties with the structure of behaviorally relevant signals. This project will address this question by comparing how the brain encodes communication signals several closely related species of electric fish that display key differences in their signals. The project will use neurophysiological experiments, behavioral assays, and signal analysis to ask how brain mechanisms are optimized to species-specific signal properties and how these neural mechanisms influence the ability of the animals to perceive signals. The project will test the hypothesis that the structure of communication signals and the patterns of neural responses are efficiently matched across species to enable to detect and/or the discriminate conspecific signals. The model system, the communication signals of weakly electric fishes, is an ideal platform to link evolutionary, neurophysiological, and computational approaches to understanding the neural basis of behavior.  Furthermore, electric fishes' use of a ""sixth sense"" to detect their world and communicate is a fascinating phenomenon that can engage public interest in animal diversity and neurobiology. The project will train high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. The researchers will also work with K-12 teachers to develop lesson plans that are linked to the project?s research and that are aligned with the learning goals of the AP Biology curriculum.<br/><br/>Communication signals often evolve with peripheral sensory filters to optimize species-specific signal capture. Much less is known, however, about how central sensory circuits evolve to efficiently extract and analyze complex features of conspecific signals. This project will comparatively study the communication signals and sensory systems of weakly electric fish to investigate relationships between signal structure, neural mechanisms of sensory processing, and perceptual tasks. The central hypothesis is that sensory coding and signal structure co-evolve in response to perceptual demands to permit efficient detection and discrimination of conspecific signals. The project will first analyze how cross-species variation in the structure of two communication signals that impinge on the same sensory channel influences the conspicuousness of signals. The project will then use in vivo electrophysiology to compare how the coding strategies of central sensory neurons are related to the structure of signals across species. Finally, behavioral tests will quantify how signal structure and sensory coding strategies influence the abilities of the fish to detect and discriminate signals. The project thus explicitly links signal diversity, sensory systems, and behavior. This project has strong potential to open a new direction in studying the mechanisms and evolution of communication systems by revealing how complex features of species-specific signals are co-adapted with neural coding strategies and the sensory tasks they accomplish. The CoPIs will take advantage of the interdisciplininary approaches of the project and the charismatic and engaging nature of the animal model to provide outreach and educational opportunities from the K-12 to advanced graduate levels."

This project will allow a group of U.S. scientists from the University of South Carolina and the University of Wisconsin to participate in two research cruises of the German Research Vessel Sonne.  The expedition of the Research Vessel Sonne will collect rock samples from the seafloor in the Alaska-Aleutian subduction system and adjacent Bering Sea region in June-July 2016. This area has many earthquakes and volcanic eruptions, but little is known about its early geologic history and evolution.  Samples collected during these scientific cruises will be used to understand the evolution of the Aleutian Island arc and adjacent Bering Sea region over the past 50 million years. Graduate and undergraduate students will participate on the cruises and gain important sea-going experience.  All post-cruise data will be made available to the public.<br/><br/>This project focuses on three scientific themes: (1) inception and early development of the Aleutian Island arc, (2) occurrence and composition of active volcanism in the western Aleutian arc, and (3) arc inputs - the age and composition of North Pacific Oceanic lithosphere. Dredging and subsequent geochemical and geochronologic studies will target submarine canyons and other exposed basement structures in the Aleutian forearc.  Samples from these features will provide constraints on the timing and kinematics of Aleutian arc formation.  Dredging will also target volcanic cones of the western Aleutian seafloor and fracture zones on the down-going north Pacific Plate.  Samples from these features will be used to characterize inputs from subducted oceanic crust in the Aleutian arc and their relationship to regional patterns in along-strike geochemistry.

The Gordon Research Seminar, to be held on this topic for the first time, is organized by graduate student co-chairs with presenters and discussion leaders also being graduate students, postdocs, and early career scientists. This topical area holds great relevance for the advancement of knowledge that can enhance or even revolutionize energy storage, conversion, and conservation technologies, elevating the importance of the scientific discussion and especially the education of a new generation of researchers in this area.<br/><br/>Colloidal nanocrystals are chemically synthesized in organic media and their surfaces are passivated with organic surfactants that solubilize the nanocrystals in solvent dispersion, and perform a range of functions, including electronic passivation of surface states, mediation of chemical interactions with other materials, and electronic exchange with the environment. Recently, it has become clear that controlling the chemistry of the surfaces of the nanocrystals is critical to observing the special properties promised by quantum confinement. The goals of this Gordon Research Conference are to explore the photophysical and materials properties of colloidal nanocrystals in terms of the chemical structure of both the core and the surface. The Conference program highlights: (i) synthetic methods to tune the composition, shape, and surface chemistry of nanocrystals, (ii) new analytical methods to quantitatively characterize the core and surface chemistry of the nanocrystals, (iii) photophysical studies of nanocrystals that relate activity in chemical and electronic systems, (iv) doping and plasmonic behavior in semiconductor nanocrystals, (v) the bio-compatibility and bio-applications of nanocrystals, and (vi) methods to form and properties of assemblies of nanocrystals. The program also features a session on emerging nanocrystal materials, specifically pnictides and halides. The value of this conference, with respect to pushing forward fundamental work in this field, lies in its compilation of advancements in these diverse topics into a single program addressed to a single interdisciplinary audience."

Being able to control this patterning in next-generation polymers is important for applications such as nanolithography, flexible electronics, and biomedicine. These polymers have much more complicated chemical structures and molecular-scale shapes than typical polymer molecules. This project is targeted at understanding how complexity in the molecule's chemical structure and shape affects its ability to form patterns involving the mutual packing of many molecules.  To do this, molecules will be designed and studied that are inspired by biological polymers (proteins) but allow for tuning of their shape, stiffness, and chemical structure.   Undergraduate and graduate student researchers will be trained at national research user-facilities, participate in local and national scientific meetings, and interact closely with research collaborators. Combining both research and learning to interact in the broader scientific community comprises an integral part of the educational experience for graduate students bound for either industrial careers or the academic world. Furthermore, the PI will partner with the UCSB Center for Science and Engineering Partnerships to incorporate a diverse cadre of incoming community-college transfer students into the research group to both ease transfer shock and provide research experience.   A robust program of ""Science Night"" outreach activities at Santa Barbara/Goleta elementary and middle schools will continue to generate excitement in STEM fields among a new generation of students.<br/><br/> <br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Equilibrium self-assembled mesostructures in block copolymers arise from the competition between enthalpic segregation of dissimilar blocks, liquid crystalline interactions, composition, and the mismatch in scaling dimensions between blocks. The ability to synthesize sequence-specific polypeptoids at gram scale presents a unique opportunity to directly test predictions of copolymer self-assembly that suggest both 'blockiness' and gradient strength in a copolymer sequence impacts the chain's ability to minimize free energy by sorting monomers to the preferred side of the interface.   Furthermore, the chain persistence length is tunable on a single chemical platform by controlling the sequence, side chain chirality, and bulkiness.  This platform provides the conformational (persistence length) control necessary to explore the continuum of semiflexible chain shapes between the rod and coil limits. In addition, the fundamental role of asymmetry in contributing long-range entropic effects to the free energy of mixing will be explored.  The goal of this project is to develop a deep understanding of how sequence and chain shape impact the free energy contributions to block copolymer self-assembly. It is expected that this fundamental understanding will guide the design of semiflexible and sequence-defined block copolymers and ultimately impact fields as diverse as organic optoelectronics and biomaterials."

Assured privacy protection offers unprecedented opportunities for industry innovation, science and engineering discovery, as well as new life enhancing experiences and opportunities. The ability to perform efficient and yet privacy preserving big data computations in the Cloud holds great potential for safe and effective data analytics, such as enabling health-care applications to provide personalized medical treatments using an individual's DNA sequence, or enabling advertisers to create targeted advertisements by mining a user's clickstream and social activities, without violation of data privacy. The PrivacyGuard project is developing algorithms, systems and tools that provide end-to-end privacy guarantees over the life cycle of a data analytic job.  The end-to-end privacy guarantee can be measured by how difficult one can learn about some of the original sensitive data from the sanitized data releases, the intermediate results of execution and the output of an analytic job. The ultimate goal of PrivacyGuard is to develop a methodical framework and a suite of techniques for ensuring distributed computations to meet the desired privacy requirements of input data, as well as protecting against disclosure of sensitive patterns during execution and in the final output of the computation.<br/><br/>The PrivacyGuard project advances the knowledge and understanding of privacy preserving distributed computation from three perspectives: (1) It designs formal mechanisms to formulate a data owner's end-to-end privacy requirement for each data release, for example, by associating each data release with a well-defined usage scope to confine the set of data analytics models and algorithms that can operate on the released data. (2) It develops a suite of execution privacy guards with dual objectives: to audit and enforce privacy compliances during distributed computation against data-flow based privacy violations and to guard the compliance of input privacy. (3) It devises a proactive approach to output privacy against information leakages associated with mining output, for example, by leveraging differential privacy model to maximize the upper bound for data privacy guarantee and minimize the lower bound for data utility losses.  The PrivacyGuard project is the first effort towards a practical and systematic implementation framework for ensuring the end-to-end privacy in distributed big data computations. Furthermore, by integrating the PrivacyGuard research with the curriculum development on big data systems and analytics courses at Georgia Institute of Technology, it contributes to the education and training of new generation of data scientists to be the privacy compliance advocates."

Although methods for combining these data have made significant advances, these approaches still do not consider the completeness and sampling of the fossil record or the geographical distributions of living and fossil species. For this project, the investigators will integrate statistical models for describing how fossils are sampled over time and where species are found. These models for estimating species relationships will be developed in widely used software packages, making them broadly accessible to other researchers. These new methods will be tested using both simulated and real datasets. Specifically, two vertebrate groups with rich fossil records will be studied: penguins and crocodyliforms (crocodiles, alligators, gharials, and extinct relatives). This work will help to uncover how rates of speciation and extinction have changed over time for these species. The methods developed as part of this project will be taught in workshops for evolutionary biologists. Additionally, results from analyses of data from living and fossil penguins will be contributed to a public museum exhibit at the Bruce Museum in Greenwich, CT. <br/><br/>In recent years, advances in phylogenetic inference methods have provided ways to integrate fossil and extant taxa. These approaches allow simultaneous estimation of the divergence times and phylogenetic relationships of extant and fossil species, thus making full use of morphological and temporal data, rather than just molecular sequence data from living species. Approaches combining fossil and extant taxa have opened the door for fully integrative phylogenetic methods that use more sources of biological data, including stratigraphy, sampling, and biogeography. Thus, there is a need for comprehensive statistical models and methods that accommodate this information. The investigators will develop new, Bayesian statistical models, extensions of stochastic birth-death processes, that will integrate information about the fossil record and biogeography for use in phylogenetic methods that consider both extant and fossil taxa. The new models will be implemented in the program RevBayes. The performance and adequacy of new and previously described models will be evaluated using simulated and empirical datasets. New methods will be used to investigate macroevolutionary patterns in two exemplar clades: Sphenisciformes (penguins) and Crocodyliformes, addressing key hypotheses about phylogenetic relationships, lineage diversification, and biogeography."

Because this research connects materials properties to mechanical performance, it is well-suited as the basis for interdisciplinary activities targeted to empower underrepresented minority students in science and engineering. <br/><br/>The friction and lubrication properties at the interface of soft hydrated materials determine the collective behavior of dense microgel systems, but friction is often treated as a simple function of slip velocity or shear rate. Materials-based lubrication theories for soft hydrated matter have recently emerged, along with experimental evidence of hydrogel surface wear. The research goal of this project is to discover the mechanisms of surface degradation in soft interfaces due to surface shear by applying, measuring in situ, and mapping the progression of mechanical degradation in slipping, low-friction hydrogel interfaces. Instrumented micro-tribometry, optical- and force-based microscopy, and micro-indentation will be employed to measure the progression of degradation. This knowledge will contextualize competing theories of hydrogel lubrication and catalyze hypotheses regarding chemical and physical degradation of hydrogels for emerging scientific, technological, and engineering design problems"

These teams will perform research on fabricated surfaces/structures whose feature size is on the order of tens of nanometers (nm). It is expected that these activities will achieve several key outcomes, including: (1) increased interest in research and development careers in fields such as engineering, physics, biology, and chemistry; (2) increased understanding of the role of interdisciplinary teams in solving complex problems and unique preparation for pursuing graduate studies within an interdisciplinary research environment; (3) increased understanding of the role of research and development in the commercial sector and its relation to national interests; (4) publications with the REU participant as the lead or co-author; and (5) the presentation of REU participants' research results at conferences. The overall objective of the site activities is to develop a pipeline, to train a diverse cadre of future researchers and faculty to continue innovative research ,and to address predicted shortages in the appropriate engineering disciplines.  <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION: Underpinning the REU site is the Center for Nanohybrid Functional Materials (CNFM) at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln (UNL). Research within the CNFM is organized around three complementary and mutually supporting research themes, as well as the development of research infrastructure through acquisition of specialized instrumentation within a core facility. The first research theme, Nanohybrid Fabrication, focuses on the preparation of highly ordered and spatially coherent 3D nanostructures, their hybridization with chemical or biological sensing elements, and their immobilization or inclusion within polymer matrices. In addition, this theme is also expanding to include preparation of 1- and 2-dimensional semiconductor materials decorated with organic materials. The second research theme, Nanohybrid Characterization and New Sensing Principles, focuses on new characterization and sensing principles based on unique properties of the nanohybrids, including techniques based upon Terahertz to UV ellipsometry. The third research theme, Nanohybrid-based Devices, focuses on potential sensing and separation applications based on molecular interactions within nanohybrid-based devices and 1-D and 2-D semiconductor/organic electronic devices. Students will be introduced into this environment with the primary goal to help the participants develop into effective, independent researchers in an interdisciplinary environment. The research activities are designed not only to develop skills germane to the student's field of study, but also to demonstrate how one project fits into a larger, more complex system. The REU participant will not simply be a ""lab helper"" who assists graduate students or postdoctoral researchers with laboratory chores, but will have significant and independent responsibilities in the research project."

Habitat loss and fragmentation -- the conversion of large areas into isolated smaller areas -- threaten the diversity of plant communities and ecosystem functions (essential services provided by plants). Thus, it important that we understand how to maintain plant communities and how they help ecosystems function. This project explores how seed dispersal in fragmented habitats helps sustain plant diversity and promote ecosystem functions such as nutrient cycles and decomposition rates.  Investigators will examine whether habitat fragmentation has an unusually large impact on the abundance of plant species that are poor seed dispersers and, if so, how loss of these species may result in loss of ecosystem function.  Scientists working on this project will engage with the public through talks, a workshop, and internship opportunities.  Results will help inform the U.S. Army Corp of Engineers and their mission of conservation. <br/><br/>Investigators will study impacts of habitat fragmentation on plant communities and ecosystem functions, using a set of islands in Lake Strom Thurmond, South Carolina. Plant communities, plant chemical and physical attributes, and soil properties will be measured on 20 islands of different levels of spatial isolation (near shore versus far from shore) and historic disturbance. Specifically, investigators will quantify the abundance and diversity of plant species, leaf properties of those species, soil nitrogen availability, and microbial decomposition rates. These data will be used to test the hypothesis that spatial isolation and disturbance affect ecosystem function by altering plant species composition. Statistical models will test 1) whether ecosystem carbon and nutrient fluxes are a function of spatial isolation, disturbance history, and leaf properties; and 2) whether dispersal limitation caused by island spatial isolation can drive functional composition."

These molecules affect a wide range of characteristics within streams such as the ability of light to penetrate the water and the acidity of the water.  The organic molecules also can provide streams with energy and essential nutrients such as nitrogen and phosphorus. One particularly important form of these organic molecules is dissolved organic nitrogen, which is found globally in forests, arctic tundra, estuaries and streams. However, very little is known about when and where dissolved organic nitrogen serves as a source of energy, a source of nitrogen, or both to biological communities. This project will examine the role of dissolved organic nitrogen in streams across five distinct forested regions spanning a diverse set of environments in an effort to shed light on the role of dissolved organic nitrogen. This research is relevant to water resources management because dissolved organic nitrogen is a source of excessive nutrient loading causing toxic algal blooms in estuaries, and when it is found in drinking water supplies it can produce, during water treatment, disinfection by-products that can harm human health.   This research will also integrate under-represented groups into the laboratory work and field work needed for the project and provide training opportunities for a graduate student and a post-doctoral scientist.<br/><br/>Differentiating among the competing roles for dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) is difficult, as direct manipulation of the DON pool in aquatic ecosystems is most easily accomplished by addition of specific compounds such as amino acids, which are commercially available but are not particularly representative of the DON found in streams and rivers under ambient conditions. Based on initial experimental results, the researchers will conduct a series of novel field manipulations in streams across New England, Puerto Rico, Spain, Czech Republic, and Siberia to better understand the extent to which DON serves as an energy source or nitrogen source in streams globally. Initial experimental observations in New England show that the DON can serve as both a nitrogen source and an energy source, but its role appears to vary over space and time. Here the researchers will perform additional experiments where nitrate pulses are added to streams across a global network to assess how frequently, and under what conditions, DON serves predominantly as a nitrogen source, versus an energy (carbon) source. This set of experiments will provide some of the first experimental evidence to assess the importance of these two competing drivers in regulating the levels of ambient DON in natural waters."

Mites, in particular, due to their small size and wide distribution are poorly known and likely to harbor many new species. This research focuses on documenting the diversity and evolutionary relationships among velvet mites, chiggers, and water mites (Parasitengona). These particular mites are often the most abundant animals in a given habitat and can be useful indicators of ecosystem health in streams and forests. They have interesting life cycles, with parasitic larvae and predacious nymphs and adults. The larvae of most species are parasites of other arthropods and have been shown to affect host populations by shortening host life and reproductive capability. The larvae of one group - chiggers - are parasites of vertebrates and occasionally bite humans, causing irritation and public health concerns. The predatory nymphs and adults play important ecological roles as well, but they are also the most familiar, with some species being the largest and most colorful of all mites. This project will contribute to mite biology, but also has an extensive citizen science component that will engage the public and allow them to contribute to the knowledge of mites living in their area. Additionally, the project will work with K-12 educators to develop projects focused on the diversity of insects, scorpions, crabs, mites, and related animals (Arthropods) that will introduce students to the scientific method and improve observational skills and critical thinking.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to integrate modern morphological and phylogenomic tools to develop a complete evolutionary picture of the largest radiation of mites, Parasitengona (velvet mites, water mites, and chiggers). The project will address this goal with two specific aims that will bridge the gaps in Parasitengona systematics and target key elements meant to reach broader audiences. The first aim is to create a robust phylogenetic hypothesis for Parasitengona using an anchored hybrid enrichment protocol to sequence approximately 1000 loci across 600 taxa. The resulting phylogenetic hypothesis will solidify the currently unstable classification and present a tool for testing many evolutionary questions, including two core events that have had the greatest impact on Parasitengona diversification: 1) the shift from predator to protelean parasite and subsequent host shifts; and 2) the invasion of freshwater. The second aim is to reconcile previous research on parasitengone morphology with modern approaches. An internal morphological survey will use modern non-destructive 3D imaging techniques such as confocal scanning microscopy to yield digital interactive models. An extensive external morphological survey using low-temperature scanning electron microscopy to gain unprecedented amounts of morphological information. Lastly, the project will integrate these new findings with legacy data into a matrix-format that will assist with understanding the evolution of the group and will be the first step to developing an online anatomy ontology for all mites. Overall, the project will produce an unparalleled amount of data for mites and develop a foundation for a multitude future research directions."

Most micro-nano mechanical systems use silicon beams as their structural components. These beams are typically subjected to bending during operation. But silicon is brittle at room temperature. This limits the design space of silicon devices. Bending, however, localizes high stresses near the surface of the beams close to the anchors. In addition, the stresses decrease from the surface towards the middle plane of the beam, giving rise to stress gradients. The effects of small size, stress localization and stress gradient on the failure mechanisms of silicon remain elusive to date. Recent evidence suggests that silicon at small scale can be ductile (i.e., not brittle) at very high yield stresses. If so, then small size, stress localization and stress gradients together may offer the virtues of both ductility and high strength to silicon. Such failure resistance would present a yet untapped paradigm to the design space of silicon devices. A detailed understanding of the failure and deformation mechanisms of silicon at small scale under bending would be transformative for both semiconductor physics and industry, and will be a fundamental advance for the field of mechanics. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to explore the mechanics and mechanisms of deformation and failure in small silicon samples under bending by combining theory and experiments. The working hypothesis of the project is that dislocation is the primary mechanism of deformation in silicon under bending at small scale. Small samples are dislocation free. Small size and stress localization in bending offer high flaw tolerance against fracture. This is due to the low probability of flaw incidence in the small stressed region. Bending results in dislocation nucleation from the surface before any flaw induced fracture. These dislocations enter the bulk yielding the silicon. But the yield stress increases with decreasing size due to stress gradient. This hypothesis will be tested by undertaking three tasks: (1) mechanistic modeling and molecular dynamics simulations of silicon samples under bending, (2) bending experiments on micro-nano fabricated single crystal silicon samples with various sizes and at different temperatures, and (3) in situ bending experiments in transmission electron microscopes (TEM) to reveal the mechanisms of deformation (in collaboration with Max Planck Institute at Dusseldorf, Germany). A novel micro mechanical stage will be developed for tasks 2 and 3. The research will be integrated with education and outreach activities involving K-12 to graduate students."

Crystal engineering is the design and synthesis of functional solid-state structures (e.g., new organic molecular crystals and metal-organic co-ordination polymers and other organic and inorganic framework solids (MOFs), based on a bottom-up approach from smaller building blocks such as neutral organic molecules, and organic or inorganic ions. Typical design strategies use hydrogen bonds and coordination bonds, which define sub-structural units that are called respectively, supramolecular synthons and secondary building units.

To reach the maximum potential of these applications, there is a need to discover materials that exhibit exciting optical and electronic properties while remaining part of a mechanically flexible system. Nanocrystals present an ideal system to investigate for this purpose, as they have tunable electromagnetic absorption and emission properties, are easy and inexpensive to make, and can be integrated into thin films on stretchable substrates. Despite this, there have been few studies on the deformation behavior of these systems. This award supports research to create thin films of luminescent nanocrystals on deformable and flexible substrates, to measure their optical and mechanical properties, and to describe and predict the behavior of these films during flexion/stretching.  The projected applications of these systems include forming optical metamaterials such as tunable gratings and filters, wearable sensors for body metrics, and flexible energy devices (e.g., light-emitting devices and solar photovoltaics). The research approach is to combine ideas across mechanical engineering, materials science, and nanotechnology to create a robust understanding of how layers of nanocrystals can be controllably deformed. This research will be used in year-round outreach events to inspire and educate future engineers including interactions with the general public and targeted events for underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Nanocrystals, used often in traditional rigid electronic devices, have the potential to withstand the strain of deformable device operation. Moreover, they can be made using environmentally friendly techniques and materials and exhibit exciting size-dependent properties such as luminescence. In addition, tunable wrinkling, due to instability formation, in thin films of nanocrystals on pre-stretched elastomeric substrates can be used to generate new electromagnetic and acoustic meta-materials. The problem is that the mechanical responses of nanocrystal films to stretching/flexion of the film substrate are almost completely unknown. This research will be devoted to experimentally and theoretically filling this knowledge gap. The research will include experimental studies on the mechanical behavior and instability formation in nanocrystal/substrate systems, depending on nanocrystal size and film porosity/thickness. These studies will be complemented by theoretical modeling of the mechanical properties of the systems to describe the instability formation.  The research will then be integrated and used for predicting and designing the instabilities in nanocrystal films with ultimate application areas in stretchable electronics, sensors, and optical/acoustic metamaterials."

For example, membranes used in clean water applications are comprised of thin polymer layers through which water is pushed to separate and remove unwanted contaminants.  Although currently useful, this technology remains energetically unfavorable due to engineering limits with regard to the mechanical strength of polymer thin films.  Beyond membranes, the efficiency and lifetime of many other applications are also limited by the mechanical properties of polymer thin films; however, direct knowledge of these properties in thin films is extremely limited. Changes in polymer materials when they are processed into films comprised of only a few molecules in thickness are well known, but how these changes impact mechanical strength remains unclear. The proposed project will overcome current challenges with directly measuring mechanical properties in ultra-thin polymers, leading to new fundamental data and knowledge that can help guide the design and synthesis of new materials for better membranes, alternative power sources, as well as many other technologies. The proposed research will provide a strong foundation for the education and training of multiple graduate students and undergraduate researchers. To extend the impact of this project to the K-12 education level, new materials science and engineering curriculum materials will be developed to be integrated into a workshop, called BioInspire!. This program is designed to teach lessons of materials science and engineering and biology in the context of bioinspired innovation, where science, engineering, and art can be used to engage a broad, diverse group of students.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This project will develop fundamental knowledge of the polymer physics associated with the mechanical properties in ultra-thin films of polymer glasses.  Although changes in the mobility of glassy polymer chains in a surface-dominated regime has been studied extensively, the mechanical properties in ultrathin polymer films have only been studied to a limited extent. Here, a new measurement device, called the Ultrathin Film Tensile tester (UFT), will be used to measure the complete stress-strain relationship for polymer thin films under uniaxial extension conditions. The proposed measurements will provide a complete understanding of mechanical responses in ultra-thin polymer films by quantifying elastic and dissipative processes through monotonic and cyclic loading histories across a wide strain and temperature range, as well as controlled fracture experiments in the dimensionally-constrained regime. Three materials systems, including polystyrene (PS), polycarbonate (PC), and blends of polystyrene and poly(2,6-dimethyl-1,4-phenylene oxide) (PS/PPO), will be studied, allowing molecular structure and mechanical responses to be tuned systematically. The findings are expected to provide new insight with regards to how polymer mobility changes near a surface can alter the constitutive response of a polymer, how changes in entanglement density due to dimensional geometric constraints alters fracture mechanisms, and how geometric constraints on polymer molecules may alter the onset of dissipative or plastic deformations. The findings from this project will have a significant impact on fundamental polymer physics, as well as on the development of new characterization methods that can aid the development of advanced materials for thin film applications."

For over 50 years, it is has been common practice in the agricultural industry to add low doses of traditional (i.e., ""medically important"") antibiotics to animal feed to improve production efficiency of food animals. While these ""antibiotic growth promoters"" provide tremendous economic benefit, this practice also leads to antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains which have the potential to infect humans. As a result, the US Food and Drug Administration has implemented measures to stop this practice. While numerous alternatives to medically important antibiotics have been proposed, most have not been commercially successful as they are not adequately effective. As an alternative to medically important antibiotics, the use of antimicrobial proteins has great promise, but a significant limitation to their commercial production has been cost. Thus the ability to economically manufacture antimicrobial proteins would represent a significant benefit to the agricultural industry as it would allow farmers to maintain high levels of productivity while not generating antibiotic-resistant strains that pose a danger to humans. This proposal explores the potential of replacing medically-important antibiotic feed-additives with antimicrobial protein (AMP). Work described here seeks to generate proof-of-concept data, expressing model AMPs, at commercially viable titers, using recombinant filamentous fungi.<br/><br/>This project employs a commercially-relevant fungal species (Aspergillus niger), to express model endolysin proteins with demonstrated bactericidal activity. To increase both expression and extracellular secretion of two different endolysin enzymes several approaches will be used, exploring the impact of genomic location, transcriptional promoter, and secretion signal sequence. Employing several approaches will increase the likelihood for success and will also allow identification of the most relevant factors leading to a high-producing recombinant fungal strain. This understanding will allow efficient generation of additional production strains for different proteins or peptides. In addition, personnel involved in this project, both a postdoctoral scientist and several undergraduate students, will be trained in a cross-disciplinary environment that will increase their research capacity. Personnel will also participate in entrepreneurial education experiences, through conducting customer discovery activities related to this project. This will primarily involve contacting potential stakeholders, along the entire value chain, to test hypotheses related to future commercialization."

Recruitment specifically will focus on women, underrepresented minorities, persons with disabilities and students from colleges and universities where research opportunities in STEM are limited. All the REU Site projects are related to the area of transportation electrification, which acts as a common intellectual focus. The program will enhance the practical and theoretical foundation of students in the areas of power electronics, energy storage (battery, ultra capacitor and fuel cell), controls, optimization and mathematical modeling of grid integrated vehicles, and sustainable transportations by exploring creative, original, and transformative concepts. Over 40% of green house gas and 70% of emissions come from transportation which is largely dependent on one source of fuel, which is petroleum.  Electrification of transportation is one of the ways to become independent of oil.  The main broader impact of this REU program is ensuring the highest quality integrated education and research to meet the emerging workforce and educational needs of U.S. automotive and energy industries by educating young and talented undergraduate students in this field.  It is essential to point out that since the transportation industry is going through a major restructuring it is critical to train young minds in this field. The integrated research and educational activities of this REU Site will certainly facilitate this objective. <br/><br/>Over a three year period, this REU Site program will engage undergraduate students in a 10-week intensive, summer research experience focused on sustainable transportation systems. The primary objectives of this REU program are to 1) annually recruit undergraduate students specifically from underrepresented groups and institutions with limited research opportunities, train them in basic research and provide laboratory experience in transportation electrification-related engineering projects, 2) promote the skills to become a successful researcher by providing insights into research methodologies, self-discipline, team integration, reporting and exchanging new<br/>knowledge, 3) expose students to the broader implications of their research, 4) help students prepare for graduate school and define career pathways, 5) integrate ethics discussion and training into all aspects of their experience, 6) develop collegial interactions between students and faculty and between students themselves, 7) increase the number of students, specifically from underrepresented groups, pursuing graduate studies in the field of transportation electrification, and 8) provide opportunities for participants to present and publish their work with faculty mentors."

Deformation processes such as extrusion, rolling, sheet-metal working, and forming methods are typically used to shape components from these metallic systems during manufacturing. The surface quality attributes of components, such as defects, finish and strength, created by the processes is to a large extent determined by the nature of metal flow at the surface. This surface flow also plays a major role in controlling friction and wear at the forming interfaces. For these reasons, there is a critical need for studying the fundamental nature of the flow in deformation processing so that component and product quality can be enhanced by suitable control of the flow. This award will address this need by supporting research to advancing the state-of-the-art of manufacturing process technologies in key industrial sectors. Complementing the research is an education program involving undergraduate researchers in creating a video gallery of flows for industry, and a modest focus on fostering entrepreneurship in graduate study. <br/><br/>The research will study a model process system - a hard die (wedge) sliding against a workpiece - with three coordinated thrusts.  Firstly, a deformation science initiative will utilize in situ observational techniques for high-resolution analysis of flow at workpiece surfaces and contacts. Flow phenomena (e.g., laminar, sinuous, instabilities), strain and strain rate fields, at the surfaces will be analyzed as a function of controllable process parameters. The interplay between flow type, friction, and defect formation will be explored. Secondly, workpiece surface quality will be examined in terms of microstructure, defect structures, mechanical properties, and topography. The surface quality attributes will be correlated with the flow fields. Thirdly, surface flow will be modeled using continuum approaches that incorporate material heterogeneity and grain level structure. By integrating the analyses results, a processing map, that demarcates flows and defects in terms of key material and process parameters, will be created. The study will be conducted specifically on model low-density structural alloys of aluminum, magnesium and titanium, selected for their experimental suitability and direct relevance to weight reduction in the discrete products sector. The techniques and findings will impact areas as diverse as materials processing, tribology, plasticity, and geophysical folding phenomena."

In humans, chronic sleep loss (insomnia, shift work, sleep apnea) has negative consequences on normal physiological and mental function and is a risk factor for many chronic conditions, such as metabolic and cardiovascular diseases. In the Arctic, migratory songbirds are active for 20 hours/day to take advantage of constant summer light, and seemingly do not suffer from the well-known detrimental effects of sleep loss, such as physiological and cognitive dysfunction. This research aims to investigate sleep patterns and assess the costs and benefits of sleep loss in arctic-breeding songbirds in Barrow, Alaska (71°N). Broader impacts of the proposal include training the next generation of science teachers to provide instruction to K-12 students of rural Alaska, engaging students (high school, undergraduate, and graduate) and postdoctoral trainees from traditionally underrepresented backgrounds in collaborative research, and disseminating research findings to scientists and the general public.<br/><br/>Sleep is essential for most organisms, although its precise function is enigmatic. Chronic sleep loss is well known to have detrimental effects on human health and performance. However, other species display a diversity of sleep patterns that challenge the assumption that reduced sleep is costly for all vertebrates. This proposal takes advantage of state-of-the-art miniaturized transmitters to assess sleep architecture in free-ranging songbirds. Arctic-breeding passerines exhibit extended wakefulness during migration and are active 20 hours/day on their breeding grounds where continuous daylight prevails. The project aims to investigate the sleep/wake cycles of two species of songbirds with different life-history strategies that breed in the high Arctic (Barrow, Alaska, 71° N).  It is hypothesized that both natural and sexual selection play a role in determining their sleep patterns. Next, daily sleep will be experimentally increased or decreased to assess life-history tradeoffs with fecundity and/or survivorship.  Lastly, the hypothesis will be tested whether arctic-breeding songbirds are more resilient to metabolic, cognitive, hormonal, and immunological costs of sleep loss compared with temperate-breeding birds in captivity. Broader impacts include a Future Teachers of Science program that fosters training of science teachers to develop teaching modules for K-12 students of rural Alaska and a cross-cultural research program for high school students of Alaska and Kentucky to assist with field research. Results from the research will contribute to our understanding of how arctic-dwelling species, including humans, cope with continuous periods of arctic light."

Critics claim that this transformation represents a new era of enclosures and constitutes a ""global land grab,"" which has negative effects on social equity and environmental sustainability. Advocates acknowledge the impacts of the changes but argue in turn that agricultural commodity production represents the most efficient use of the resource base in many developing countries, and their best hope for economic modernization. Social scientists who seek to understand the impacts of these transformations on rural people have likewise been divided. Many studies have focused on the economic marginalization that accompanies loss of land and the transition from mixed subsistence economies to dependence on wage labor. Yet some researchers have demonstrated that various indicators of well-being in fact improve as rural residents become more integrated with national markets. This award supports scientific research on this debate: Is agricultural conversion and restructuring good for local people or not? Because this process occurs throughout the world, including in the United States where it has been ongoing for over a century, it is important to have a better understanding of its consequences. <br/><br/>The research will use Cambodia as a manageable and appropriate test case; there, smallholder farmers have lost their traditional resource base and have been relegated to the in-between spaces at the edges of the new enclosures. Dr. Jonathan Padwe (University of Hawai'i at Mânoa) will survey land-use patterns and well-being across a series of highland villages. He will collect data to inform both sides of the debate: fine-scaled study of land-holding, resource use, and social differentiation as well as data on nutrition, well-being, and household economy.  The study will make synchronic and diachronic measurements of the impact of new land regimes. Synchronic analysis involves the study of land use and well-being across a range of villages, from those that are directly affected to those that are indirectly affected. Diachronic analysis involves the comparative study of land use and well-being in a single village where ten-year longitudinal data are available. Findings from this research will contribute to our understanding of the impacts of the transition to plantation-based commodity production at a human scale, informing both theoretical debates and development policy on an issue of global importance."

KU has an extensive history of paleontological research and collection stewardship back to the late 1800s. Paleontological collections represent an invaluable resource for studying past biodiversity and tracing the evolution and relationships of groups of organisms through time. Such collections represent an irreplaceable record of past life and their proper maintenance is especially crucial in cases where collection sites are no longer accessible, where they contain evolutionarily important organisms, or represent a unique record of Earth history. This project will provide funding for a compactor storage system for fossil plant specimens that are currently in unsuitable storage and inaccessible. The KU Paleobotany Division has a long, successful history of outreach programs that use specimens from the collection. Activities that this project will engage in include: recruitment/retention of underrepresented minority and female graduate/undergraduate students and postdoctoral scholars; workshops for middle school girls using female role models and hands-on science activities; subject-based (paleobotany, environmental change, Antarctica) workshops for various groups (TRIO program for inner-city students from Kansas City; home-schooled students; gifted students from Topeka PS); participation in Natural History Museum Public Education programs (fossil identification day, Darwin Day); collection tours; public lectures; permanent and temporary displays in the Museum; and teaching paleobotanical techniques to school children and the public. This project will include a Museum Studies student who will develop a virtual exhibit based on the newly accessible fossils.<br/> <br/>The paleobotany collections have greatly exceeded current space in Haworth Hall (biology labs, offices) and specimens are scattered in storage areas and the paleobotany research laboratory. Specimens will be moved into newly renovated space on West Campus, where many other Natural History collections are housed. The Paleobotany Division contains more than 100,000 specimens. KU houses the largest collection of Antarctic fossil plants in the world. These fossils provide calibration points for molecular clocks, molecular phylogenies, and extinction and dispersal events. The current project includes Permian, Triassic, and Jurassic fossil plants from Antarctica, and orphaned collections from Ohio University (OU), which were moved to KU in 2012. The latter includes Paleozoic plants from Appalachia and the Midcontinent, as well as Oxroad Bay, Scotland. Together with collections already at KU, this acquisition forms an unparalleled resource of the history of seed plants, from the earliest accepted fossils to the evolution of modern groups. The OU collection also includes plants from rare, seasonally dry (""upland"") floras from North American communities during glacial times in Gondwana; some of these sites are no longer accessible for collection. The Antarctic fossils that need proper storage represent a unique, anatomically detailed record of Paleozoic - Mesozoic plants and fungi at a time before and after end-Permian extinctions - the largest extinctions in Earth history. The Jurassic plants represent the only substantial deposit of Jurassic plants on continental Antarctica and are an important record of plant diversity and paleoclimate at the time of the breakup of Gondwana. Results of project will be shared with iDigBio (idigbio.org) and made available online (biodiversity.ku.edu/paleobotany)."

To demonstrate the effectiveness of these methods, the resources developed in this research will be used to study the plant's immunity to a virus infection under several conditions. Understanding how and when the virus overcomes the plants defenses gives us a handle on controlling an important pathogen of crop plants in the Southern US, with benefits such as better yield and less pesticide use. While biologists can measure the presence and amounts of tens of thousands of molecules in a cell all at once, understanding how they are connected, the 'networks' or 'systems' that lead to function, is a much harder problem. The huge amounts of measurements have to be properly managed so they are usable, and additional information has to be correctly added: it is important to track how amounts of one type of molecule change over time and not mix up different things. It is also important to understand which parts of the cell affect one another: those that belong to a functionally connected pathway (or network), and which are independent of each other. For example, plants have complicated mechanisms to defend themselves against biological and environmental stresses. Signaling pathways cause the plant's response, and they are influenced by internal genetic factors as well as the external ones that are more easily observed. If every protein (or other molecule) inside the cell that plays a part in carrying and interpreting the signal is known then very effective predictions about the final response are possible. However, plant researchers don't know nearly as much about the molecules in their organisms as is available to many researchers studying animals, which means there are a lot of missing nodes. That makes it hard to come up with a specific prediction that can be tested: this research aims to overcome this problem for selected plant pathways, to showcase what is possible when there is sufficient information. This project will actively engage students in interdisciplinary research, with a particular focus on recruiting underrepresented groups. The University of Texas at San Antonio (UTSA) is a Hispanic-Serving Institution. <br/><br/><br/>This project has the following four specific aims: 1) to construct genome-wide transcriptional regulatory network in Arabidopsis with validation in immune-responsive genes; 2) to improve the prediction of protein-protein interactions and identification of defense subnetworks in Arabidopsis; 3) to perform network-based analysis of Arabidopsis immune-responsive network in order to decipher the role of plant viral RNA silencing suppressors in plant immunity; and 4) to provide online databases and analytic tools for network-based plant systems biology studies. This project promises to significantly improve network-based analysis with several innovative ideas. First, the proposed approaches focus on improving accuracy of predictions for individual genes by defining a network neighborhood for each node and testing for enrichment in the neighborhood for each node. This is in contrast to most existing approaches that make predictions on gene modules (within- or cross-species) and therefore lack quality control on an individual gene level. Second, combining protein-protein interaction network, gene co-expression network, and sample-sample network, this research provides an example to analyze such networks in a dynamic context automatically defined by the global transcriptomic landscape; as such, this study is expected to provide more specific predictions that can be experimentally tested. In addition, integration of computational tools to characterize defense-related network structure in this work will significantly improve the ability to study the role of co-regulated networks of genes in any number of processes, including but not limited to genes implicated in both plant and animal disease, cancer or stem cell biology, or tissue specificity of gene expression.

Microbes evolve under the pressure of environmental stresses, such as climate change and pollution; these changes have global impact. For both microbes and their communities (or microbiomes), understanding the consequences of large-scale changes on microbes requires that we understand their starting point under normal conditions. In this project, normal baselines will be defined showing the functional abilities of microbes in a community and environment. Microbes will be grouped into similar functional classes, the 'distance' between two classes will include all of the differences in their functional abilities, which indicates their lifestyle preferences under existing conditions. In this way, a microbial class becomes a small set of shared functions, and is the basis for a novel way to infer microbial and microbiome diversity. The shared functions will serve as a guide to discovering new functional pathways or new members of known pathways, which can lead to broader impacts in a number of industrial applications. The technical advances produced through this project will include developing new algorithms, and combining new and existing data types, for the exploration of the microbial world. Building on principles shared between biology and computer science, the project will contribute to advances in knowledge extraction and graph analysis. Through education and outreach having hands-on lab activities the project will enhance bioinformatics education of undergraduates, urban high school students, and community lab members, while training postdocs to teach effectively. <br/><br/>Technical summary: Limited resolution of microbial taxonomy with regard to molecular functionality, calls for novel, fast, and reliable classifications, capturing microbial processes, diversity, and interactions. Researchers will computationally analyze existing microbial genomic data using a new metric of whole-organism molecular function similarity. Using this similarity metric, a new classification scheme will be built, defining microbial clades according to their functional capacities. This scheme will be reflective of heredity as well as other forms of genetic transfer and of environmental factors. This will also provide an opportunity to explore the influence of inheritance versus horizontal gene transfer in acquiring new functions. Based on the consistent co-occurrence of functions in microorganisms, common molecular pathways and minimal pathways required for life within specific environmental niches will be elucidated. The power of this approach is its ability to assign proteins to pathways that remain experimentally uncharacterized. Overlaying available annotations of microorganism habitat preferences (e.g. temperature, oxygen requirements, and pH), broadly explains metabolic end-points and unique environmental adaptations. The newly developed tools will be used to describe niche-specific microbiomes for precise analysis of the environmental effects, whether in natural processes or for synthetic function design and industrial process optimization. The specific goals of the project include: (i) develop a function-based organism similarity metric, facilitating a functional clade definition, (ii) identify core sets of functions most discriminative of clade assignment and, thus, most descriptive of environment requirements and (iii) enable fast and accurate metagenome diversity and functional ability analysis. All tools and other resources will be publicly accessible at www.bromberglab.org/services. Students will be included in formulating relevant scientific questions and trained in methods for answering them through the building, evaluating, and applying computational methods. Two postdocs will be trained to conduct this research and in educational methods for leading an associated course, the first bioinformatics methods design course at this institution. Undergraduate students will (i) acquire skills in quantitative biology for which (ii) impact will be measured for both understanding of bioinformatics and perception of research as a whole.

The project's curriculum development activities will contribute to STEM education by creating and sharing a hands-on workshop on genome bioinformatics in the research area. By integrating research and educational activities students will (i) gain science literacy in the areas of genetics and bioinformatics;  (ii) show how well hands-on methods work in genetics education; and (iii) use already performed genetic association studies to gain new knowledge in biology and in biomedicine.<br/><br/>This research will create and evaluate an integrative machine-learning model for identifying regulatory variants within human intergenic GWAS regions. The model's inputs will include the reference genome, the local DNA 3-D shape, phylogenetic conservation, and transcriptomic and epigenomic measurements. The model's output will be predicted regulatory variants with significance scores. The model will be benchmarked against published methods using ground-truth regulatory variants. The machine-learning model's variant predictions will be incorporated into an open-source, web-based software tool for integrative post-analysis of GWAS data. Compatibility with a cloud-computing framework will position the tool for maximum impact. Through educational activities that are integrated with the project's research activities, Dr. Ramsey will create, evaluate, and disseminate a Genome Bioinformatics Workshop unit for high school educators and students. Participants will learn to use the tool to analyze and explore human GWAS-identified regions for a model trait (height); through this they would be expected to gain a better understanding of the potential of the field of personal genomics. The workshop's materials will be developed within an interdisciplinary workshop incubator consisting of pairs of STEM-underrepresented CS and biology undergraduate summer students. We will create, evaluate, and disseminate the workshop unit in partnership with three outreach programs for STEM-underrepresented students. <br/>Project results will be made available at the project website: lab.saramsey.org/regulome"

Understanding how the abiotic environment, such as light or nutrient levels, changes from place to place and how individuals of multiple species are clustered is often overlooked, but is critically important. This research will develop a method to directly measure how structure in the abiotic environment and in the clustering of individuals promotes coexistence between species.  The scientific workforce will be strengthened through support for the education and training of a doctoral student and undergraduate students in theoretical and experimental ecology, and a high school teaching module will be developed to expose students to biological diversity experiments in ecology.<br/><br/>The role of landscape structure in promoting diversity will be examined by combining a laboratory experimental system of freshwater microorganisms with mathematical models.  Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) clustering of individuals will be the dominant mechanism leading to coexistence, and (2) stochasticity will reduce the strength of coexistence by weakening the effect of clustering. Diversity outcomes will be examined for multispecies communities of aquatic microorganisms in replicated laboratory experiments, where spatial structure, species abundance, dispersal, and abiotic conditions will be systematically manipulated. Mathematical models tailored to the experimental system will be developed to indirectly quantify and compare the contributions of different mechanisms of coexistence. The performance of the indirect method, which is commonly used for quantifying coexistence, will be assessed against the new experimental method developed. The proposed work will lead to a deeper understanding of how spatial structure promotes biodiversity."

If successful, it will provide a novel way to find solutions to the pressing societal problems of today's society. Additionally, through jointly exploring problem posing, the teams will gain confidence and the skills to tackle complex problems and uncover barriers to collaborating on complex, interdisciplinary problems that are of national and international importance.

The result of research in the middle and latter half of the Twentieth Century, these collections are irreplaceable, and illustrate anatomical features of wild, horticultural and crop plants as well as extinct fossil plants, from algae to pine trees to orchids.  In addition to documenting the original work of eminent plant scientists, the collection is a source of further investigation, rechecking of published information, and new studies.  Each slide required an extensive and labor-intensive process, from procurement of plant material (often from remote tropical regions), detailed preparation, embedding and sectioning, staining for optical clarity, and permanently mounting on glass slides.  Because of their great scientific value and connection to the history of plant anatomy and paleobotany, the collections are priceless and unique.  By stabilizing and preserving the slides, this project will save a valuable and irreplaceable resource for the scientific community.  The project will also image and database the slides and make these data available through the web to the general public and scientific community.  This public resource will allow college and high school teachers of biology, plant sciences, and forestry to access high-quality anatomical slides for demonstration without needing to purchase or prepare materials themselves.

These changes have been shown to be responsible for morphological, physiological, and behavioral differences, and to contribute to the diversity observed in nature. Advances in sequencing technology are making new genome data available at faster rates than ever before. As the number of species with sequenced genomes grows, so will the number of researchers wanting to take advantage of these valuable resources. They will come from a wide range of biological fields, and have an equally wide range of experience with computational tools. CAFE (Computational Analysis of gene Family Evolution) is a software package that allows researchers to better understand rates of gene gain and loss.  This project will result in a version of CAFE that adds to the national infrastructure by enabling new biological discoveries to the benefit of scientists working in many fields. CAFE will be a useful tool in science education, and will also improve and accelerate biological research that can be expected to have multiple societal benefits, including understanding the genetic basis for important biological phenotypes. A vigorous outreach and information dissemination plan will ensure that researchers and faculty engaged in research education are aware of CAFE and able to use it effectively, and will promote the development of a technology-savvy 21st century biology research community.<br/><br/>Studies of gene families are essential to a number of research areas, including gene regulation, human disease, and evolutionary genomics. CAFE enables these and other studies into cutting-edge areas by providing a likelihood method for analyzing gene gain and loss over a phylogeny. This method has been shown to work well with the error-prone genome assemblies currently available for most organisms, as well as when analyzing dozens of genomes at a time. This project will extend these capabilities to hundreds or thousands of genomes. To accomplish this goal, several of the maximum likelihood methodologies implemented by CAFE will be re-designed. These changes will include allowing rate variation among gene families, optimizing likelihood calculations on trees, and improving specification of several probability distributions used by these calculations. The quality of the code will be enhanced through best practices in software engineering and the development of better, faster, and more scalable supercomputer versions of the software.

To guard against this mutagenic outcome, cells have evolved mechanisms to interfere with transposable element mobilization. Previous work established a role for small RNAs in transposable element inhibition. This project will use modern genomics-enabled approaches in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, to conduct a 'severe test' of the assumptions and conclusions that led to the prevailing mechanistic view and to expand understanding of how transposable element silencing is triggered.  Because transposable elements are widespread in the genomes of both plants and animals, the results are expected to have broad impact in the field of regulatory biology. The project will also have strong educational impact, as it emphasizes data reproducibility and scientific ethics in three contexts: curricular enrichment for undergraduates who will integrate the research in their laboratory courses; annual outreach workshops for 7th grade minority students focused on science, technology, engineering and mathematics; and direct participation in research by early-career scientists at postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels.  <br/><br/>The mobility and mutagenic potential of transposable elements depends on mRNAs produced by synthesis of RNAs (transcription) from the elements themselves. This transcription step is a key control point for regulating transposable element mobility. Previous work has shown that transcription of transposable elements is turned off by small RNAs, which initiate silencing by a post-transcriptional interference mechanism that transitions to transcriptional-level silencing. This project will reproduce key aspects of that previous work and will apply modern technological capabilities to produce higher-value datasets that will be analyzed in creative and innovative ways to determine precisely how RNA interference is targeted to a particular transcript and how RNA-directed DNA methylation and transcriptional-level repression are established to produce trans-generational epigenetic silencing of transposable elements. Data and protocols will be broadly disseminated via open-access routes to enable the reproducibility of the research. The results should provide not only new understanding of how RNA-mediated silencing occurs, but also clues about how such silencing could be prevented. These insights could have practical consequences for genetically engineering plants with agronomic benefit."

Solar water splitting is a renewable energy source that could be used to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. In solar water splitting, sunlight energy is captured by turning water into hydrogen and oxygen gases. Hydrogen is a clean fuel that generates only water when burned. In this project, the PI and his team of student researchers will use computational modeling to predict high performance membrane materials for separating the gaseous products of solar water splitting.

They will further develop computational methods to model gas separations in membranes made from these materials.

The PI and students will research strategies to automatically parameterize flexible, polarizable force-fields from quantum chemistry calculations. These force-fields will be used in classical molecular dynamics and Monte Carlo simulations of metal-organic frameworks to compute gas diffusion constants and adsorption isotherms. A database of experimentally known metal-organic framework crystal structures will be screened to identify metal-organic framework-based materials suitable for purifying (a) helium from naturally occurring gas sources and (b) hydrogen gas from solar water splitting. Cryogenic distillation is currently the primary helium purification method. Using helium-selective membranes instead for all or portions of this purification could dramatically reduce energy requirements. Solar water splitting is an environmentally friendly and renewable hydrogen gas source. Wireless solar water splitting uses particles immersed in liquid to cogenerate a hydrogen and oxygen gas mixture with trace water vapor. Wireless solar water splitting could offer higher gas generation rates per volume than wired solar water splitting containing distinct anode and cathode compartments. This project will enable more widespread use of wireless solar water splitting (and wired solar water splitting with small anode-cathode gap distance) by identifying suitable metal-oxide framework-based materials for hydrogen-oxygen-water gas separations. Because constructing mechanically robust membranes from pure metal-oxide framework crystals is difficult, the PI will aim to predict easier-to-fabricate mixed matrix membranes containing metal-oxide framework crystals embedded in mechanically robust polymers. <br/><br/>Prior metal-oxide framework studies showed framework flexibility that sometimes impacts gas diffusion constants by orders of magnitude. The key scientific challenge is to develop computationally efficient, automated methods to construct accurate flexible force-fields. To achieve this, the PI's research team will combine (1) the Density Derived Electrostatic and Chemical method for computing net atomic charges and other atomic properties with (2) a modification of Tkatchenko-Scheffler self-consistent dispersion screening to compute polarizabilities and dispersion coefficients with (3) a modification of the quick force-field (QuickFF) method for computing flexibility parameters. By computing system-specific force-field parameters, this approach should achieve higher accuracy than generic force-fields. The computational methods developed in this project will be made publically available in software tools developed by the PI's group.<br/><br/>Educational activities are an important part of this project.

Hagness is proposing a project to develop and evaluate a radically new learning framework for engineering graduate students that is intended to cultivate a highly creative, innovative, and grand-challenge-focused research culture. The framework is based on mindfulness training: understanding the brain, emotional styles, and how they can be modified through meditation and other contemplative practices. The rationale for introducing engineering graduate students to contemplative practices stems from recent studies suggesting that mindfulness meditation improves insight problem solving, reduces cognitive rigidity, and positively impacts creativity outcomes, as well as increasing empathy and compassion. The underlying hypothesis is that cultivating creativity, innovation, intellectual risk-taking, altruism, and overall well-being ""through mindfulness training"" will collectively enhance graduate students' skills to conceive and conduct transformative research, and will motivate them to address societal challenges through the research problems they pursue.<br/><br/>Contemplative neuroscience research studies have demonstrated that brain plasticity can be exploited via mindfulness training to produce measurable effects on brain function, and physical and emotional well-being. The project represents an entirely new exploration of the potential role of mindfulness in cultivating attributes in the brain that are essential to conceiving and conducting transformative research with societal impact. The project will yield a scalable and adaptable curriculum for training engineering graduate students, integrated assessment tools suitable for evaluating creative capacity, emotional styles, and well-being, and documentation of the effectiveness of the proposed learning framework in enhancing graduate student ability and interest to conduct societally-focused transformative research."

By testing and improving the design steps it will also allow researchers and engineers to produce proteins that have functions more complex than could be made before: these new activities have enormous potential to advance basic research and biotechnology. Proteins perform a vast array of complex and important functions in cells and in technology settings: they can speed up the rate of chemical reactions by several hundred fold, they are responsible for how cells communicate, and they are the basic material for building cell structures and tissues. The advantages to designing proteins instead of using those already known include being able to modify what by-products are made so that there is less damage to the environment, make low-toxicity sensors that can probe the action of living cells in real time, and create unique materials that form defined structures at the nanoscale. To ensure the methods are widely available, all approved computational methods will be available as source code via the Rosetta software suite. This software is free of charge for academic users, and is commonly licensed by biotechnology and pharmaceutical companies. The new methods developed under this grant will also be used in classrooms for team-based projects and for interdisciplinary research activities that emphasize collaboration between students in the biological and physical/engineering sciences.<br/><br/>This research aims to address a principal barrier in computational protein design: the lack of computational approaches that predict both sequence and structural changes with sufficient accuracy. Design methods change the protein sequence but in the vast majority of cases allow only minimal structural adjustments. Yet conformational changes not captured by current methods are the rule rather than the exception, and a main reason for failed designs. Moreover, new conformations might be required to engineer new functions, e.g. to reshape an existing functional site to accommodate a different binding partner. Finally, many proteins undergo functional conformational changes, such as molecular switches or enzymes and protein machines that cycle between conformational states; such complex activities are currently not designable. Aim 1 seeks to advance methods to model changes in protein structure, and address challenges in both generating relevant protein conformations and distinguishing correct from incorrect predictions; established and new benchmarks will be used to assess limitations and quantify improvements. Aim 2 will develop an approach to design new functions that require substantial changes in protein conformation. The approach will be tested by experimental forward-engineering applications. Aim 3 will provide ""protocol capture"" documentation for tested methods and utilize developed methods in educational and research activities that seek to broaden participation.

As a result of global climate change, drought is becoming more prevalent world-wide, driving the need for insight into root architecture that maximizes water uptake that may lead to development of drought tolerant crops. This project explores how root architecture is controlled by flavonoids, which are chemicals made by plants that function as antioxidants. Flavonoid antioxidants reduce the levels of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which act as signaling molecules to help plants adapt to stressful growth conditions, but can become toxic at high levels. ROS signals play important roles in the response of plants to changes in light, temperature, and drought. This project examines how ROS-dependent signaling pathways are induced and how flavonoids limit these signals to prevent oxidative damage. The planned experiments will use plants with mutations that alter flavonoid synthesis to demonstrate when and where flavonoids alter ROS levels in roots and how the accumulation of flavonoids alters root architecture. This project will also explore the mechanisms by which ROS modulates activity of proteins and expression of genes. This project will also support the development of a case study exercise targeted to high school students, which teaches plant genetics and how plants respond to drought and the potential of conventional breeding and genetic engineering of plants to lead to drought tolerant crop varieties. The team will bring college students to high school classrooms to lead students through this curriculum to better understand these concepts and how they apply to agriculture. <br/><br/>This project will examine the role of reactive oxygen species (ROS) as signaling molecules that control root development and examine how flavonoids scavenge ROS to modulate development. This project applies genetic, molecular biological, and biochemical approaches to examine and manipulate the flavonoid biosynthetic pathway in the model plant species of Arabidopsis thaliana to ask whether flavonoid effects on root architecture are the result of their antioxidant action. We have in hand mutants with defects at most steps in flavonoid biosynthesis, which we will use to determine which flavonoids control root architecture. We will localize and quantify ROS using confocal microscopy with a probes that detect specific reactive oxygen species to determine whether ROS accumulation and distribution are modulated by the different flavonoid accumulation profiles found in these mutants. We will use genetic and chemical approaches to manipulate the levels of ROS and ROS scavengers to demonstrate that flavonoid/ROS interplay is directly linked to root development. Finally, we will identify the mechanisms by which flavonoid-modulated ROS controls root development by exploring changes in transcriptional networks and using an unbiased proteomic approach to identify proteins that are reversibly modified by ROS in a flavonol-dependent mechanism. The function of ROS regulated gene products or ROS oxidized proteins will then be tested using a mutant approach."

Collections are especially important in predicting biodiversity change with shifts in climate and land use. The Herbarium at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden (RSABG) houses more than 1.2 million specimens and is heavily utilized for research, education, and public outreach. From multiple sources, the Herbarium acquired 30,000 plant specimens collected by ten significant 20th century botanists. 70% of these were collected from 15 of 34 designated world biodiversity hotspots; 30% represents the California Floristic Province biodiversity hotspot. These specimens are in critical need of curation owing to poor storage conditions. Several specimens have been identified as critical for describing and naming species new to science. Curation of these collections will provide physical access to collections currently unavailable for study, promote discovery of species new to science, and yield new distribution and phenology data. Importantly, curation will ensure critically needed preservation. Digitization efforts will provide access of this rich source of specimen data to researchers, students, and the public. Integral to the project are activities involving the participation of graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students. Notably, RSABG will expand on a successful undergraduate internship program by engaging underserved youth from the Greater Los Angeles metropolitan area. Especially targeted are at-risk and transitional aged youth at the high school level, who will be trained in a six-week summer junior intern program. All interns will participate in five workshops that will serve to connect students to collections, natural history, and biodiversity. An exhibit at RSABG will highlight the activities and student participation in the project.<br/><br/>As herbaria serve expanding needs for research, education, and conservation management, it is critical that collections of historic, taxonomic, and geographic significance are curated and digitized, ensuring their availability for research through investments in their long-term security. Through various sources, the Herbarium at Rancho Santa Ana Botanic Garden acquired 30,000 vascular plant specimens of historic, taxonomic, and geographic importance representing the collections of ten significant botanists of the 20th century. These specimens are in danger of deterioration, owing to unsatisfactory past and current storage conditions (e.g., non-archival newspapers). Thus, these collections are in critical need of curation and improved storage to secure them for posterity. Several specimens have been identified as type material that was thought to have been lost. The principal objective of this three-year project is to curate and digitize these specimens through student participation. A large cadre of students at different levels in their academic career will participate in all aspects of the project, including specimen preparation, databasing, imaging, and georeferencing. Specimen data will become available for more than 18,000 species of vascular plants in ~350 families. All data resulting from this project will be shared with iDigBio, GBIF, the Consortium of California Herbaria, and the RSABG Herbarium web portal. Additional information about RSABG, its outreach activities, and the results of this project is available at http://www.rsabg.org."

Recent decades have seen large scale changes of species' geographic ranges, as introductions of invasive species and shifting climate patterns displace organisms from ancestral areas and expand into new regions. Many previous models of range movement rely only on ecological processes while ignoring evolution; recent research, however, suggests that evolution at the expanding range edge might play a key role. Range shifts have important conservation and economic implications that will be informed by these studies. The researchers also conduct a workshop course for K-12 teachers and provide curriculum materials to examine range shifts as a teaching tool. <br/><br/>Several hypotheses will be tested by quantifying patterns in allele frequencies through space and time using flour beetles stored from an already completed laboratory range expansion experiment. The hypotheses to be tested are that (1) core and edge locations of a species range should grow increasingly genetically distinct through time, (2) they should accumulate different genetic variants, with edges containing variants associated with high colonization ability, and (3) the speed of range expansion should correlate with these evolved genetic patterns. Whole genome sequencing will be used to quantify allele frequencies among beetles sampled at different times and locations during the range expansion. The results will not only provide insights into the role of spatial structure in evolution, but they will also have significance for management of invasive species and species shifting ranges due to climate change."

Similar to other types of connections or so-called synapses between neurons, electrical synapses are known to undergo changes in strength.  However, the specific conditions that result in plasticity or changes in strength of electrical synapses are unknown. This project investigates the specific neuronal activity rules and underlying mechanisms whereby these synapses are modified by ongoing brain activity.  Further, this project aims to advance our understanding of how these activity-dependent modifications of electrical synapse strength impact brain function, in particular that processing of sensory information via the thalamus to the cortex. The findings will yield important new insights into the function of electrical synapses and their plasticity across the brain, and how the brain gates cortical attention to the sensory environment surrounding the organism.  The project involves a combination of brain research, undergraduate and graduate training in neuroscience concepts and research techniques, and educational development through special institutional programs aimed at disadvantaged children and youth, with a goal of public education and broadening participation in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM disciplines) by traditionally underrepresented students.<br/><br/>	Learning rules and mechanisms for long-term synaptic modification have been described extensively for neurotransmitter-based synapses. However, strikingly little is yet known about activity-dependent plasticity of electrical synapses, also known as gap junctions. Because electrical synapses are widespread but their importance in mammalian brain function, it is critical that we advance our understanding of whether and how these types of essential synapses are regulated in a use-dependent manner.  The central hypothesis of this project is that the strength of electrical synapses in the thalamic reticular nucleus, the major inhibitory regulator of cortico-thalamic communication, is continuously updated by activity in electrically coupled neurons; in turn, this plasticity alters the synchrony within and the inhibitory output of the thalamic reticular nucleus. To test this hypothesis, the control and the impact of electrical synaptic plasticity is investigated using in vitro electrophysiology and optogenetic techniques. Aim 1 examines the mechanisms that underlie plasticity of electrical synapses, with the goal of elucidating and developing predictions about the relationship between activity and synaptic strength. Aim 2 measures the impact of electrical synaptic plasticity on synchrony within networks of coupled thalamic neurons, and thereby offers new insight into the inhibition that coupled interneurons deliver to their downstream targets. Aim 3 tests the functional role of electrical synapse plasticity in brain rhythms and network plasticity.  Together, the studies will lead to novel understanding of how electrical synapses contribute to brain function."

Computer simulations provide powerful insight for addressing technological challenges and for guiding the design of novel materials with desired properties.  While simulations with atomically detailed models are often very accurate, they do not provide the necessary efficiency for addressing the long length and time scales that are relevant for materials design.  In contrast, lower resolution coarse-grained models provide superior efficiency, but currently provide limited accuracy and often require extensive parameterization for each new system and environment.  Professor Noid and his coworkers develop theoretical methods for improving the accuracy of coarse-grained models, as well as for extending their range of applicability. Additionally, Professor Noid organizes an intergenerational science club that promotes life-long scientific education within the broader community, while integrating students of all ages into the scientific enterprise.  <br/><br/>This project develops and validates a van der Waals (vdW) approach for improving both the transferability and also the thermodynamic properties of bottom-up multiscale methods.  Motivated by an exact decomposition of the many-body potential of mean force, which is the correct potential for a coarse-grained (CG) model.  This model perfectly reproduces both the structural and thermodynamic properties of an underlying atomistic model.  The vdW approach: (1) adopts leading variational methods to determine effective potentials that accurately describe structural properties and (2) develops new variational methods to accurately model thermodynamic properties.  In particular, the work extends a pressure-matching variational principle for modeling density fluctuations in inhomogeneous and interfacial systems.  The comparison of potentials obtained from different variational approaches provides insight into their entropic components and allow for predictive estimates of their transferability. Ultimately, this work may develop predictive CG models for exceedingly accurate and efficient simulation studies of mesoscale self-assembly at aqueous interfaces and conduction in polymer-based batteries."

Depletion of the ozone layer occurs through a series of chemical reactions in which ozone molecules are destroyed by reacting with halogens (chlorine, bromine, etc.) with some of the halogens originating from man-made halocarbons. These reactions are enhanced with cold temperatures at stratospheric altitudes. Current computer models are capable estimating the magnitude of ozone hole development in the stratosphere over the polar regions, but the models underestimate the amount of stratospheric cooling as compared to measurements made by ground-based remote-sensing LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) instruments. This project seeks to better understand the role of atmospheric gravity waves in the Earth's stratosphere and their potential effects on the Antarctic ozone layer. Accurate forecasts of the Antarctic ozone hole parameters by coupling atmospheric chemistry and climate models are critical for monitoring ozone hole recovery. This, in turn, is important for understanding whether or not the goals of the Montreal protocol are being met.<br/><br/>The high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model will be used to account for effects of atmospheric gravity waves that propagate upward in the lower atmosphere and, therefore, affect atmospheric circulation, stratospheric temperature, and consequently behavior of the Antarctic ozone layer. A number of Antarctic ground-based lidar data (from McMurdo, South Pole, Davis, Syowa stations, and past observations at Rothera Station) will be used to validate and examine the WRF modeling results. The enhanced gravity wave parameterization will be used to run ""The Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model"" (WACCM) to study the stratospheric circulation and temperatures above Antarctica. This research effort is a cost-effective investment that will advance the state of knowledge of lower atmosphere dynamics and improve or correct parameterization of gravity waves and, thereby, improve models of the lower atmosphere. In turn this will improve understanding of how lower atmosphere processes can affect ozone depletion reactions. The award will support an early career female scientist with her first NSF funding, as well as support an undergraduate student."

Namely, are there types of support structures that are more or less effective at producing and facilitating the transfer of these valuable resources to and within movements? Contemporary legal movements provide a unique opportunity to address this question, as their patrons have, since the late-1990s, invested in support institutions representative of three different types - Leveraging, Supplemental, and Parallel Alternative Structures. <br/><br/>This study uses this variation to help forward two models for understanding and assessing the efficacy of different support structure strategies.

PIs will analyze these data both qualitatively and quantitatively, with the primary methods involving interpretive data analysis and network mapping. This project will provide important insights for scholars and practitioners and will have at least two significant impacts. First, through the development of new models for understanding movements, this project will make a theoretical contribution to the scholarly literature on support structures, legal mobilization, and social movements. Secondly, policy activists who have learned that a support structure is necessary for legal change have little guidance from the literature as to what kinds of support structures will best facilitate the transfer of resources between their movement and policy demanders.

Understanding of biochemical and cellular processes has profited enormously from the development of high resolution fluorescence techniques. Total internal reflection (TIRF) microscopy is a technique that allows high resolution imaging of a thin layer of the cell close to the plasma membrane and has become a standard technique to study membrane proteins. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy (FCS) provides the capability to extract dynamics from single biological molecules in vitro and in cells yielding crucial insights into their inherently heterogeneous and complex nature. One of the primary limitations of these techniques is that they are highly labor intensive and thus have been primarily restricted for single sample analysis followed by costly manual data processing.  The proposed instrument will overcome these challenges by developing high throughput versions of both techniques under a single, cost-effective imaging and data collection platform. In addition, a new analysis package Open Fluorescence Spectroscopy (OpenFS), to be developed by researchers and computer scientists,  will be open-source and made freely available online, providing an alternative to costly and proprietary imaging software that is often tied to a particular device.  Research enabled by this instrument spans the disciplines of chemistry, physics, molecular biology, and engineering to answer fundamental questions in biology.  The ability to perform multiple and single molecule studies at high throughput has the capacity to accelerate basic scientific discoveries essential to the biosciences.  The multidisciplinary nature of this project will also create unique training and educational opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and post-doctoral researchers.  <br/><br/>The ability to resolve structural rearrangements, biomolecular interactions, and binding kinetics of complex systems is essential to the research aims across multiple disciplines of study including biology, chemistry, engineering, and physics. Imaging of fluorescent biomolecules in their natural cellular environment to obtain quantitative information about their dynamic behavior is essential for further understanding their roles in cellular processes.  The goal of this project is to develop a unique, versatile, and multi-faceted platform that will extend high temporal and spatial imaging for high throughput TIRF and FCS.  The instrument will be able to function in multiple high throughput modes and provide the tools to extract a broad range of biomolecular dynamics using ensemble and single-molecule fluorescence measurements in polymeric, reconstituted, or cellular systems.  Due to the multi-modal capabilities of the instrument, a new open-source fluorescence spectroscopy analysis package, Open Fluorescence Spectroscopy (OpenFS), will be developed offering offers reusable software modules for processing of fluorescence spectroscopy data. The instrument will conduct high-throughput, high sensitivity studies in a cost-effective and user friendly format that has the potential to transform studies of biomolecular dynamics and allow the extension of TIRFM and FCS to applications previously inaccessible."

Atypical Gulf Stream position, air-sea heat flux, extremes in ocean temperature, and sea level rise are potential harbingers of larger shifts in atmospheric and oceanic forcing. Effects on shelf-deep ocean exchange are unknown due to incomplete dynamical understanding of the present. Development of predictive capacity is particularly relevant at this time, as oil and gas exploration is being planned. The understanding of shelf-deep ocean exchange gained through this project will be applicable to other regions where shelf and basin-scale currents converge and could improve our capacity to anticipate the response of the coastal ocean to climate change in the coming decades. In addition to the physical interactions between scales and oceanic regions, the relevance of exported shelf waters at Cape Hatteras to global carbon budgets may be large, and is difficult to quantify due to carbon budget mediation by biological ecosystems that vary with season and water mass. Both ecosystems and export processes may change under predicted climatic shifts, so understanding export processes has broad biogeochemical importance. Collaborations with biogeochemists and ecologists will be pursued to utilize the data to study ecosystems in this area of high biological diversity that is home to many commercially important species. Insights gained through the project will also improve mitigation of pollutant spills. The outreach and educational efforts include a public exhibit and talks, opportunities for joining science cruises and participation in the Society of Women Engineers ""Girls Engineer It! Day"", a daylong event for girls in grades 6-12, and the Wood Hole Oceanographic Institution's summer program for undergraduates from underrepresented groups. The project will support two early career scientists, train one postdoctoral researcher and four graduate students, and give undergraduate students hands-on experience in the operation of the autonomous gliders.<br/><br/>Subtropical and subpolar oceanic gyre boundaries are characterized by confluent western boundary currents and convergence in the adjacent shelf and slope waters. Together, they lead to large net export of shelf waters to the deep ocean, and complex, bidirectional shelf-deep ocean exchange, in response to strong forcing typical of mid-latitude western ocean margins. Shelf-deep ocean exchange processes at such dynamic sites remain poorly understood, due in part to the technical challenge of resolving broad ranges of relevant spatial and temporal scales. The understanding gained by investigating the wide seasonal range of parameter space will facilitate exploration of how shelf circulation and shelf-open ocean exchange may evolve due to observed and projected long-term shifts in regional and basin-scale circulation, hydrography, and atmospheric forcing. This project will deploy fixed, mobile, and remote observational platforms in combination with idealized and realistic numerical simulations to investigate exchange processes near Cape Hatteras. The sampling array will provide an observational data set with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution in a region of large episodic export and exchange. These observations will be used to identify dominant exchange processes; correlate them with observed forcing; define ranges of forcing and shelf response; verify parallel developments within the realistic model framework; and establish causation through detailed assessment of momentum and vorticity balances, integrating observational and validated model products. In addition to physical data, the autonomous gliders will also collect chlorophyll fluorescence, oxygen saturation, and acoustic backscatter data that are of direct relevance to biogeochemical properties exported from the shelf to the deep ocean. These non-physical data will be used as water mass tracers and to portray the structure of the chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen at unprecedented resolution."

The pace of technological change is rapidly increasing at the same time, such that the tools available and the challenges now being faced are not the same ones that will be present in only a few years. Thus, it is imperative that the education of engineers includes teaching them to use existing knowledge in new ways to tackle unexpected problems. This study investigates how students and engineers understand their own knowledge, so we will be better able to address students' existing knowledge models and help them develop into more agile, efficient engineers of the future.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to understand how students' personal epistemologies (i.e. their assumptions about what it means to know something, and what counts as knowledge) develop through their experiences in engineering education and practice.  As students learn, professors teach, and administrators work toward constant improvement, they are all operating from within their own personal epistemologies and making fundamental assumptions about how knowledge and certainty are generated, shared and re-formed.  In particular, they all make assumptions about the epistemology of engineering and what characterizes an engineering way of knowing.  Currently, epistemological assumptions about engineering practice are largely unspoken and unexamined. Current research suggests that many faculty members operate under different assumptions about knowledge, and that these differences limit their potential to develop or collaborate toward common goals.  This project will use interviews and thematic analysis to bring to light the personal epistemologies of engineering students and faculty, and help orient them to the epistemological demands of engineering practice.  It is essential that central stakeholders develop tools and resources to discuss their own and others' personal epistemologies to achieve the goals of engineering education, and to make sure that those goals remain oriented to achieving significant social good.  The practical goals of this project can be expressed as four specific aims:  (1) Characterize the personal epistemologies of engineering students and practicing engineers; (2) Critically analyze the implications of students' personal epistemologies in the contexts of engineering education and practice; (3) Iteratively develop, implement and assess materials and methods for epistemological learning in engineering content courses, and; (4) Develop broader understanding of personal epistemologies among engineering educators and engineering education researchers."

Identifying crop nematode infestation with a quick and reliable soil analysis technique is possibly the Holy Grail in plant nematology. In this context, an automated instrument to determine cyst nematode egg numbers will be truly appealing for farmers, plant scientists, and agribusinesses. Knowing the nature and level of cyst nematode infestation in a field will help the farmer monitor the effectiveness of and plan for better pest management strategies, thereby improving soybean productivity. The instrument technology will be disseminated through extension talks to Iowa farmers and agribusiness personnel, online newsletters, videos on educational websites, and demonstrations at scientific and farmer conferences. Outreach will be conducted to stakeholders in the seed industry and universities to convince them to test the new instrument and provide feedback. In addition, programs will be developed to train minority and female life science students in programming and engaging third grade Iowa students through a unique NSF STEM-C project called Trinect.<br/><br/>Plant-parasitic nematodes, such as the Soybean Cyst Nematode (SCN), are microscopic worms that damage plants and reduce crop yields worldwide. The only definite way to accurately identify SCN infestations and predict future crop damage in fields is by extracting and counting the number of SCN worms, cysts, and eggs in the soil. Current nematode extraction procedures and instruments are very old and labor intensive, and it is challenging to automate methods of soil processing and analysis. This project is to build a modern, automated instrument to perform all the mechanical functions involved in current nematode extraction procedures. Also, a smartphone-based microscope with custom software will be realized for the counting of SCN worms, cysts, and eggs. This automation will improve data consistency and reliability, reduce labor costs, and increase SCN testing of fields. The new instrument is designed to be flexible in operation for extracting different types of plant-parasitic nematodes, soil-borne fungal spores, and weed seeds."

These REU site programs are located at many different institutions across the county, and the scientists who run them are often the only faculty in their institution responsible for organizing this type of student research/professional development program. Although there is a general knowledge of how these programs should be managed, there has been limited sharing of ideas and best practices among the REU PIs. In the past, new PIs have had little support as they work through the details of developing and organizing a new REU program, and experienced PIs face a variety of challenges, including recruiting diverse students. <br/><br/>This award provides funding to support the REU programs through professional networking efforts: (1) to connect PIs and managers running REU Sites, (2) to document and improve best practices, (3) to provide a support system for dealing with challenges and developments, and (4) to foster an understanding of how to integrate diversity approaches in all programmatic elements. The Principal Investigators (PIs) will formalize this support of REU managers in the geosciences by publishing handbooks for REU PIs, mentors and interns, and by organizing opportunities for REU PIs and REU interns to meet and exchange information. Ongoing networking activities will include hosting telecons and webinars on REU management, student recruitment, etc. and hosting and monitoring the GEO REU listserve. The goal is to develop a community of REU leaders and to increase the efficacy of REUs programs, allowing REU PIs to create a higher quality research experience for undergraduates. In addition, REU PIs will receive support for recruiting students from diverse backgrounds in order to increase participation by students who are from under-represented groups and community colleges or who are first-generation college students. <br/><br/>Formalizing the networking activities and adding webinars, manuals, etc. will help the community run more effective programs and attract applications from a diverse set of students. The PI will provide support and leadership necessary to strengthen the REU programs that are funded by the Directorate of Geosciences. It will have a direct impact on the quality of research internship programs provided to more than 600 students each year. Improving the quality of these programs and the diversity of students who participate in them is likely to have an important impact on the future ocean sciences research community. The REU program is a major source of new graduate students since many of the students who participate in them go on to attend graduate school in STEM fields."

Summer sea ice is disappearing and the sea surface is warming and becoming less salty.  This changing physical environment is altering basic biological processes and air-sea exchange of gasses. The carbon cycle is of particular interest in the Arctic because it is unknown how carbon dioxide sources and sinks are changing and whether these changes will lead to increased greenhouse gas accumulation in the atmosphere.  It is thought that with less ice cover the Arctic Ocean will absorb more human-produced carbon dioxide. Higher carbon dioxide levels cause the ocean to become more acidic because carbon dioxide forms carbonic acid when it dissolves in water.  The increase in the acidity of the water can affect the food web by harming shell-forming organisms.  In spite of these important issues, not much is known about the carbon cycle in the central Arctic Ocean basins. Nearly all measurements of ocean acidity have been made on the Arctic shelves during the summer period when access is easy.  We will measure the amount of dissolved oxygen and carbon dioxide in the surface water and its acidity in the central Arctic Ocean during a summer cruise on the ice breaker Louis St. Laurent and on year-round oceanographic moorings. Outreach activities include continued operation of an ocean acidification exhibit that we developed for University of Montana?s science museum which has been seen by thousands of museum visitors.<br/><br/>The research will specifically support installment of a shipboard underway pCO2 system along with deployment of pCO2, pH, and photosynthetically active radiation sensors on the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution time-series moorings in the Beaufort Sea.  The ship follows the same cruise track since the program began in 2003, starting south on the Beaufort shelf and extending to the northern Canada Basin.  Three moorings are deployed annually with a subsurface profiler that measures conductivity, temperature, depth, and dissolved O2.  Our sensors are deployed at ~35 m depth, just below the subsurface float. These data will allow us to compute air-sea CO2 fluxes and net community productivity during periods when there is less than 100% ice cover and photosynthetically active radiation is greater than zero. The quality-controlled shipboard and mooring data will be made available to the scientific community by submission of the data to the Arctic data repository (ACADIS)."

This project will develop new modeling techniques for predicting such changes using ideas derived from physics in the subdiscipline of thermodynamics that concerns how energy moves in a system.  Recent advancements in the thermodynamics of systems that change over time indicate that systems will internally organize so as to maximize the flow and dissipation of energy.  For example, the temperature difference that develops between the ocean and atmosphere over the summer drives the formation of hurricanes (the organized structures) whose presence hastens the dissipation of the temperature difference.  This project utilizes this fundamental property but extends it to microbial communities, such as bacteria and phytoplankton, which form the base of the ocean food web and strongly influence ocean chemistry. Based on information on how biology utilizes solar and chemical energy to construct itself from carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and other elements in the environment, the model can predict how metabolic functions, such as photosynthesis or nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere, are expressed over time and space within the ocean.  These predictions can be compared to existing oceanographic observations, including newly developed techniques that rely on DNA and RNA sequencing to determine metabolic function of the microbial community.  This project will support one postdoctoral scholar in this new interface between ocean biogeochemistry modeling, thermodynamics and molecular observations.  The project will also support summer internships as part of the Woods Hole Partnership Education Program, a consortium of institutions committed to increasing student diversity in Woods Hole, as well as support two independent undergraduate research projects per year as part of the Semester in Environmental Science Program at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL).  A workshop will be held in year 2 of the project to broaden exposure of thermodynamic approaches in marine biogeochemistry and explore its place in the broader context of recent advances in metabolic modeling and theory.  Ocean model code developed during the project will be open source and publicly disseminated.<br/><br/>This project builds upon the Darwin Project, a trait and selection based modeling approach for describing marine plankton communities and biogeochemical cycles. The approach relies on local competition to select from a diverse population and determines the functional characteristics of microorganisms that mediate biogeochemical cycles.  The project will combine this selection-based modeling approach with a distributed metabolic network perspective previously developed to facilitate calculating reaction thermodynamics. This will provide mechanistic and quantitative description of key metabolic functions and allow the new model to be directly mappable to omics-based observations.  The project will utilize new modeling design criteria based on the maximum entropy production (MEP) conjecture to determine allocation of metabolic machinery and its expression, such as metabolic switching between nitrogen fixation and ammonium uptake. Model testing will rely on existing oceanographic surveys and observations. Once validated, the coupled model will be used to investigate losses of functional biodiversity, generalist versus specialists, temporal planktonic strategies as well as losses in community complementarity on ecosystem biogeochemistry. A significant output from the project will be a predicted global biogeography map of metabolic function and expression (such as nitrogen fixation and ammonium oxidation) that can be tested with, and used to interpret, directed omics observations."

This means less information is worked with and requires inputting. The connection between roots and nodes allows for novel features like Summary Analysis.  The team's current commercialization plan will start with targeting wet lab researchers. On the academic side, the team will start with Universities in the bay area (Stanford University, UC Berkeley,UCSF). In industry, the team will target small and medium size biomedical and pharmaceutical companies.

The aim of the REU Site is for undergraduate students to be introduced to research generally and solar research specifically, to experience how the course work they are studying can be put into practice to tackle the terawatt challenge, and to practice how the principles of scientific research can be applied to any engineering challenge.<br/><br/>This REU Site offers opportunities for undergraduate students to engage in solar research during a 9-week summer program, on topics that range from fundamental (e.g., new growth methods for the active layers in III-V multi-junction solar cells) to applied (e.g., degradation mechanisms in silicon modules in the field). Participants in the REU program will be immersed in this intellectual melting pot of ongoing solar research, both strengthening existing projects (e.g., high-mobility transparent conductive oxides) and being involved in the initiation of others (e.g., silicon-based tandem solar cells). The REU projects will be designed to cross traditional disciplinary boundaries-as photovoltaic research is apt to do-synergistically combining device physics, materials science, chemistry, electrical engineering, and sustainability. The REU students' laboratory experience will be enhanced by seminars and workshops that provide them with access to experts in a wide range of fields including PV research and development, the social science of energy usage, sustainability, and the solar energy industry.  The program will also include a number of social activities designed to encourage formal and informal communication skills, collaborative problem solving and teamwork with colleagues from diverse cultural, geographic, and demographic backgrounds. Each student will travel to one conference or workshop to present his or her work. The REU will recruit heavily from the network of QESST partner institutions, most of which have substantial populations of students that are under-represented in engineering. Through research that crosses disciplinary boundaries and a diverse base of mentors, this REU Site will retain students of all backgrounds in engineering as they pursue advanced degrees and careers."

It also suggests that some of the first detectable impacts of environmental change may lie in alterations in the ability of organisms to grow and reproduce, rather than just lethality.  This project will develop a framework for looking at the impacts of extreme environmental change on an ecologically and economically important bivalve species, the mussel Mytilus edulis, in the Gulf of Maine, which is warming at an unusually fast rate.  Importantly, our modeling framework is, for the first time, able to account for the interactions of temperature change with the additional stresses that occur in the presence of predators.  These models will therefore not only advance our basic understanding of how multiple stressors affect animals in nature, but also will provide a mechanism for predicting the impacts of environmental change under realistic field conditions that are often ignored by laboratory-only based experiments. The project also will create novel methods for teaching high school students about the impacts of extreme change on their local environments using cutting-edge virtual-reality technology coupled with hands-on experiential learning in the field.<br/><br/>This project seeks to develop a predictive energetics (Dynamic Energy Budget) approach to quantitatively explore the potentially interactive effects of abiotic (temperature) and biotic (risk of predation) stressors on intertidal mussels. The central question that addressed by this project is, how unreliable may predictions of the impacts of environmental change be if a focus is placed only on the isolated rather than combined influence of abiotic or biotic stressors? A framework that considers the effects of environmental change on multiple, interacting species is sorely needed. Building upon an energetics model already parameterized to quantify the effects of temperature and food availability on the mussel Mytilus edulis, this project expands the approach to examine how predation risk - the ""fear of being eaten"" - may alter thermal sensitivity under more realistic field conditions where predators are present. Previous work by this team has shown that the effects of predation risk are comparable to, or exceed those, caused by predicted climate scenarios, but very few attempts have been made to place these risk effects within a bioenergetics framework, especially in marine systems. This proposal capitalizes on the highly complementary approaches of two research groups to develop a predictive framework examining the cumulative effects of abiotic and biotic stressors on growth, maximum size and reproduction of an important ecosystem engineer under realistic field and trophic interaction conditions."

They are also especially vulnerable to human pressures and environmental change. Wetlands contain large reservoirs of soil organic matter, an important source of carbon and nitrogen to estuaries and coastal oceans, but very little is known about the processes involved in the translocation of these nutrients. This project will advance understanding of tidal marsh-estuarine interactions by linking processes between tidal wetland soils and estuaries, and assessing where, when, and how dissolved organic compounds are retained, released and transformed within the marsh soil-estuarine system. Results from this study will be integrated into enhanced monitoring and management efforts through partnerships with the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. The project will improve models that predict the influence of wetlands on estuarine and coastal biology,  geochemistry and pollution response.  In collaboration with the Smithsonian Citizen Science program and teachers from middle schools serving minority students, the team will develop K-12 educational materials.  Specialized training will be extended to undergraduate students, as well as graduate and postdoctoral researchers, with a particular focus on underrepresented groups in science. <br/><br/>This study will test three key research hypotheses that are critical for understanding the role of marsh soils and tidal wetland-estuary margins as buffers, reactors, and transformers of dissolved organic C and N, and that could transform our ability to predict the influence of wetland ecosystems on estuarine biology, biogeochemistry, and ecology. An integrative approach will be used to test hypotheses that combines rich datasets, process-focused experiments, and a novel coupled hydrodynamic-photo-biogeochemical model to investigate three understudied aspects of marsh export that likely control the seasonality and fate of dissolved organic matter in estuaries: (i) soil and porewater organic matter composition, (ii) adsorption-desorption on soil surfaces, and iii) photo- and bio- degradation in estuarine waters. Proposed activities incorporate a system perspective and cover a broad range of marsh environments (i.e., different marsh vegetation characteristics, soil type, surface area and salinity regimes) providing the ability to scale up and assess tidal marsh biogeochemical fluxes and processes across a range of spatial and temporal scales.  Results from this research will increase understanding of the contributions of wetlands and estuarine systems to coastal carbon and nitrogen budgets, and improve predictions of the influences of natural and man-made stresses on ecosystem processes, biogeochemical cycles and exchanges along the continuum of wetlands, estuaries and the coastal zone. This information is highly valuable to managing the coastal zone in the face of accelerated environmental change and continued human pressures and, in particular, to evaluating the potential for managed restoration of wetlands to mitigate climate change impacts."

This project will develop new modeling techniques for predicting such changes using ideas derived from physics in the subdiscipline of thermodynamics that concerns how energy moves in a system.  Recent advancements in the thermodynamics of systems that change over time indicate that systems will internally organize so as to maximize the flow and dissipation of energy.  For example, the temperature difference that develops between the ocean and atmosphere over the summer drives the formation of hurricanes (the organized structures) whose presence hastens the dissipation of the temperature difference.  This project utilizes this fundamental property but extends it to microbial communities, such as bacteria and phytoplankton, which form the base of the ocean food web and strongly influence ocean chemistry. Based on information on how biology utilizes solar and chemical energy to construct itself from carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus and other elements in the environment, the model can predict how metabolic functions, such as photosynthesis or nitrogen fixation from the atmosphere, are expressed over time and space within the ocean.  These predictions can be compared to existing oceanographic observations, including newly developed techniques that rely on DNA and RNA sequencing to determine metabolic function of the microbial community.  This project will support one postdoctoral scholar in this new interface between ocean biogeochemistry modeling, thermodynamics and molecular observations.  The project will also support summer internships as part of the Woods Hole Partnership Education Program, a consortium of institutions committed to increasing student diversity in Woods Hole, as well as support two independent undergraduate research projects per year as part of the Semester in Environmental Science Program at the Marine Biological Laboratory (MBL).  A workshop will be held in year 2 of the project to broaden exposure of thermodynamic approaches in marine biogeochemistry and explore its place in the broader context of recent advances in metabolic modeling and theory.  Ocean model code developed during the project will be open source and publicly disseminated.<br/><br/>This project builds upon the Darwin Project, a trait and selection based modeling approach for describing marine plankton communities and biogeochemical cycles. The approach relies on local competition to select from a diverse population and determines the functional characteristics of microorganisms that mediate biogeochemical cycles.  The project will combine this selection-based modeling approach with a distributed metabolic network perspective previously developed to facilitate calculating reaction thermodynamics. This will provide mechanistic and quantitative description of key metabolic functions and allow the new model to be directly mappable to omics-based observations.  The project will utilize new modeling design criteria based on the maximum entropy production (MEP) conjecture to determine allocation of metabolic machinery and its expression, such as metabolic switching between nitrogen fixation and ammonium uptake. Model testing will rely on existing oceanographic surveys and observations. Once validated, the coupled model will be used to investigate losses of functional biodiversity, generalist versus specialists, temporal planktonic strategies as well as losses in community complementarity on ecosystem biogeochemistry. A significant output from the project will be a predicted global biogeography map of metabolic function and expression (such as nitrogen fixation and ammonium oxidation) that can be tested with, and used to interpret, directed omics observations."

Nitrogen is extremely abundant in the atmosphere in the inert form of gaseous N2, but most organisms cannot reduce N2 into a biologically available form. In all environments, including agricultural soils, there are microorganisms that can make available the N from gaseous N2 by reducing it to the biologically available form, ammonium. In the vast expanses of the open ocean, few organisms are known to have this ability, and recently a unique symbiosis between a single-celled cyanobacterium and a single-celled algae was discovered, which appears to be very widely distributed and likely of global biogeochemical significance. The cyanobacterium in this symbiotic partnership has very unusual metabolism and genomic streamlining. Little is known of the symbiosis because it is not detectable except by modern molecular biological techniques. Recent work has shown this symbiosis to be very widely spread through the oceans, and that there is previously unrecognized diversity in both the cyanobacterial and algal hosts. This research will examine the environmental distributions and the biogeochemical significance of this diversity in coastal US waters. The investigators will engage the public in ocean sciences through internship programs at local high schools and for undergraduate students at Stanford, and by documenting their field research in a 'virtual cruise' blog.<br/><br/>In the marine environment, the contribution of N2 fixation to the fixed nitrogen (N) pool is poorly quantified, in part due to an incomplete understanding on the abundance, activity, and physiology of diazotrophs. The symbiotic unicellular cyanobacteria (UCYN-A) is a poorly characterized, yet globally important, group of marine diazotrophs. UCYN-A is widely distributed in the marine environment, and lives symbiotically with a picoeukaryotic prymnesiophyte alga. We now know that there are multiple ecotypes of UCYN-A, which may be adapted to specific locations in the water-column and different oceanic provinces. Typically N2 fixation was considered unimportant in coastally influenced and non-tropical waters, however recent data shows that multiple subclades of UCYN-A are present. The distribution and rate of N2 fixation by UCYN-A subclades in coastal/nearshore environments is a major unknown in the oceanic N cycle. Its presence in nearshore waters may change the paradigm of the balance between basin N sources (N2 fixation) and sinks (denitrification).  Likewise, significant N2 fixation by UCYN-A will need to be considered when determining estimates of new production in coastally influenced waters. This project aims to quantify the significance of different UCYN-A subclades to coastal/nearshore N budgets. It tackles the issue of determining N2 fixation rates by different UCYN-A subclades in coastal waters through rigorous fieldwork off the west coast of North America. The temporal and spatial distribution of UCYN-A subclades, as well as the rates of N2 fixation, will be determined by coupling N2 fixation measurements of bulk communities and individual cells (nanoSIMS) with molecular assays to study these widespread, but dilute, diazotrophic symbionts and their hosts. Additionally the investigators will conduct experiments aimed at constraining the effects of light and nutrient ratios (N/P) on UCYN-A N2 fixation rates, and the prymnesiophyte host's rate of carbon fixation. They will conduct this work through seasonal sampling of a coastal site in the Southern California Bight (Scripps Pier) and on two process cruises in the coastal waters between central California and the Baja Peninsula.  The cruise work will provide an opportunity to understand the temporal dynamics of the UCYN-A/prymnesiophyte associations over larger spatial scales. Finally, evidence suggests that unidentified UCYN-A subclades and hosts exist and the investigators have developed a strategy to identify and quantify their temporal and spatial distributions as well as their N2 fixation activities. Data on the coastal distribution, ecology and activity of UCYN-A is critical for obtaining a better understanding of their contribution to fixed N to the marine environment. The group-specific and bulk rates of N2 fixation measured in this study of coastally influenced waters, will provide data for future modeling efforts, which will make an important contribution to constraining oceanic N2 fixation inputs."

Brittle behavior and friction laws that describe slip over fractured or rough fault surfaces do not account for the fact that fault zones can simultaneously break in a brittle manner and flow in a ductile way as has been observed in the geologic record. This project combines laboratory experiments and theoretical analysis on the effect a semi-brittle material can have on the mechanisms of deformation localization and slip accumulation, which may provide critical insights on the mechanics of earthquakes.<br/><br/>This project proposes that the wide variation in deformation speeds from earthquake to steady creep can be explained by the interaction of brittle fracturing and ductile flow in a semi-brittle material.  This behavior will be explored with physical experiments using Carbopol, which exhibits both brittle and ductile deformation simultaneously. The experiments will test whether the interaction of tensional and shear fractures in a semi-brittle material leads to strain transients, or if, alternatively, the re-occurring strain transients are controlled by the strength along the shear fracture such that the formation of the fractures only appears to be concurrent with the slip.  The results will be incorporated into an analytical model, which allows extrapolating the results to time scales relevant to strain transients in Earth. The work proposed here will fundamentally advance the understanding of semi-brittle deformation and its impact on strain transients.<br/>"

A researcher from Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution plans to develop a numerical model of ocean circulation, sediment transport, and particle scavenging to determine the processes that control the distribution of these two radionuclides in the Western North Atlantic.  This study is particularly timely, since model observations will be tested using data collected as part of the ongoing GEOTRACES program.

The model will be used to constrain the processes that control oceanic distributions of Th-230 and Pa-231, two radionuclides the ratios of which have been extensively used in studying past ocean circulation. The model will be compared to GEOTRACES data for comparison and to help refine the model, placing the project in line with two of the overriding goals of the GEOTRACES program.

Currently accounting for over 50% of the nation's undergraduate population, community colleges are a crucial pipeline to the geosciences workforce. However, several barriers impact the recruitment, retention, and graduation of community college geosciences majors, including the diverse nature of students with respect to academic preparedness, economic standing, sense of support and awareness of career opportunities - making recruitment and persistence challenging for two-year geoscience programs.  To meet the employment demand, an increased number of students must enroll, persist and graduate from two-year geosciences programs.

This GEOPATH: EXTRA project will build on ongoing STEM collaborations established through SCCC's highly successful, state-funded Science & Technology Entry and Liberty Partnerships programs, and its NSF S-STEM Scholars Program, by bringing together three regional high schools, Stony Brook University's Department of Geosciences and its School of Marine and Atmospheric Science, the National Oceanic & Atmospheric Administration, the U.S. Geological Survey - Water Resources Division and private industry partners to provide a pathways from high school to college and into the geoscience workforce. The goals of the GEO CORE project are to: 1) increase enrollment within the geosciences, particularly for students underrepresented in the disciplines; 2) enhance student learning experiences and outcomes; and 3) increase transfer rates and job placements to support regional workforce needs. Through the GEO CORE program, SCCC is instituting the following collaborative activities: 1) implementation of a summer institute for graduating high school and first-year community college students led by geoscience professionals and academics that incorporates research-oriented fieldwork experiences that highlight the interconnection between the geosciences and the regional environmental and economic concerns;  2) creating a GEO CORE Student Ambassador Program which prepares and supports second-year geoscience students who serve as peer mentors and academic tutors to foster success among first-year students; 3) establishing a career-based training program that includes hazardous materials training and certification to ensure that graduating geoscience students have the skills necessary for immediate employment and/or success upon transfer to four-year colleges and universities; 4) forming a community of practice for professional and peer networking opportunities among government agencies, industry, higher education institutions and high schools; and 5) encouraging the integration of GEO CORE activities into high school classrooms to serve as a bridge between secondary schools and the community college to help grow the geoscience education pipeline. Project success is being measured by comparing student outcomes to established baselines, and tracking the academic success, graduation, transfer, research experiences and career advancement of each annual cohort served by GEO CORE."

The chemical and physical processes that tidal marsh sediments undergo determine the nature of the transformation and accumulation of particulate organic carbon (POC) at the marine to terrestrial interface. Physical transport of pore water through marsh sediments greatly influences the availability of carbon and nutrients that can undergo transformative reactions at the marine to terrestrial interface. Past studies have shown that there is a discrepancy between predicted rates of pore water flow and calculated estimates from tracer studies. Because this flow is crucial to the chemistry of sediment at the terrestrial to marine interface, which is the first junction of the chemical species exported to the ocean, it is important to explain the discrepancy between expected rates of flow and observed rates. This study will use a known tracer method based on natural isotopic ratios (224Radon/228Thorium) and will develop a new method (223Radon/ 227Actinium) to evaluate the export of POC due to pore water flow in tidal marsh sediments, which will have much broader impacts to the overall marine carbon budget. Results from this work will also be integrated into workshops that will educate students and teachers from outside of oceanography about oceanographic carbon and climate research.  Presentations will also be developed in collaboration with the South Carolina State Museum as part of the Science Café series. Additionally, one graduate student and one undergraduate student will be supported by this funding.<br/><br/>Predicted advection rates of pore water in very fine-grained tidal marsh sediments have been shown to significantly differ from rates calculated using tracer studies. Because tidal marshes are a crucial chemical link at the marine terrestrial interface, and advection has a significant impact on the availability of chemical species to undergo diagenetic reactions at this interface, it is of significant importance to evaluate this discrepancy. Export of particulate organic carbon (POC) and dissolved organic carbon (DIC), in particular, are of interest, due to the impact on microbial communities within sediments. This research aims to validate the method of 224Ra/228Th disequilibrium to calculate pore water exchange rates. Previous studies using this method have provided evidence for more rapid pore water exchange than would generally be expected in such fine-grained sediments, which are less permeable than coarser grained sediment. Additionally, this research will attempt to develop the disequilibrium method for 223Ra/227Ac. The researchers will evaluate the impact of advection rates on the export of chemical species in salt marshes."

Improving the forecasts of blocking events and assessing how the frequency, severity, and location of such events may change with climate change are of substantial societal importance. Synoptic eddies have been shown to play a critical role in the dynamics of atmospheric blocking events by maintaining the blocking pattern but the understanding of their role is currently not sufficiently complete and quantitative. <br/><br/>The goals of the proposed research are 1) to improve the dynamical understanding of atmospheric blocking events through developing a quantitative assessment of synoptic-eddy forcing of blocks. 2) to employ this dynamical understanding to investigate how blocking events will change with climate change and how blocks can be better simulated in climate and weather models. The proposed research will employ numerical experiments with a hierarchy of general circulation models, reanalysis data, and archived results of full-physics general circulation models such as Coupled Model Intercomparison Project models. The research has three components: the first is to study the eddy-forcing mechanism using idealized modeling experiments which to isolate and develop a quantitative understanding of this mechanism. The same idealized framework will be used to investigate how the speed and latitude of jet streams, different patterns of quasi-stationary planetary waves, and moisture modulate this mechanism. The second component is to test this understanding using the reanalysis data and to gain further insight into the dynamic of observed blocking events. The third component is to apply this understanding to examine the performance of full-physics models in simulating blocking, and to provide a more reliable and conclusive prediction on how blocking events will change in the future."

Recent genetic evidence suggesting that our hominin ancestors interbred with other hominin species has highlighted hybridization in our own evolutionary past. If there are predictable patterns in hybrid skeletal shape, it might be possible to identify evidence of hybrids in the hominin fossil record, for which genetic data are not always recoverable. A good way to determine whether such patterns exist is to study hybrid skeletal shape in species that are closely related to humans. This project will preserve hybrid macaque (monkey) skeletons and related imaging, genetic, and life history data that would provide excellent comparative data on hybridization, but that are at immediate risk of being lost. The monkeys are part of a hybrid macaque colony (Chinese and Indian Macaca mulatta) that is no longer being expanded and is therefore declining in size as individual animals die. If the monkeys' skeletal data are not preserved after death, and normally they are not, this valuable resource to understand hybridization will be lost. This study will benefit the scientific community by producing a curated research collection of hybrid skeletal remains and associated data.  It will also support international collaborations and student mentorship and training.  <br/><br/>Recent evidence of gene flow among archaic human lineages has brought admixture to the forefront of anthropological and public interest. This study will develop principled criteria for detecting skeletal evidence of admixture, using a model organism that is closely related to humans. Specifically, the RAPID award will allow for postmortem preservation and scanning of approximately 80 macaque hybrids from the California National Primate Research Center (CNPRC), starting immediately, so that their skeletons and related data can become part of a valuable collection used to address hybridization and other research topics. Attrition in the hybrid macaque colony is high, and a representative sample of the colony (in terms of hybrid status) may not be possible to acquire if individual animals are not preserved starting now. The investigators plan to use the resulting skeletal collection (estimated n=200) to quantify and model hybrid phenotypic variation, evaluate discriminant functions to distinguish hybrids from non-hybrids, and develop models for detecting hybridization in hominins and other taxa on the basis of skeletal phenotype. Large, genotyped primate samples of known pedigree are very rare. The skeletal sample and associated data will be curated at UC Davis and made available to other researchers. The collection and related research questions are likely to be of interest in disciplines including primatology, biology, zoology, and quantitative genetics."

Subduction zones are where two tectonic plates collide and one sinks below the other.  Subduction zones produce the largest earthquakes in the world, such as the magnitude 9.0 Tohoku earthquake of 2011 that caused widespread destruction in northern Japan.  This project will focus on two subduction zone regions: Cascadia in the U.S. and Hikurangi in New Zealand. Onshore and offshore GPS data will be modeled to determine the amount of slip released as slow slip events, as steady creep, or where regions are locked and not slipping. Slow slip events refer to slip on a fault that is similar to what occurs during an earthquake, but occurs much more slowly and does not emit damaging seismic waves. Locked regions refer to areas of a fault in which friction prevents slip, allowing energy to build up for future release in an earthquake. In contrast to previous modeling work, this project will use realistic, three-dimensional elastic properties of the earth constrained by prior seismic studies. The products of this project will directly inform earthquake hazard forecasts for both the Cascadia and Hikurangi subduction zones, which have major cities nearby (Portland and Seattle in Cascadia; Wellington in Hikurangi). Important additional information will be obtained for an International Ocean Discovery Program project scheduled for the northern Hikurangi margin in 2018 that is targeting the slow slip region. The project will support and train an early career female scientist who will be mentored by a more established female scientist.  The project also features public outreach through public talks in New Zealand and the U.S. and the incorporation of the results into lecture materials at two universities in the U.S.<br/><br/>This project will generate new and improved catalogs of slow slip events and plate locking models for the Cascadia and Hikurangi (New Zealand) subduction zones. A Network Inversion Filter (NIF) technique will be used to process all available GPS data to identify slow slip events, and produce models of slip and slip-rate evolution over time.  The NIF technique is based on a Kalman filter approach, which balances a physically reasonable but inaccurate model of steady slip with noisy data.  Additionally, these NIF inversions will incorporate offshore ocean bottom pressure (OBP) data from the Hikurangi Ocean Bottom Investigation of Tremor and Slow Slip deployment during the mid-2014 to mid-2015 time period for the Hikurangi subduction zone.  These OBP instruments recorded a large offshore slow slip event in late 2014. These models include, for the first time, realistic, three-dimensional earth structure and the effects topography and bathymetry.  Long-term velocities of GPS stations will be modeled to obtain improved constraints on the plate interface locking region for each subduction zone. Plate locking indicates how much of the expected motion between tectonic plates is not occurring continuously at the boundary, and could therefore be released in earthquakes or slow slip events. GPS station velocities will be averaged in two ways: first only over times between slow slip events and second by averaging through slow slip events which will provide two locking models for each subduction zone.  Products will include new realistic 3D locking models for the two regions, slow-slip event catalogs for both subduction zones and a full-slip budget with uncertainties for each subduction zone as a function of location over the time period of study."

It can also enable researchers to explore new material compositions leading to customized novel properties. To ensure quality of components in laser melting (one of the additive manufacturing processes) and reduce the lead time, it is critical to be able to evaluate material microstructure changes in response to the dynamic high thermal gradient in the process, and the strength of constructed materials under static and dynamic loads after the process. This award supports fundamental research to enable modeling and simulation methods that allow for realistic predictions, process design and optimization, and equipment design of laser melting additive process. The obtained knowledge provides the foundation for researchers and manufacturers to engineer new materials in small lot size at low cost by using laser melting additive process. It can also contribute to understanding the behavior of a broad range of materials in laser melting. Research results will enhance current engineering courses, and provide cross-disciplinary training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>The research objectives are to: (1) acquire knowledge on the mechanism of non-equilibrium solidification in laser melting, (2) determine the effects of non-uniform cyclic thermal history due to multilayer construction on microstructure changes, and (3) establish the relationship between the microstructure resulted from laser melting and the material performances. To achieve the first objective, a thermo-mechanical finite element analysis will be constructed to simulate the material addition process of laser melting, a phase-field approach will be created to calculate the time-dependent growth of alloy phase field based on the computed thermal history, and single-pass and multilayer laser melting experiments will be conducted on a medium carbon steel. The correlation between high thermal gradients from computation and the solute trapping phenomenon from experimental observation will be made to reveal the non-equilibrium solidification mechanism. To achieve the second objective, the microstructure evolutions under both single pass and multilayer laser melting processes are compared using the phase field approach, and verified by experiments. Microstructure variations in terms of grain size, phase composition and distribution will be obtained, resulting from different thermal histories of material points. To achieve the third objective, the analytical models for estimating strengths will be established based on the obtained material microstructure, and the fatigue crack initiation life will be estimated based on the minimum energy principle applied when a crack is created along the weakest material point and path."

During the course of 2016 the researcher will travel to several regions of Alaska to engage with indigenous scholars and educational and political leaders for an envisioned research project.   Such a project would by necessity be a collaborative effort between indigenous and non-indigenous community members, leaders, academics, and scholars.  The EAGER project is an essential first step in the Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) process that this project represents. <br/><br/>The focus of the research is to gain a long-term historical and comparative perspective on how rural Alaska Native people are coping with and responding to rapid changes in their lives and livelihoods.  As such this research focuses on shifts in subsistence practices and out-migration that can be traced across the past half century. Yet, these processes have accelerated over the past decade. The need for this research is pronounced. Understanding how individuals, kin and communities are thinking about and responding to these challenges from generational and comparative points of view has critical implications not only for rural indigenous peoples in Alaska but to many rural communities across the Circumpolar North as well as in aboriginal communities in Australia where similar processes are underway.  <br/><br/>Crucial to the success of the full research project, however, is the need to engage with leaders in Native Regional Corporations, Village Corporations, Tribal leaders, indigenous scholars, Native organizations locally, regionally and statewide, as well as educational administrators at the University of Alaska system and Mt. Edgecumbe High School.  One of the key elements of the project would be the inclusion of  Mt. Edgecumbe high school students as part of the research team.  Preliminary discussions with Mt. Edgecumbe administrators and pedagogues have been have been encouraging.  However, a community based participatory project necessitates that the PI travel statewide to have face-to-face meetings to discuss the potential design, benefits and merits of the larger. Moreover, the PI will have the opportunity to listen and learn from Native peoples underscoring the collaborative possibilities of a future social science research project. <br/><br/>Importantly this study will contribute to an understanding of the kinds of issues Alaska Native peoples are facing, the effects on kin and the panoply of coping strategies that are utilized by communities.  In addition to the academic articles the data produced by this project will be disseminated, orally and written, widely by the entire research team: to local communities involved in the research to tribal organizations, as well as at statewide and international conferences. Several additional methods will be utilized including digital storytelling and web-based platforms in sharing research results. This project is innovative methodologically in that underrepresented groups are embedded throughout the entire research project; Alaska Native high school students will be integral members of the research team alongside an Advisory Council made up of Alaska Native elders and young adults.  Moreover, the Alaska Native students involved in the project will gain invaluable hands on training in a range of social science methodologies. A graduate research assistant at the University of Alaska will be trained in research methods and the history and anthropology of the Circumpolar North.<br/><br/>Over the past half-century Alaska Native populations have experienced major socio-economic, political and cultural challenges. Changes in their political and economic circumstances, environmental shifts as well as substantial demographic flux, especially over the past two decades, have reworked the lives and livelihoods of many in rural communities. These transformations, however, are not experienced by everyone, everywhere in the same way, but rather are differentiated by geography, generation, gender and class (Krupnik and Vakhtin 1997, Berger 1984, Martin 2009, Taylor 2011). Using ethnographic fieldwork, key informant interviews, and oral histories the larger study will examine - through an intergenerational dialogue between elders and youth - how a range of kin, community and cultural practices may be utilized to make sense of, give meaning to and cope with significant upheavals in their lives. These transformations are perhaps most visible in declining participation in subsistence production (Callaway 1994; McNeeley 2012; Dinero 2013) and outmigration by young adults. The research will be comparative in that it not only explores these key issues across generations of rural indigenous peoples through notions of history and culture, but also garners perspectives across some of the major ethnic and ecological zones in Alaska. Moreover, this project is innovative methodologically in that eight Alaska Native high school students (to be selected and subsequently trained in anthropological methods) will be integral members of the research team at all key stages throughout the project; from design to data collection and analysis to data dissemination. The students will assume dual roles not only as researchers but also as interlocutors. As such their participation has the potential to push the boundaries between insider/outsider roles by interrogating the tensions between intellectual and cultural authority (Mallon 2012).<br/><br/>Over the last decade Arctic social science researchers, through the Arctic Social Science Program, have contributed much to the development of CBPR theories and methods.  By promoting the inclusion of Arctic community members in scientific research projects from design, to data collection, to analyses, to publication, the Arctic social science community has not only strengthened their research but also made it more relevant to these communities.   This proposal would build on these efforts and expand the CBPR model across generations in the Arctic.  The proposed research project would include intergenerational participation as a new component of the CBPR model developing in the Arctic.  Through this award, the PI will engage local indigenous and non-indigenous leaders, educators, and scholars in the project prior to writing and submitting a large research proposal; without their input the anticipated larger project would not be consistent with a CBPR model of research."

However, a wide range of evidence now demonstrates that this theory is not able to explain how many people make certain specific kinds of decisions -- for example, the highest price someone is willing to pay for an object is often lower than the lowest price he or she is willing to accept to go without the same object. This award will fund the PI's continued efforts to develop alternative models of behavior based on the idea that individuals may not be able to compare all options; in other words, people have incomplete preferences. The PI plans to consider whether and how this theory can account for a range of document decision making behaviors. He also plans to conduct decision making experiments in a lab environment to test hypotheses drawn from the theory. The results will advance our scientific understanding of this kind of human decision-making, and could be useful to businesses and governments that need to predict how individuals will respond to new products and policies.<br/><br/>The research will focus on developing a model in which subjects' preferences may be incomplete, and using that model to analyze several specific biases in decision making: the gap between willingness to accept and willingness to pay, certainty effects, decision in stochastic environments, and intertemporal choice. The goal is to provide axiomatic characterizations of models in which subjects chose to randomize, including a special case where the desire to randomize comes from the agents' uncertainty about her own utility of consumption. The project will also include work on preferences on lotteries over consumption streams and will introduce an axiom that captures aversion to variability of consumption over time."

This award supports fundamental research that aims to control the microstructure (size, shape and distribution of small-scale crystallites) of metallic alloy coatings. Since the mechanical, chemical and thermal properties are intimately connected to the microstructure, this would allow the PIs to tune the properties of the coatings for various applications.

This project aims to develop a new bottom-up process to synthesize intermetallic coatings with tailored microstructures using physical vapor deposition. The central hypothesis of the project is that by methodically seeding nanocrystals during the growth process, amorphous intermetallic coatings can be controllably crystallized during subsequent annealing at the appropriate temperature. The project will elucidate the fundamental physics of this process and demonstrate its practical viability by synthesizing and characterizing nanostructured titanium aluminide (TiAl) coatings with controlled grain size, aspect ratio and spatial distribution.

Decades of linguistic research have investigated how languages can change as a result of this language contact. The research shows that both the linguistic details of the languages in contact and the social circumstances in which that interaction takes place, can effect what changes and what does not, but more precise details still remain to be established. One hypothesis is that more extensive change in a language's grammar can happen in situations of contact between languages that are very similar, for example languages that descend from a common ancestor, as is the case for Spanish, Italian and French, all of which share a common ancestor language, Latin. How this increased susceptibility to change in contact interacts with changes in society is crucial for understanding the ways in which multilingual interactions are changing language today. Such investigation,however, requires a long-term perspective, one that considers centuries of changing social relations and shifting linguistic forms. The Mayan language Ixil provides a useful case study for the investigation of language contact between similar languages in shifting social circumstances.<br/><br/>Ixil is spoken today in vibrant rural communities in highland Guatemala, as well as in immigrant communities in Virginia and elsewhere in the United States. Speakers of Ixil have been in contact with speakers of several related languages, particularly K'iche',Q'anjob'al, and the Lowland Mayan (Yukatekan and Ch'olan) languages. These languages are similar to Ixil to different degrees, and have had contact with Ixil at different points in time in distinct social contexts, providing a range of test cases to trace the relationship between linguistic form and social relations. Hieroglyphic writing and colonial manuscripts provide linguistic data for languages involved in these linguistic exchanges spanning more than two thousand years. This project will complement those available resources by gathering an extensive corpus of Ixil linguistic material. It will use those data to identify and contextualize Ixil linguistic innovations resulting from contact with Lowland (Yukatekan and Ch'olan) Mayan languages over more than a thousand years. The type and degree of Lowland Mayan linguistic influence on Ixil will provide insights into the nature of the historical interaction between Lowland and Highland languages prior to the Spanish Conquest. It will also provide a rich case study of the interplay between structural similarity and socio-historical factors in conditioning the outcomes of language contact. Another focus of the project is to involve students in cutting-edge linguistic research and to engage with the communities that speak Ixil today, aiding efforts to revitalize the language and to communicate the history of Ixil to the people most directly connected to that history."

In the past decades, we have witnessed significant advances in nanomanufacturing capabilities. Different pre-designed patterns down to nanometer scale can be fabricated using various top-down and bottom-up methods. However, it is still a great challenge to manufacture nanostructures with sub-10 nanometer features over large areas using conventional fabrication techniques. Such small-scale structures are needed for the development of new applications. Using nano-scale antenna structures, localized optical field enhancements or 'hot-spots' are possible. Smaller gaps between the metallic nanopatterns will result in stronger 'hot spots'. Therefore, an affordable manufacturing method for large-area nanopatterning with sub-10 nanometer features is highly desirable. This award will employ the atomic layer deposition process to develop an inexpensive nanomanufacturing method to fabricate surface nanopatterns with accurately controlled gaps that can efficiently concentrate light field down to sub-10 nanometer scales over large areas. This interdisciplinary effort will link nanomanufacturing, computational electromagnetics, optoelectronics and optical sensing, and will provide a great opportunity for students to develop skills, values, and broad perspectives necessary for success in the global marketplace and for leadership in complex, multidisciplinary projects.<br/><br/>Building on recent successes in light management using nanostructures, this award will explore the potential to use this new nanomanufacturing method to fabricate super absorbing metamaterial surface structures or metasurfaces with controllable, ultra-narrow (sub-10nm) gaps. Specifically, this award will explore affordable fabrication processes to produce metallic nanopatterns with controllable separation distances defined by atomic layer deposited (ALD) dielectric films with the thickness accuracy of ~0.1nm. Such a capability will result in revolutionary advances in light-matter interactions at extremely deep subwavelength scales. Combined with pre-designed metamaterial cavity structures, incident light can be trapped within the nanogaps efficiently, resulting in a strongly enhanced localized field. By controlling the geometric parameters of nanopatterns, especially the gap dimension, the ultimate limit for plasmonic enhancement may be approached and be characterized conveniently over large areas. In this project, ALD-defined films will be combined with periodic and random nanopatterns to manufacture large area super absorbing metasurfaces, which will enable the development of novel on-chip energy collection, conversion and biosensing applications."

The HAAs analyzer will allow superintendents to continuously map, monitor and then optimize their drinking water treatment practices using detailed and high quality measurements on the federally-regulated HAAs, which are carcinogens. Optimizing of the water treatment practices using the HAAs analyzer will reduce chemical usage (save money) while simultaneously providing the highest quality drinking water for their customers by minimizing HAAs. The commercial U.S. market for Drinking Water chemicals, contract operations, consulting/engineering, instrument and testing is $19.3 billion. The entire U.S. Water industry market is $86.4 billion. The major target of this proposal is the 28,643 traditional community water systems serving 90 % of the U.S. population. Some water systems struggled to meet Stage 1 Disinfection By-Product (DBP) regulations. Stage 2 of these regulations is stricter. The DBP regulations address long-term (decades' timescale) exposure to HAAs. Superintendents can use the proposed HAAs analyzer to understand hourly, short-term variations in their treatment plants to enhance long-term minimization of HAAs.<br/><br/><br/><br/>This project will commercialize the first state-of-the-art instrument for fully automated, on-site process monitoring of the drinking water disinfection by-products known as haloacetic acids (HAAs). The HAAs analyzer proposed here has the potential to significantly reduce the cost of water treatment through reduction of treatment chemical usage at the water treatment plant while simultaneously improving and stabilizing water quality with respect to the carcinogenic and federally regulated HAAs. Currently, most drinking water treatment plants use contract laboratories to determine HAAs concentrations in the distribution system. This approaches can take 2 - 3 weeks to return the results at a significant expense for the equivalent hourly data provided by the proposed HAAs analyzer. The research objectives for this Phase II SBIR proposal are to develop components for the HAAs analyzer to enable long-term, maintenance free operation with minimal operator intervention. Simultaneously, costs will be reduced for both construction and operation of the HAAs analyzer to establish commercial feasibility. The anticipated results will be a HAAs analyzer that will provide water treatment personnel individual and Total HAAs concentrations once per hour, on-site and automatically."

The underlying reason is that molecules in the cell bounce around and collide with each other, and sometimes randomly react. This process is unpredictable in much the same way that the outcome is unpredictable when throwing dice. Cells can therefore differ greatly in their behavior, which is a main reason that they respond so differently to drugs and that sub-populations often survive e.g. cancer or antibiotic treatments. Recent technological developments now make it possible to measure the levels of components in individual cells, rather than just the average level over a population of cells. This provides an incredible amount of information, but also forces the data analyses to deal with many more complications when trying to interpret the data. This project will develop methods to analyze such data. Specifically, rather than basing the interpretations on greatly simplified assumptions, which may or may not be valid, it will develop tools to interpret data in terms of biological mechanisms while remaining agnostic about all the processes that indirectly affect the system dynamics. In previous treatments those indirect effects would completely confound interpretations, whereas the approaches in this project eliminate such problems entirely. The approach is broadly applicable and the project has broad consequences in basic cell and molecular biology, in health and medicine, and in ecology and population biology. Further, the project will train students at the interface between scientific disciplines, and generate principles and approaches that will be useful in undergraduate education.  <br/><br/>Single cell data for fluctuations in abundances contain a great deal of information about the underlying mechanisms. Conventional approaches to analyze such data have relied on fits to specific models that try to make correct assumptions about all processes that substantially affect the observed fluctuations. Whether using simple toy models or detailed simulations, this poses a great problem because so many indirect effects are not yet known that can greatly affect the process of interest. It has also been shown that model uniqueness is a great problem in this field, where very different feasible models produce the same fit, yet produce very different concrete conclusions about the underlying biology. In fact it has been exceedingly difficult to mechanistically interpret the simplest single cell processes in the simplest organisms, suggesting that there is little hope of interpreting more complex systems, such as human cells embedded in tissue. Research through this project addresses this challenge by considering large classes of processes collectively, allowing the models to differ arbitrarily in all indirect effects. This is possible by considering properties of marginal distributions that are provably unaffected by many model assumptions, and makes it possible to rigorously dissect complex and sparsely characterized networks subject to changing environmental inputs, nonlinear feedback loops and unknown sources of fluctuations, despite only having access to snapshots rather than time-series. Because the presented approaches are analytical, and the marginal properties can be intuitively expressed in terms of the few explicit mechanistic assumptions, the approach is also conceptually transparent. Further, because the testable relations produced by the theory are rigorously invariant of indirect effects, they are particularly well suited for the analysis of sparsely characterized complex systems or the effects of drugs, separating direct from indirect effects even when the latter are complicated and dominant."

In plants, the extracellular matrix is termed the cell wall, and is partially composed of the carbohydrates cellulose and pectin.  Several cell surface proteins act as sensors or receptors for the state of the cell wall, monitoring its integrity and composition.  The Wall Associated Kinases (WAKs) are cell surface receptors that bind to the pectin in the cell wall, and regulate cell enlargement. WAKs are also activated by fragmented pectins generated by pathogens, mechanical stress and perhaps by normal developmental changes. The experiments that will be conducted during this project will begin to help in understanding the mechanism by which WAKs can distinguish and respond to different types of pectin in the cell wall, and thereby how plants sense the state of their cell wall, essential for their growth and development. This work will be carried out at a small liberal arts college where the focus is on undergraduate education and research. Students receive a thorough training in experimental science through work in this project, and a significant portion go on to graduate and professional school.  The PI also incorporates many aspects of plant cell biology and genetics from his lab into the core cell biology and genetics lab course at the scientist's institution, and is involved in courses for underprepared students in the sciences.<br/><br/>The cell walls of angiosperms are composed of a complex arrangement of cellulose, hemicellulose and pectin. The pectins can be selectively and locally modified to be cross-linked into a structural network that can have dramatic effects on cell enlargement.  Localized digestion by plant secreted polygalacturonases can also modify the pectin network by loosening the cell wall to permit directional expansion of cells. Numerous pathogens and mechanical disruptions fragment pectin, often leading to a plant stress response. This project involves the Wall Associated Kinases  (WAKs) that bind to both long polymers of cross-linked pectin and to pathogen and damage induced pectin fragments, or  oligo-galacturonides (OGs). WAKs bound to native polymers are required for normal cell expansion, but bind newly generated OGs with higher affinity, and subsequently activate a distinct stress response pathway. This project will characterize receptor like kinases, cytoplasmic kinases, and potential scaffolding proteins that are phosphorylated upon OG treatment of Arabidopsis.  The role of each of the 5 individual WAK isoforms, clustered in one 30 kb locus in Arabidopsis will be genetically dissected using a new CRISPR/Cas9 based WAK deletion mutant. The puzzle is how one receptor type can distinguish and respond in different ways to different types of pectin, during development and the response to environmental disturbance. The goal is to understand if this is achieved through different WAKs each binding different pectins, and in combination with different co-receptors and ligands to activate alternate pathways."

Determining the meteoric mass distribution is critical for characterizing the mass input into the mesosphere -- including the metal deposition -- which plays a significant role in the local chemical processes. The meteoric mass is then transported to the middle atmosphere, where coupling with the lower atmosphere occurs. The current models for predicting the speed at which this transport occurs are sensitive to small changes in the total flux of mass from meteors -- which is largely unknown over the observable mass range. The PIs approach of using both optical and radar techniques simultaneously will enable an effective cross-calibration of the two techniques for calculating meteor mass, resulting in a significantly more accurate estimate of the total meteor mass input. <br/><br/>In this study, simultaneous optical and radar observations of meteor head echoes are proposed to set constraints on luminosity and ionization efficiencies, respectively, in order to determine meteoroid mass in the 100 microgram to 100 milligram range. Current data sets of common-volume radar and optical observations of meteors from several different radars are be used to address the science goals. Additional campaigns are proposed at specific radar sites, in order to improve and enhance the meteoroid mass and flux estimates based on lessons learned and the limitations of the current data. The main result expected is the production of mass distribution indexes of meteors from the sporadic meteor complex. The use of multiple radars will allow different regions of the sky -- both Southern and Northern -- to be covered and enable the detection of a large range of masses due to the varying sensitivities of the radars. There is a lack of knowledge in several important areas in this whole process and the proposed research will be a valuable tool in solving several issues, such as the formation of noctilucent and polar stratospheric clouds and the presence of meteoric dust. As a result of the review process and careful consideration, this proposal is funded for a period of three years."

These sensors are used to facilitate the high throughput screening of chiral catalysts for the asymmetric synthesis of chiral amines that are useful in the synthesis of organic compounds of pharmaceutical and biological importance.  This project provides extensive education and training for graduate and undergraduate students in areas such as organic synthesis, spectroscopic study, and catalyst development.  This group also participates in an outreach program to carry out chemistry-based demonstrations for elementary school students and teachers.  This outreach program is dedicated to providing inquiry-based chemistry instruction at the elementary school level.<br/><br/>Enantioselective fluorescent sensors containing perfluoroalkyl chains are expected to be more soluble in fluorous solvents than in common organic solvents.  They are used to conduct the enantioselective fluorescent recognition of functional chiral amines such as diamines, amino alcohols and amino acids in fluorous solvents.  Pseudoenantiomeric pairs of such sensors are prepared.  In each pair there are two sensors having the opposite enantioselective fluorescent response with two distinctively different emission wavelengths upon interaction with the two enantiomers of a chiral amine substrate.  These sensors are applied to chiral catalyst screening.  A fluorous solution of a pseudoenantiomeric sensor pair are used to extract the products, generated from the chiral catalyst screening experiments conducted in common organic solvents or aqueous solution, into the fluorous phase.  Because only the sensors and their adducts with the chiral products could be dissolved in the fluorous phase, the interference of other species such as reagents, catalysts and starting materials is minimized.  Through fluorescent measurement, both the yield and enantiomeric composition of the chiral products is simultaneously determined.  The structure of the sensors is modified in order to conduct the enantioselective fluorescent recognition of un-functionalized amines.  The fluorous phase-based fluorescent detection of this project has potential to be automated to conduct high throughput catalyst screening.  Under the direction of PI, graduate students and undergraduate students of diverse backgrounds are recruited to conduct research in organic synthesis, spectroscopic studies, and catalyst development. Students will learn many laboratory skills that are useful for their future employment and allow them to make contributions to the society."

This research will focus on the Classic Maya polity of La Corona, located in northern Guatemala. This archaeological project will study the elusive topic of the administrative and economic behaviors which supported the political activities of a royal court for centuries. This project departs from others which have emphasized priestly kings and divine kingship as the focus of Classic Maya political activities because it focusses on the practical dimensions of power. The study of the everyday practicalities of ruling in Classic Maya society will help develop a more pragmatic model for the roles of both the elite and non-elite in the operation of an ancient political institution. While the Classic Maya were unique in many ways, their political institutions were functionally similar to that of other ancient complex societies. Thus, this project's approach is replicable and therefore should positively impact the broader field of anthropological archaeology. Moreover, by broadening our analytical scope, the study of ancient non-western political systems should shed light on studies of modern-day political and economic systems many of which derive from and incorporate such traditional elements.<br/><br/>Dr. Marcello Canuto, Maxime Lamoureux-St-Hilaire, and their research team will study key administrative buildings as well as the floors and refuse-disposal areas associated with the support-oriented section of the La Corona regal palace. Beyond traditional archaeological methods, this research project will employ proven interdisciplinary methods in order to reconstruct the economic behaviors of this ancient institution. Geochemical analyses will study trace-elements absorbed in the plastered floors of the palace, while soil flotation will be used to recover micro-artifacts embedded in those same floors, along with botanical remains recovered from refuse-disposal areas produced by this ancient royal court. These different techniques have only been recently applied jointly to study ancient architecture. The data produced by these interdisciplinary techniques are unique in that they will document several subtle markers of ancient behaviors which would not normally be recoverable by traditional archaeological techniques. The development of this innovative methodology to study the practical aspects of ancient political institutions may positively impact the broader field of anthropological archaeology. This project is part of the larger La Corona Regional Archaeological Project (PRALC), which operates in the northwest Petén Region of Guatemala; one of the most under-studied regions of the Maya world.

Furthermore, stone tools were recently discovered at Lomekwi, predating the origin of our genus Homo by over one half million years. This fieldwork will help uncover who the first toolmakers were and if there was something special about the environment of the region that spawned species diversity or the advance in technological behavior. The project will strengthen international collaborative ties between the United States and Kenya, and educate students from both countries working together in paleontology and public outreach. The project will bring journalism students, education specialists and scientists together to collaborate in developing middle school and high school teaching materials on human prehistory and science designed to meet Next Generation educational standards for national distribution.<br/><br/>Paleontological research at Lomekwi is aimed at recovering more hominin fossils (3.5-3.3 Ma) and characterizing their paleoecological context. Until recently, the only known middle Pliocene hominin was Australopithecus afarensis, and hominin diversity appeared to have blossomed only later. With additional fossil data, it now appears that more than one hominin, and perhaps several, coexisted in the mid-Pliocene, most notably Kenyanthropus platyops from Lomekwi. Also, the recent announcement of 3.3 Ma stone tools from Lomekwi suggests that at least some pre-Homo hominins had more advanced material culture earlier than previously imagined. The appearance of stone tools and hominin diversity raises fundamental questions about local and regional environmental and/or biogeographic factors that may have influenced hominins in West Turkana in the mid-Pliocene.  Finding more fossils at Lomekwi stands to reveal how many hominins were present at that time, whether K. platyops is indeed a valid taxon, who the Lomekwian tool makers may have been, and what paleoenvironmental factors may have influenced their diversity and behavior.

Coral reefs are among the most threatened ecosystems under a changing climate and are rapidly declining due to increasing levels of environmental stress, namely increased temperatures. Climate change is resulting in even warmer ocean temperatures that threaten associations between Symbiodinium and their hosts. In this project the investigators examine the genetic diversity of Symbiodinium and the potential for this important species to evolve in response to temperature. The project will also address whether the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of the Symbiodinium population affect the performance of their host. If so, this suggests that the evolution of microscopic organisms with short generation times could confer adaptation to longer-lived host species on ecologically and economically vital coral reefs. Given that diversity is already being lost on many reefs, considering how evolutionary changes in Symbiodinium will affect reef species is crucial for predicting the responses of reefs to future climate change. This project provides training for two graduate students and several undergraduates at a Hispanic-serving institution. This work includes outreach to the students and the general public through the Aquarium of Niagara, local K-12 schools, and web-based education modules. <br/><br/>The effects of evolution on contemporary ecological processes are at the forefront of research in evolutionary ecology. This project will answer the call for experiments elucidating the effects of genetic variation in Symbiodinium performance and the effect on the response of the holobiont (host and symbiont) to increased temperature. These experiments examine the effects of temperature through both ecological and evolutionary mechanisms and will determine the relative importance of adaptation and acclimatization in replicated experimental populations. The investigators will examine how genetic variation within a species (Symbiodinium antillogorgium) affects symbiont performance in culture and in the host and how this affects the response of the holobiont to increased temperature. Further, the project examines whether holobiont response to increased temperature associated with climate change depends on particular GxG host-symbiont combinations. Moreover, the investigators will examine the effects of symbiont history on mutualist hosts, which have been largely ignored in eco-evolutionary studies. These experiments provide a first step in predicting whether invertebrate hosts on coral reefs will respond to global change via adaptation of their symbionts."

This project will intensively sample and analyze fossil plants and animals from Patagonia through about 20 million years, from just before the end-Cretaceous dinosaur extinction (66 million years ago), through the early recovery period and the Eocene warming interval.

The field of ""computational  complexity"", which is the subject of the PIs' project, seeks to mathematically prove that certain computational problems do not admit *any* efficient algorithm no matter how long and hard we try to develop one.  Such results can have both practical value (by guiding algorithm development away from ""dead ends"") and deep theoretical significance, as they play a profound role in shaping our fundamental understanding of the phenomenon of computation.<br/><br/>The 1980s witnessed exciting progress on a range of Boolean circuit models (a mathematical abstraction of the digital circuits that modern computers are built from) in computational complexity; researchers succeeded in proving many lower bounds establishing that various computational problems have no efficient algorithms in these models.  However, further progress slowed significantly after the 1980s. Many of the landmark results obtained in this era were based on the ""method of random restrictions"", which roughly speaking uses probabilistic arguments to show that Boolean circuits can be dramatically simplified by making certain random substitutions of constant values for input variables.  In this project the PIs will intensively investigate an extension of the method of random restrictions which they call the ""method of random projections."" Rather than simply substituting constant values for input variables, the random projection method additionally identifies groups of variables, ""projecting"" them all to the same new variable so that they must all take the same value.  While the underlying idea is simple, it turns out that this identification of variables helps ""maintain useful structure"" which is extremely useful for proving lower bounds.  In recent work the PIs have successfully used this new ""method of random projections"" to solve several decades-old problems in Boolean circuit lower bounds and related areas (which in some cases had notoriously resisted progress since the 1980s or 1990s).  As the main intellectual goals of the project, the PIs will continue to develop and apply the method of random projections to attack important open problems in Boolean circuit complexity.<br/><br/>In addition to the technical goals described above, other central goals of the project are to educate, communicate, and inspire.  The PIs will train graduate students through research collaboration, disseminate research results through seminar talks, survey articles and other publications, and continue ongoing outreach activities aimed at increasing interest in and awareness of theoretical computer science topics in a broader population, including presentations at elementary schools."

The projects deal with issues in data preprocessing, estimation, and hypothesis testing. The emphasis is on methods with broad applicability and that can be put to practical use. The proposed research is also multidisciplinary, combining methodologies from statistics with those from computer science, while providing methods for empirical researchers from any field that uses statistical methods on massive data sets.<br/><br/>The proposed research consists of three projects. The first project develops methods for efficient and effective analysis of big data for the purpose of understanding micro and macroeconomic phenomenon. While datasets that are terabytes in size are increasingly available, resource constraints often make it necessary to study a smaller set of observations, which raises the question about how to form subsamples. The investigator will develop methods that can efficiently use large datasets, while preserving data features valuable to economic analysis. The second project provides frequentist tools to assess sensitivity of the estimation results to model assumptions and features of the data, which will be particularly useful to assess the results from complex structural models. The third project will assess whether uncertainty is a cause or a consequence of economic fluctuations.  Given that there is no ideal instrument to distinguish uncertainty shocks from real activity shocks, the investigator will develop an iterative method that would purge the unwarranted variations from a potentially invalid instrument in order to arrive at a valid instrument. This generated external IV procedure can generally be used in applications when no valid instrument is available."

As a measure of protection to consumers, faucet-mounted point-of-use filters are being deployed across the city at a scale not previously seen in the United States. The point-of-use filters distributed in Flint are rated for a maximum lead concentration of 150 ppb; however, concentrations of more than 40 times that were observed in January 2016. Therefore, there is an immediate need to rapidly evaluate the treatment efficiency of PoU filters. This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) grant provides a unique opportunity to advance fundamental scientific knowledge regarding physical-chemical process responsible for lead and DBP removal while simultaneously ensuring public health. Controlled laboratory experiments will be conducted to determine treatment efficiency under the range of conditions observed in Flint. These results will be compared to those obtained from filters in homes where filters are subjected to typical use conditions that often deviate significantly from conditions used to certify chemical removal efficiency.<br/><br/>Studies will be conducted to evaluate two hypotheses: (1) lead and copper removal by the ion exchange resin will be reduced by competition from other cations and dissolved organic matter present in Flint drinking water, and, (2) adsorption of trihalomethanes on the activated carbon filtration media will decrease with increasing disinfectant dosage. This work will advance the understanding of the removal of lead, copper and disinfection by-products under real world conditions where complex interactions with colloids and dissolved organic matter occur. The work will utilize controlled laboratory experiments, conducted in state-of-the-art facilities at two major research universities (Wayne State University and Michigan State University) with a strong commitment to collaborative and innovative research. The proposed study will help protect human health and improve the security of municipal water supplies. Laboratory experiments and field sampling will be done in collaboration with Michigan State University and University of Michigan, focused on microbial conditions within point-of-use filters. Results of this study will be disseminated with the assistance of another faculty at Wayne State University, whose research focuses on translating scientific information to the public. Graduate and undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in science and engineering will conduct experiments and collect field samples providing hands on training in the areas of water treatment, colloid chemistry, and disinfection processes. Skills these students obtain will be invaluable in advancing the protection of the nation's water supply. Additionally, the project team will develop and provide lectures and special programs on issues related to aging infrastructure and corrosion control that will be presented at regional meetings of the American Water Works Association."

Policy makers and the public rely on model projections of these changes. This research will develop strategies to validate model simulations with analytic theory, to identify and correct model biases, and to establish rigorous test to assess their fitness for climate projection. This project will also support the education and training of two graduate students. providing them the opportunity to develop a physical understanding of the atmospheric circulation and practical experience with high performance scientific computing. <br/><br/>This project will connect theory, modeling, and observations of stratospheric transport. The Brewer-Dobson Circulation describes the transport of mass and trace gases through the stratosphere. In concert with chemical processes, it sets the distribution of water vapor and ozone through the middle atmosphere. Models nearly unanimously predict the Brewer-Dobson Circulation to increase in response to anthropogenic forcing, but the circulation cannot be observed directly, due to the slow time scale of overturning (on the order of years). In situ and satellite-based estimates of the ""age of air,"" a measure of the transport time from the surface to stratosphere which can be estimated from observations of trace gases, however, do not robustly detect a change in transport. Some even suggest a weakening of the circulation, although large uncertainties imply that model trends are not inconsistent. <br/><br/>The first goal of this project is to establish a connection between the stratospheric circulation and age distributions with three-dimensional atmospheric models. In particular, the latitudinal structure of age, which can be calculated directly from measurements of trace gases such as CO2 or SF6, will be related to the mean circulation of mass, which is diagnosed in climate model integrations. The second goal is to use these insights to evaluate stratospheric transport in numerical models, connecting standard tests of dynamical cores to the climatological properties of the circulation. Theoretical constraints on age transport will be used to detect biases in climate models arising from deficiencies in their representation of the circulation and/or tracer transport. The third and final goal is to evaluate the new tracer-transport diagnostics in the context of climate change."

The westerly wind belt is associated with the mid-latitude jet stream in the upper troposphere and it also influences the strength and position of fronts and mid-latitude storm systems. Despite the importance of the westerly jet on mid-latitude weather and climate, complex interactions between motions on a variety of different spatial and temporal scales makes understanding the important dynamical mechanisms controlling the strength and position of the mid-latitude jet very difficult. Progress has been made by separating the total flow into two components: 1) the background westerly flow, which is defined as the winds averaged in the east/west direction around the entire globe, and 2) the waves, which are defined as the difference between the total flow and the background flow. Recently, the PI has developed a methodology to separate the various mechanisms whereby the background westerly flow affects the waves. Because the role of the waves on the background flow is already well understood, this new methodology can be used to understand how the waves and the background flow interact to determine 1) the leading patterns of natural variability and 2) the response to external forcing, such as increasing greenhouse gases. <br/><br/>This study extends previous work by applying the new methodology to state-of-the-art climate models and observations. This will determine the reasons for climate model biases in the mid-latitude circulation that will then help lead to model improvements and therefore more credible predictions of future climate change. For example, the natural variability of the mid-latitude jet is too persistent in time in climate models and moreover this bias has been shown to affect the magnitude of the response to increasing greenhouse gases. The new methodology is ideally suited to separate the proposed reasons for this bias: 1) the mean westerlies are too far equatorward in the climate models or, 2) the planetary wave activity is too weak in the climate models. In addition, the methodology is ideally suited to separate the proposed reasons for latitudinal shifts in the position of the westerlies in response to increased greenhouse gases.<br/><br/>Changes in simulated climate should be considered credible only to the extent that model spread is small. In this research, the reasons for the model spread in the westerly jet response and variability will be diagnosed so that the models can be improved. These improvements are important because increasing greenhouse gases tend to shift the position of the westerlies toward the poles. Furthermore, such latitudinal shifts in the position of the westerlies are a major component of the natural year-to-year variability in the mid-latitudes. For example, an extreme equatorward shift in the mid-latitude jet led to the extremely cold, snowy winter of 2009-2010 in the mid-latitudes of the Northern Hemisphere. A similar situation occurred in March 2013. Besides temperature and precipitation, these shifts in the westerlies also have many other impacts including poleward moisture transport, the earth radiation budget via cloudiness, the ocean circulation and sea ice. This project will have additional broader impacts because the PI is active in the climate impacts community. The PI's familiarity and access to climate model simulations through this and other projects enables him to provide essential information on the robustness of the climate information that these users need. In addition, after publication of the results, the code for the methodology used in this project will be made public on the PI's web site for other groups to diagnose and understand their own simulations and observations. This work will also train a Ph.D. graduate student."

This surgery involves cutting out a damaged portion of an esophagus (i.e. a tumor) and then replacing the missing esophageal tissue by<br/>pulling up the stomach (i.e. gastric pull-up). This causes a very low quality of life for the patient because the stomach is not a suitable replacement for an esophagus, often requiring patients to rely on feeding tubes for the length of their survival. Furthermore, post-operative complication rates are as high as 80% and the 5-year survival rate is less than 20%. In order to avoid a gastric pull-up surgery and spare the stomach, this I-Corps team aims to implant the proposed absorbable medical device into the excised damaged portion of the esophagus, promoting functional esophageal tissue regeneration within the body. Ultimately, this will improve the quality of life and survival of the patients, while substantially decreasing reimbursable medical costs than compared to a standard esophagectomy procedure. The proposed device will treat patients that suffer from advanced Barrett's Esophagus (chronic regurgitation of stomach acid), esophageal cancer, esophageal birth defects, and injury to the esophagus due to caustic ingestion of poisons.<br/><br/>This I-Corps team is developing an implantable, bioresorbable medical device to functionally regenerate a damaged esophagus.

This team plans to conduct customer interviews with thoracic surgeons, anesthesiologists, and gastroenterologists during the I-Corps program.  The team would like to initiate a large pig study, yielding proof-of-concept that the proposed device is capable of regenerating a damaged esophagus in humans. A more pragmatic proof-of-concept study at the end of the I-Corps project is demonstrating biocompatibility, biodegradability, and immune tolerance of the proposed device in mouse models.  This would provide the team significant information to successfully apply for other grants such as the NSF SBIR Phase I."

Animals as pets provide companionship and well documented health benefits. Zoos and aquariums are often public cultural institutions, and licensed animal exhibitors can be found in all the major cities in the United States. Research on drugs, behavior, and development require the use of live animals. For example, by law a drug cannot be brought to market without testing on live animals. For each of these valuable ways animals help us, there is a heavy workload of animal care and data collection. When the workload cannot be met, animals from home pets to zoo favorites suffer from a lower quality of life, and the value of what we get from animals is reduced. Heavy workloads lead to poor data, fewer pets, and sad looking zoo animals. The proposed project focuses on a system, similar to a video game system, that allows for automation of animal-related activities. This proposed system can give animals physical toys and puzzles to keep them busy, provide fun challenges for them to solve, and reward them for physical exercise all of which help keep the animals physically and mentally healthy. It will also provide new ways for people to bond with their pets, automatically conduct experiments, and record data.<br/><br/>The goal of this I-Corps project is to identify the market need for devices which can improve animal welfare and automate data collection. This team will extensively interview in three potential market areas: pet owners, research laboratory decision makers, and zoo & aquarium staff. As the team members explore the market need, they will tailor their prototype system to meet market needs. The team will utilize the Schubot Exotic Bird Health Center at Texas A&M University to field test and scientifically validate the prototypes, then revisit their market areas with a product demonstration. If successful, they will develop a low cost, simple to use system that will allow animal caretakers, exhibitors, and researchers to automate much of their animal research and husbandry tasks. In this way the team will allow 1) pet owners to keep their animals busy and happy when they are away and to derive more benefits from pet ownership, 2) researchers to more efficiently and economically provide enrichment and run experiments, and 3) zookeepers to develop new interactive displays and provide highly stimulating activities for their animals.

The M&O activities are built upon eight highly successful years of managing the overall ICNO operations after the start of science operations in 2008. Construction of ICNO was supported by NSF's Major Research Equipment and Facilities Construction (MREFC) account and was completed on schedule and within budget in 2010.

This tool will also have greater societal benefits including improving agricultural practices and deeper insights into environmental biology, which is necessary for protecting the environment. This is multidisciplinary work that combines engineering, nanofabrication, chemistry, physics, and biology and provides a great opportunity to educate and train graduate students, undergraduates, and high school students.  One of the important educational outcomes of the proposed research includes building teaching modules that will be incorporated into a massive open online course (MOOC) in biosensor and bioinstrumentation development. Collaborations will be developed with the Rutgers Office for Diversity and Academic Success in the Sciences to attract under-represented students to the study of STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>The proposed sample-to-answer portable protein analyzer to be developed will utilize 1) on-chip microfluidic sample preparation, 2) decoupled digital protein detection for quantification of low abundance proteins 3) nanoelectronic barcoding of beads for enabling multiplexing capability, and 4) on-chip magnet based fluidic peristaltic pumping for maintaining an ultra-compact footprint. Nanoelectronic barcoding works by fabricating tunable nano-capacitors on the microparticle surface, effectively modulating the frequency dependent dielectric properties of the particles allowing one bead barcode to be distinguished from another, potentially on the scale of 100-fold multiplexing. By using electronic based solutions for all of the key modules of the proposed instrument, the cost and size of the readout instrumentation can be significantly reduced, thus truly enabling on-the-field analysis. The devices will be validated in the field with environmental samples, benchmarking for detection limit, accuracy, and assay time for a panel of photosynthesis proteins from the green alga Picochlorum. The results will be shared with the engineering and experimental biology communities via presentations at professional meetings and submission to peer-reviewed journals. The research value of the instrument will be broadly disseminated through partnerships with the Rutgers BioMAPS Institute for Quantitative Biology and the Rutgers Center for Integrated Proteomic Research. To prepare for commercialization of the technology and broad distribution, there will be close collaboration with the Rutgers Center for Innovative Ventures of Emerging Technologies and the Rutgers Office of Technology Commercialization."

Acquisition of resistance to antibiotics in bacteria is one of the many ways in which such gene swapping impacts society. Because of the potentially tremendous benefit to their survival, bacteria have developed a large arsenal of mechanisms for gene trade. One enigmatic gene exchange mechanism involves shuttling genes packaged in particles (so-called Gene Transfer Agents) that resemble bacterial viruses. This raises many questions about the origin and functionality of this mechanism. How beneficial is it to exchange genes this way? Do Gene Transfer Agents represent former viruses that were ""domesticated"" by bacteria?  Bacterial viruses are numerically the most abundant organisms on Earth. Could many of these viruses in fact be Gene Transfer Agents? Answers to these questions will advance our understanding of how gene exchange contributes to bacterial adaptation. Because of accumulating evidence that Gene Transfer Agents are of use to a microbial population as a whole rather than to an individual cell, this project will also advance our knowledge on the origin and maintenance of cooperation, a long-standing mystery of evolutionary biology. Since bacteria and viruses are key players in all Earth environments, including human bodies, the project will benefit both the scientific community and broader society. <br/><br/>Researchers at Dartmouth College will investigate the above questions via computational analyses of genetic information from marine bacteria. Those bacteria are key players in Earth's nutrient cycling and ocean habitability. Genes encoding Gene Transfer Agents (GTAs) will be identified and extracted from bacterial genomes and oceanic metagenomes. These GTAs will then be rigorously compared to similar genes from bacterial viruses. The comparison will assess the GTA's evolutionary relationship to viruses and the selective pressure exerted on their genes by bacterial hosts.  Given the recent discovery of the GTA system and its resemblance to actual viruses, many true GTAs in available genomic sequences could be mistakenly annotated as integrated bacterial viruses. To address this important issue, the researchers will develop a novel bioinformatic method that aims to successfully distinguish Gene Transfer Agents from their viral counterparts. Ultimately, this cross-disciplinary project will contribute to better understanding of oceanic and global elemental cycles and of adaptive evolutionary processes that drive bacterial populations in marine and other environments. The data sets and computer programs generated in this project will be shared with scientific community."

Diffusivities of REE derived from two past studies differ by 3~4 orders of magnitude, which has profound implications for the interpretation of questions such as how fast basaltic magmas ascend from depths in the Earth and planetary interiors and if chemical variations observed in olivine-hosted melt inclusions are reliable records of mantle source heterogeneity. If REE diffusion in olivine is indeed very fast, conclusions derived from recent studies must be re-evaluated. For that reason, the petrology and geochemistry community is interested in clarifying the issue quickly. This EaGER will provide support for the training of a post-doctoral fellow. <br/><br/>The project will integrate theoretical, analytical and experimental approaches to evaluate and determine the source of discrepancy in the two data sets. The team hypothesizes that there is a possibility that two time scales for REE diffusion in olivine may operate under specific conditions. In order to test this hypothesis, the team will conduct a series of laboratory diffusion experiments to evaluate if the presence of major element concentration gradients, differing REE concentrations, and substitutional mechanisms are at the source of the discrepant results from different studies. The experiments will be accompanied by closure temperatures determinations of REE and Ca-Fe-Mg in olivine from natural samples using a new REE-in-olivine-clinopyroxene thermometer, enabling a better comparison of relative diffusion rates between the trivalent and divalent cations in olivine from mafic and ultramafic rocks that experienced different cooling rates. To better understand diffusion measurements from the two laboratories and their connection to observations in natural samples, the team also plans to undertake a theoretical study examining the effects of major element concentration gradient and chemical strain energy on REE diffusion in olivine. The ultimate goal of this EaGER study is not only to resolve the controversy surrounding REE diffusion in olivine, but also to develop a framework for understanding the time scales of diffusion for the trace elements and major elements during multicomponent diffusion in other rock-forming minerals."

This project investigates the patterns of pleiotropy in a model organism to see whether those effects are typically restricted to one simple part of the body, or are likely to have effects on many different parts.  If the team finds that a DNA change generally affects many traits, then this will suggest that those studying human genomes will have to look at diverse traits to understand how DNA changes affect specific aspects of heath.

Flint, MI, is currently suffering from a ""perfect storm"" attributable to out-of-control corrosion of its potable water distribution system. In addition to concerns about lead, there are excessive disinfection by-products in the water, and, the poor bacterial quality associated with drinking water is also of concern. As one measure of protection to consumers, faucet-mounted point-of-use filters are being deployed for long-term use in the city at a scale not previously seen in the US. This project will investigate point-of-use filters for Flint water, with particular attention to the potential for changes as the water and infrastructure warm in the summer months.<br/><br/>Well maintained point-of-use devices will certainly remove some of the chemical water contaminants; however, the opposite is typically true for microbiological contaminants. Previously, the PIs have shown in multiple and repeated tests that point-of-use filters increase the abundance and alter the composition of microbial communities in drinking water, even when filters are used in accordance with manufacturer guidelines. The PIs work has also shown that trace levels of a surrogate unregulated disinfection by-product altered the composition of the microbial community in the effluent of a point-of-use filter, suggesting that contaminants in the drinking water coupled with use of a point-of-use device alters the microbial risk a consumer is exposed to. In the case of Flint, it is not known how recovery of the distribution system and premise plumbing from the corrosion period will impact the microbial water quality applied to the point-of-use filters, and how influent changes will, in turn, influence the microbial quality of the water produced by the filter. Furthermore, it is unreasonable to think that a single point-of-use device on a faucet is sufficient, given that it does not achieve the conventional drinking water treatment paradigm that is to use multiple treatment barriers to protect public health from multiple contaminants. The PIs have extensive experience interrogating point-of-use filters like those used in Flint for changes in water quality, microbial abundance and composition using a range of current methods and can mobilize quickly. The PIs propose to complete a sampling campaign of faucet mounted point-of-use filters in Flint, Michigan over the spring, summer and fall 2016 to evaluate changes in the microbiological quality of point-of-use-treated water. The analyses will include culture-based and culture-independent methods to determine microbial community composition, specific species and/or genes that can impact public health. It is hypothesized that there will be higher levels of microbial growth across the system during the summertime. Previous studies showed significantly elevated levels of Mycobacterium, a family of bacteria known to include opportunistic pathogens, in the filter housing and moderate yet significant increases in the filter effluent. The importance of point-of-use filters in mitigating the chemical contaminants of concern is acknowledged, but a balance is needed to achieve acceptable microbiological water quality. Given the unknown consequences of the corrosion damage of Flints drinking water pipes on the microbial quality and disinfectant residuals in the distributed water, it is important to evaluate the microbiological quality of point-of-use filters in order to establish good monitoring and filter maintenance practices to assist in setting a point-of-use filter maintenance strategy for Flint, which is a major outcome of our proposed effort. This is particularly important to engage in immediately and through the rest of this year since the use of filters is expected to continue for several months."

The liquids from fast pyrolysis from biomass show promise for the production of advanced biofuels and biobased chemicals that resemble conventional gasoline and diesel fuels produced from petroleum. Understanding the chemical reactions that occur during fast pyrolysis and measuring their rates are important for designing future biorefineries that would convert biomass into fuels and chemicals. This project will explore new experimental techniques for probing reactions that occur in solid biomass after it has been rapidly heated to high temperatures in a matter of seconds. By tracking the change in concentration of various decomposition products with time, rates of important pyrolysis reactions can be determined. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to measure the chemical kinetics of biomass fast pyrolysis through time-resolved measurements of condensed phase reactions. Pyrolysis is the basis for most thermochemical processes including combustion, gasification, fast pyrolysis, and even solvent liquefaction.  Among these technologies, fast pyrolysis has gained considerable attention in the last few years for its prospects to produce advanced biofuels and biobased chemicals from lignocellulosic biomass.  The reaction mechanisms of pyrolysis have been studied since the 1950s, but only modest progress has been made in determining elementary reaction rates associated with the depolymerization of the biopolymers that make up lignocellulosic biomass.  Without rate coefficients and activation energies for these reactions, it is difficult to accurately model and design pyrolysis reactors from first principles.  Most previous studies of pyrolysis kinetics have measured weight loss of samples undergoing relatively slow heating, which yields little information about elementary reactions occurring in solid biomass. This research will demonstrate the utility of two versions of Controlled Pyrolysis Duration (CPD) - Quench reactors developed at Iowa State University for studying condensed phase elementary chemical reactions. The first, capable of investigating reactions that occur on the order of a few seconds, will be used to study unzipping of small oligosaccharides to form the anhydro-monosaccharide levoglucosan.  The second, capable of investigating much faster reactions, will be used to study cracking of cellulose to oligosaccharides early in the depolymerization process. These apparatus will also be employed to study depolymerization of hemicellulose and lignin."

Some of these events appear to have caused major extinctions, and in net, the erupted lavas cover a significant portion of the Earth; they also represent the beginning of hotspots such as Yellowstone. The most recent and best-exposed flood basalt event erupted about 16 million years ago from eastern Oregon. This is the target of our study. The fundamental driving mechanism for flood basalt eruptions occurs below the lithospheric plate, and the event has a major effect on modifying the plate. Yet, we do not understand the fundamentals of these events. It our case, there is strong evidence that large pieces of the affected lithosphere foundered and sank into the asthenosphere, and that the distribution of the foundering lithosphere controlled the location and distribution of volcanism. Our study will use seismic imaging methods to image the structures created and modified by this event, both in the crust and in the underlying lithosphere and asthenosphere, with the specific goals of finding the primary magma chamber(s) and resolving their shape.<br/><br/>We will deploy about 60 seismometers in a line extending north 150 km from the center of the main eruptive center in northeast Oregon into southwest Washington, out of the eruptive area. We will use seismic waves that propagate up from distant earthquakes that occur around the world. The two primary techniques to be employed involve (1) the conversion of P waves to S waves that occurs when the wave hits an interface (such as the boundaries of the now-frozen magma chamber(s) we are studying), and (2) the time advance (or delay) that occurs for each ray as it passes through the region of interest. These delays are used to make a tomographic image of the major volumes of Earth that have been created by the flood basalt event."

However, preliminary analysis of historical data and synthesis of previous regional studies indicate there are large regional differences in the amplitude of the annual cycle. For example, the<br/>average temperature difference between August and February is less than 5 C along much of the U.S. West Coast, but is between 15 and 20 C along the East Coast. While there are also large regional differences in the annual cycle of surface heat, the surface heat fluxes do not generally account for the observed amplitude of the annual cycle or the regional differences. Both these results and previous<br/>studies indicate that advective heat fluxes are important over the inner shelf and that they tend to buffer the response to surface heat fluxes and lead to important biological and societal implications. Thermal stresses play a key role in both organism function and community ecology, and small increases in inner shelf temperatures or alterations in the processes that control them can lead to dramatic shifts in community structure and/or mass mortality events. Thus, a clear understanding of how buffering by advection functions would allow some predictive capacity for the potential changes in both ecologically and commercially important coastal marine species in future climate scenarios. This research project aims to understand the processes controlling water temperature variations over the inner shelf on annual and interannual timescales. The project involves training of a graduate student.<br/><br/>This study will provide the first comprehensive look at the heat budget of the inner continental shelf, including its seasonal cycle and inter-annual variability. Available temperature and velocity data sets will be used to examine how the heat balance can be maintained by a number of possible sources of cooling including: across-shelf exchange due to depth-dependent upwelling, the along-shelf advection of an along-shelf temperature gradient, and the across-shelf exchange due to eddies. The results will be synthesized to determine the relative contributions of heat flux components and their associated processes for the different shelf regions of the continental US.  The analysis will enable an assessment of the role of shelf environment (e.g. width) versus external forcing (e.g. surface heat flux, wind stress) in driving the regional temperature patterns observed. The results will yield new information about inner-shelf circulation, the role of advection in controlling or moderating inner-shelf heating, as well as give broader context to previous studies of across-shelf exchange in the coastal ocean."

This heating of seawater to temperatures as high as 400°C, as it circulates through the ocean crust, results in extensive chemical reactions that modify the fluid's composition to something that is acidic, metal- and sulfide-rich, and highly reducing. Venting of these fluids at the seafloor and mixing with seawater creates a chemical environment that supports large microbial ecosystems that do not rely on the sun (photosynthesis) as a source of energy. Instead, they are sustained by catalyzing chemical reactions that occur when hot and reduced hydrothermal fluids mix with cold oxidized seawater. The ability of microbes to utilize these reactions as an energy source is highly dependent on the abundance and composition of chemical compounds that participate in these types of oxidation-reduction reactions. This research conducts laboratory experiments to determine the rate of abiotic (i.e., not involving life) chemical reactions that produce or consume chemical compounds used by deep sea microbes. These data improve our understanding of how subsurface microbes and the higher order marine ecosystems, that rely on these microbes as the base of the food web, thrive on the bottom of the seafloor thousands of feet below the sea surface. Broader impacts of the work include a substantial educational component that provides state-of-the-art research experiences for 25 undergraduate science majors at a primarily undergraduate institution (Bridgewater State University) through partnership with a major oceanographic research institution (the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution). This integration of research and education includes the development and implementation of a research course, offered at Bridgewater State, and intensive summer research experiences at Woods Hole. The goal is to provide undergraduates with opportunities to experience all aspects of the scientific process, including background research, data collection, analysis and interpretation, and presentation of results at a national conference in order to better prepare them for employment and graduate study.<br/><br/>This research consists of laboratory experiments that investigate abiotic redox reactions in subsurface mixing zones in seafloor hydrothermal systems. Using a novel laboratory reactor, experiments investigate chemical disequilibria between key redox reactive species in seawater (e.g., H2, H2S, Fe2+, CH4, O2, SO42-, CO2, NO3-), which comprise a major source of chemical energy that supports complex subsurface ecosystems. At present, such reactions are poorly constrained in hydrothermal environments, so this work identifies these reactions and determines their rates at low to moderate temperatures that characterize subsurface mixing zones within hydrothermal systems. The resulting data will allow improvement of models of hydrothermal vent microbial metabolic pathways. Experiments will take place using an open-system flow-through reaction cell that is able to regulate the concentration of H2, O2, H2S, NO3-, and intermediate oxidation state sulfur and nitrogen species as a function of temperature and pH. Data will be used to place fundamental constraints on thermodynamic models used to predict the amount of chemical energy delivered to vent ecosystems, which should lead to an improved understanding of the linkages between chemical environment and biological community composition and function."

The loss of these students who are interested in STEM fields contributes to the relative dearth in quantity of STEM majors needed to support the US economy.  Lyman Briggs College at Michigan State University has developed a strong entry program focused on INstilling QUantitative and Integrative Reasoning (INQUIRE) to help these students overcome their lower math preparation and successfully enter into the college science curriculum.  However, the factors that lead to low math proficiency also correlate notably with low socioeconomic status and very high levels of financial need. Thus although the students who complete the INQUIRE program are able to academically succeed in college science courses, their ability to succeed in college is frequently still hindered by financial considerations (including high debt burden and the need to dedicate precious hours to working jobs for income, rather than focusing on academic endeavors).  The SPRING program will support students who are talented with demonstrated financial need in two cohorts starting in their second year of college through to graduation.  The SPRING scholars will be supported with 1) scholarships, 2) the development of a cohort with strong faculty mentorship, and 3) professional career skills development and network building.  The experience of each student will be closely monitored through interviews to better understand which aspect of the program were most beneficial and why.  Additionally, we will use data analytics to compare the retention and graduation rates of the students involved in the SPRING program to matched students not participating in the program.<br/><br/>This project will support a minimum of 26 scholars across a range of STEM disciplines in their pursuit of a bachelor's degree.  Students will receive up to $3000 in the first year, $6000 in the second and $9000 in the final year. The SPRING program will help scholars investigate the breadth of possibilities in science careers and help them make informed decisions about their career path. Throughout the project, the project team will employ semi-structured interviews, student self-reflections, and data analytics to evaluate the efficacy of the program. Specifically, the team will investigate 1) how the SPRING program impacts students with low incoming math proficiency, 2) what barriers to graduation remain for low math proficiency after the INQUIRE program, 3) what value students perceive for the different components of the program, 4) the impact of the inflating nature of the scholarship program, and 5) the result of the impact of the SPRING program on student retention, graduation rates, and career paths. Findings will be disseminated and will add to the growing literature relevant for institutions working on effective ways to support entering students with weaker mathematics preparation."

Coral reefs are among the most threatened ecosystems under a changing climate and are rapidly declining due to increasing levels of environmental stress, namely increased temperatures. Climate change is resulting in even warmer ocean temperatures that threaten associations between Symbiodinium and their hosts. In this project the investigators examine the genetic diversity of Symbiodinium and the potential for this important species to evolve in response to temperature. The project will also address whether the ecological and evolutionary dynamics of the Symbiodinium population affect the performance of their host. If so, this suggests that the evolution of microscopic organisms with short generation times could confer adaptation to longer-lived host species on ecologically and economically vital coral reefs. Given that diversity is already being lost on many reefs, considering how evolutionary changes in Symbiodinium will affect reef species is crucial for predicting the responses of reefs to future climate change. This project provides training for two graduate students and several undergraduates at a Hispanic-serving institution. This work includes outreach to the students and the general public through the Aquarium of Niagara, local K-12 schools, and web-based education modules. <br/><br/>The effects of evolution on contemporary ecological processes are at the forefront of research in evolutionary ecology. This project will answer the call for experiments elucidating the effects of genetic variation in Symbiodinium performance and the effect on the response of the holobiont (host and symbiont) to increased temperature. These experiments examine the effects of temperature through both ecological and evolutionary mechanisms and will determine the relative importance of adaptation and acclimatization in replicated experimental populations. The investigators will examine how genetic variation within a species (Symbiodinium antillogorgium) affects symbiont performance in culture and in the host and how this affects the response of the holobiont to increased temperature. Further, the project examines whether holobiont response to increased temperature associated with climate change depends on particular GxG host-symbiont combinations. Moreover, the investigators will examine the effects of symbiont history on mutualist hosts, which have been largely ignored in eco-evolutionary studies. These experiments provide a first step in predicting whether invertebrate hosts on coral reefs will respond to global change via adaptation of their symbionts."

Nitrogen is extremely abundant in the atmosphere in the inert form of gaseous N2, but most organisms cannot reduce N2 into a biologically available form. In all environments, including agricultural soils, there are microorganisms that can make available the N from gaseous N2 by reducing it to the biologically available form, ammonium. In the vast expanses of the open ocean, few organisms are known to have this ability, and recently a unique symbiosis between a single-celled cyanobacterium and a single-celled algae was discovered, which appears to be very widely distributed and likely of global biogeochemical significance. The cyanobacterium in this symbiotic partnership has very unusual metabolism and genomic streamlining. Little is known of the symbiosis because it is not detectable except by modern molecular biological techniques. Recent work has shown this symbiosis to be very widely spread through the oceans, and that there is previously unrecognized diversity in both the cyanobacterial and algal hosts. This research will examine the environmental distributions and the biogeochemical significance of this diversity in coastal US waters. The investigators will engage the public in ocean sciences through internship programs at local high schools and for undergraduate students at Stanford, and by documenting their field research in a 'virtual cruise' blog.<br/><br/>In the marine environment, the contribution of N2 fixation to the fixed nitrogen (N) pool is poorly quantified, in part due to an incomplete understanding on the abundance, activity, and physiology of diazotrophs. The symbiotic unicellular cyanobacteria (UCYN-A) is a poorly characterized, yet globally important, group of marine diazotrophs. UCYN-A is widely distributed in the marine environment, and lives symbiotically with a picoeukaryotic prymnesiophyte alga. We now know that there are multiple ecotypes of UCYN-A, which may be adapted to specific locations in the water-column and different oceanic provinces. Typically N2 fixation was considered unimportant in coastally influenced and non-tropical waters, however recent data shows that multiple subclades of UCYN-A are present. The distribution and rate of N2 fixation by UCYN-A subclades in coastal/nearshore environments is a major unknown in the oceanic N cycle. Its presence in nearshore waters may change the paradigm of the balance between basin N sources (N2 fixation) and sinks (denitrification).  Likewise, significant N2 fixation by UCYN-A will need to be considered when determining estimates of new production in coastally influenced waters. This project aims to quantify the significance of different UCYN-A subclades to coastal/nearshore N budgets. It tackles the issue of determining N2 fixation rates by different UCYN-A subclades in coastal waters through rigorous fieldwork off the west coast of North America. The temporal and spatial distribution of UCYN-A subclades, as well as the rates of N2 fixation, will be determined by coupling N2 fixation measurements of bulk communities and individual cells (nanoSIMS) with molecular assays to study these widespread, but dilute, diazotrophic symbionts and their hosts. Additionally the investigators will conduct experiments aimed at constraining the effects of light and nutrient ratios (N/P) on UCYN-A N2 fixation rates, and the prymnesiophyte host's rate of carbon fixation. They will conduct this work through seasonal sampling of a coastal site in the Southern California Bight (Scripps Pier) and on two process cruises in the coastal waters between central California and the Baja Peninsula.  The cruise work will provide an opportunity to understand the temporal dynamics of the UCYN-A/prymnesiophyte associations over larger spatial scales. Finally, evidence suggests that unidentified UCYN-A subclades and hosts exist and the investigators have developed a strategy to identify and quantify their temporal and spatial distributions as well as their N2 fixation activities. Data on the coastal distribution, ecology and activity of UCYN-A is critical for obtaining a better understanding of their contribution to fixed N to the marine environment. The group-specific and bulk rates of N2 fixation measured in this study of coastally influenced waters, will provide data for future modeling efforts, which will make an important contribution to constraining oceanic N2 fixation inputs."

The development of reactive inks for solar cells is important because of the savings incurred by reducing the total amount of precious silver and also because the outstanding electrical properties these inks have shown can significantly enhance photovoltaic performance while reducing the overall cost of solar energy. <br/><br/>The project will result in a proof-of-concept demonstration that reactive silver inks can replace costly high temperature pastes and low-temperature nanoparticle pastes in solar cell metallization. This reactive silver ink has the following unique features: resistivity comparable to metallic silver, 3.7 micro-ohm-cm, and contact resistances of 1.8 ohm-cm2 on silicon heterojunction cells, even when printed below 90°C. These features enable solar cell field factor (FF) higher than 70% and Power conversion Efficiencies higher than 18%, with much finer control of the finger width and silver consumptions an order of magnitude lower when compared to the state-of-the-art solar cell heterojunction market space.  <br/><br/>This project addresses the following technology gap as it translates from research discovery toward commercial application. The further reduction of the contact resistance to values below 1.2 ohm-cm2 is required to propel solar cell efficiencies above 20%. The project will approach this by optimizing the ink chemistry and developing adhesion promoters. While SiO2 particles could be easily incorporated like traditional silver pastes do to enhance adhesion, these glass frits require high temperatures (>350 deg. C) to form Ohmic contact. The proposed project will look into implementing Sn- and Sn/Pd-based promoters, commonly used in electrochemical and electroless deposition of noble metals on polymers and oxide surfaces. The goal is to print the entire metallization layer, metal plus the adhesion promoter. This reduces capital equipment costs, speeds production, simplifies synthesis, and reduces metal contamination across the cell.<br/><br/>In addition, personnel involved in this project, two graduate students, will receive hands-on experience developing products for commercial applications while working closely with industry partners.  They will also receive technology transfer experience by learning about Phase I SBIR funding opportunities and other entrepreneurial training through the Arizona Technology Transfer Office.<br/><br/>The project engages two important partners: Techniq Inc. (advanced metallization experts) and Simplexity Product Design (printer designers) to allow for pilot testing environment, guided commercialization and the joint development of high throughput, low cost capital equipment."

Biologists have widely documented how plants are influenced by their local environment. Recent findings support the idea that the influence also flows in reverse: where plants grow and how they function can directly modify both local and global scale climate. Yet beyond a few specific examples, researchers have not explored the multiple roles plants play in the climate system. Swann's work to date has demonstrated that changes in where plants grow in the Arctic, mid-latitudes, and tropics can alter local climate and influence atmospheric circulation at global scales, causing changes in patterns of where rains with consequences for plants that live in locations far from the original change. In other words, there can be unanticipated, globally reaching effects from changes in where ecosystems are located and how they respond to changes in their local environment. However, the question remains, could the response of ecosystems alter climate enough to accelerate the Earth system's response to change or create oscillations?  This research will focus on critical unanswered questions about when, where, how, and over what timescale ecosystems change the behavior of Earth in response to big changes including past and future climate change.  Swann will address these questions using a numerical simulation models that range in complexity from primarily conceptual models to full global climate models that include dynamical interactions in ecosystems.  <br/><br/>The scientific community currently lacks an understanding of where and how ecosystems modify the climate system.  Knowing the role that ecosystems play in modifying how the Earth functions is crucial for predicting how climate will change under conditions that are different from today.  Additionally, this research will help to identify the most impactful aspects of ecosystem dynamics and the most sensitive regions on Earth therefore guiding future research into aspects of the Earth system responsible for producing the greatest uncertainty. This project will integrate the scientific themes of Swann's research into teaching and outreach at all levels (K12, undergraduate, and graduate) through formal and informal education providing a strong foundation for career-long integration of research and teaching. The proposal will directly support the development of project-oriented approach in an out-of-school program for middle school girls (still underrepresented minorities in STEM) at the Burke Museum. The joint research and educational efforts aim to engage and inspire students of all ages in better understanding of the interaction between components of the Earth system as well as a greater appreciation for the scientific process itself."

Diffusivities of REE derived from two past studies differ by 3~4 orders of magnitude, which has profound implications for the interpretation of questions such as how fast basaltic magmas ascend from depths in the Earth and planetary interiors and if chemical variations observed in olivine-hosted melt inclusions are reliable records of mantle source heterogeneity. If REE diffusion in olivine is indeed very fast, conclusions derived from recent studies must be re-evaluated. For that reason, the petrology and geochemistry community is interested in clarifying the issue quickly. This EaGER will provide support for the training of a post-doctoral fellow. <br/><br/>The project will integrate theoretical, analytical and experimental approaches to evaluate and determine the source of discrepancy in the two data sets. The team hypothesizes that there is a possibility that two time scales for REE diffusion in olivine may operate under specific conditions. In order to test this hypothesis, the team will conduct a series of laboratory diffusion experiments to evaluate if the presence of major element concentration gradients, differing REE concentrations, and substitutional mechanisms are at the source of the discrepant results from different studies. The experiments will be accompanied by closure temperatures determinations of REE and Ca-Fe-Mg in olivine from natural samples using a new REE-in-olivine-clinopyroxene thermometer, enabling a better comparison of relative diffusion rates between the trivalent and divalent cations in olivine from mafic and ultramafic rocks that experienced different cooling rates. To better understand diffusion measurements from the two laboratories and their connection to observations in natural samples, the team also plans to undertake a theoretical study examining the effects of major element concentration gradient and chemical strain energy on REE diffusion in olivine. The ultimate goal of this EaGER study is not only to resolve the controversy surrounding REE diffusion in olivine, but also to develop a framework for understanding the time scales of diffusion for the trace elements and major elements during multicomponent diffusion in other rock-forming minerals."

The end-products of decomposition serve as nutrients in the soil that, along with water, can be taken up by plants directly through their root systems.  By contrast, deserts and other arid ecosystems have to play by a different set of rules.  The lack of water means that plants are far more patchy in their distribution and grow in brief spurts following rare precipitation events.  Between plant patches, a crust often forms consisting of surface-layer bacteria, fungi, lichens, and mosses.  Soil crust fungi have extensions called hyphae that can make connections between crusted areas and plants.  This project will examine implications of the ""fungal loop hypothesis"", which posits that subsurface fungal hyphae provide a network between plants and soil crusts that conserves and transports water and nutrients to plants.  To test aspects of this hypothesis, researchers on this project will conduct field research at three different sites: the Chihuahuan Desert near El Paso, TX, the Colorado Plateau near Moab, UT, and a site between those, near Albuquerque, NM. At these sites, they will study the movement of water and nutrients through fungal hyphae and develop a framework for understanding when and where the fungal loop is most important. Drylands cover about 40% of Earth's surface and play essential roles in the planet's overall response to environmental change. The multi-site, field-intensive design of this project will also enable research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at two diverse institutions: the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and the University of New Mexico (UNM).<br/><br/>The overall objective of this study is to test the fungal loop hypothesis by studying C and N translocation and retention across representative dryland sites. Using a set of field experiments at three sites, this project will address three questions: (1) How do translocation rates (i.e. transfer of C and N between plants and biocrusts through fungal hyphae) vary among dryland sites, plant species, and biocrust types? (2) Does translocation improve growth, productivity and retention of C and N for plants and biocrusts? (3) Are translocation rates determined by the stoichiometric requirements of plants and biocrusts? The proposed work will generate a predictive framework for when and where translocation of C and N between plants and biocrusts is greatest by examining translocation rates using isotopic tracers in a variety of plant and biocrust functional groups at each site (e.g., C3 vs. C4 grasses) and incorporating seasonal variation, especially to contrast spring and monsoonal growing seasons. The work will also examine the importance of translocation by experimentally severing hyphal connections and measuring the effects on plant and biocrust health as well as retention of C and N in the ecosystem. Finally, to address the mechanism of translocation, the investigators will test the hypothesis that stoichiometric gradients drive C and N movement through fungal hyphae by experimentally manipulating C and N gradients and observing the effects on the horizontal movement of C and N, also with the use of isotopic tracers. This research approach will allow for an unprecedented evaluation of the extent to which fungi are the key regulators of C and N cycling in dryland soils as suggested by the fungal loop hypothesis."

AKI occurs in 5 - 7% of hospitalized patients and results in a mortality rate of about 50%. The financial costs of AKI are estimated to be 8 billion dollars per year, or about $130,000 per life-year saved. It is unlikely that this high mortality and associated cost will be reduced until there are better tools for the early diagnosis of renal injury. This project translates a quartz resonator based thermal biosensor concept into a biomedical instrumentation system for continuous monitoring of kidney function. The project will focus on prototype engineering, instrumentation, and extensive benchmarking with the aim to provide accurate and automated measurements of urine creatinine. Coupled with in-line urine flow, and periodic serum creatinine concentration measurements, a system for near-continuous creatinine clearance measurement in AKI patients will be developed. The unmatched stability, sensitivity, and reproducibility of this system will allow for collection of such data for clinical analysis and early detection of conditions such as sepsis. The sensor design based on enzyme immobilized alginate beads placed in a Kapton® tubing, as an easy to swap disposable cartridge represents a promising clinical diagnostic prototype demonstration with a viable business model.<br/><br/>This project will develop a calorimetric biosensor prototype based upon differential measurement as a way to compensate for background thermal effects. Development of a differential sensor is expected to improve both the sensitivity and the precision of measurement. The reproducibility, accuracy, and stability of the measurement system will be critically evaluated using urine samples. Intra-assay and inter-assay variability will be experimentally determined by repeated measurements and statistical methods. Accuracy will be determined by comparison of the creatinine concentrations determined by HPLC (the gold standard) and the quartz resonator. Agreement between the two methods will be determined by Bland-Altman analysis. Stability of the system will be determined by measuring the creatinine concentration of known creatinine test solutions at regular intervals over a period of 48 hours. The plot of measured concentration vs time will be used to determine the time to failure.

These species affect one another through various types of interactions, including predation, competition, and various types of mutually beneficial relationships. Despite extensive research over the past century, ecologists still find it hard to explain how these interactions influence which species are able to live together in a local community. An overlooked factor may be the history of community assembly -- the order in which species arrive into a newly available habitat. Growing evidence suggests that, indeed, the way species affect one another in communities often depends on the order in which they arrive into the community. Improved knowledge of these historical effects will be useful for solving a range of pressing issues. Examples include environmental challenges such as ecosystem restoration under climate change, agricultural solutions such as biological control against pests that interact with multiple species, and medical problems such as the management of gut microbial communities influencing human health. The researcher will write a book that integrates findings from his work on this topic over the past 15 years. In this book, a new conceptual framework will be developed that can be used to make general predictions about when the order in which species arrive in a local community matters and when it does not.<br/><br/>To achieve a new synthesis in the book, the investigator will integrate four emerging views that replace traditional assumptions about community assembly: (1) the regional pool of species that can potentially colonize newly available local communities should be viewed as dynamic, not static; (2) historical contingency influences not just the structure, but also the functioning of communities; (3) in many cases, communities are in long-lasting transient states that are qualitatively different from their final stable states; and (4) ecological and evolutionary processes operate at the same time scale to influence local population dynamics. The book will be the main broader impact product of this project. A secondary broader impact will be student training. Over the past 6 years, the investigator has designed and taught a new undergraduate course that integrates research and education. In this course, which is taken by about 120 students each year, the investigator uses communities of nectar-inhabiting microorganisms as a study system for inquiry-based education. In addition to being the focus of this teaching, these microbial communities have been the investigator's primary research subject to ask questions about community assembly and historical contingency. Therefore, this research-education integration effort is closely linked to the subject of the book. The opportunity to synthesize current knowledge on community assembly in a broad context will help the investigator to improve and widen the knowledge base that he can use in teaching the course."

UT geoscience faculty are partnering with geoscience faculty at Pellissippi State, Roane State, and Volunteer State Community Colleges in east and middle Tennessee to offer enrichment activities, including outdoor experiential learning and collaborative research that will boost interest in the geosciences as a major and a career.  Enrichment activities include students and faculty from both types of institutions, along with recent geoscience graduates from UT.  These activities are helping community college students develop support networks that can reduce the social barriers that are often encountered when transferring to a large state university. Faculty mentors at UT are advising community college students on transfer courses and connecting them with research and internship opportunities. This project is expected to lead to greater diversity in student populations in 4-year geoscience programs at UT because of the more diverse student body found at the partner community colleges. The colleges typically have higher percentages of first-generation college students, rural students, and African-American students than UT. The project may also lead to greater career success and economic benefits for transfer students, because of the strong demand for professional geoscientists and the relatively high salaries offered for these positions.  The project is expected to serve as a model for other partnerships between major research universities and community colleges; lessons learned are being shared widely to encourage and strengthen similar partnerships at other institutions and in other science, technology, engineering, and math (STEM) disciplines.  <br/><br/>The goals of this model partnership are to: a) increase the number of community college students transferring to geoscience programs (Geology and Physical Geography) at UT; b) improve the rate of success of transfer students at UT, by getting them excited about geoscience education and careers, and providing a higher level of university mentoring prior to their transfer; and c) increase diversity in the 4-year geoscience programs at UT, through effective recruiting from the more diverse pools of students that attend area community colleges. UT faculty are working with their community college partners to recruit students from introductory geology courses during their freshman year. Approximately 15 community college students and 5 UT students are invited to participate with faculty from the partner institutions in a 5-day residential field geoscience workshop at the Great Smoky Mountains Institute at Tremont each summer. The workshop includes experiential learning activities on geoscience topics that are expected to resonate with freshman students, including water quality, fossils, landslides, meteorology, and climate change. Students who are engaged in the summer workshops are invited to participate in additional enrichment activities during their sophomore year. These include field trips to geologically significant sites in the region and visits to UT, where community college students have opportunities to meet peers, tour research labs, and be assigned a faculty mentor.  Mentors provide information on course transfers, scholarships, and career prospects, as well as help arrange research or internship opportunities at UT, at the community colleges, or at other locations, such as Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Through this project, the community colleges are receiving enrichment funds and access to UT labs and equipment for collaborative student research. UT and community college faculty are also working with administrators to improve transfer procedures and methods of tracking success of community college transfer students. The project coincides with ongoing efforts at UT to improve institutional data on metrics of success for transfer students. Faculty participants are guiding this effort to ensure that aggregated institutional data are collected and presented in formats that can be used by departments in planning revisions of curricula and in developing more effective mentoring methods. The efforts to improve the procedures for transfer students, together with the personal and professional ties that are expected to develop between UT and community college faculty members, will ensure that the impact of the project extends beyond the duration of funding and leads to enduring institutional change. Evaluation activities will help build the evidence base regarding what practices are most effective for developing partnerships to improve community college student recruitment, transfer and success in 4-year geoscience programs."

Their chemical reactions in the atmosphere are very similar to those of anthropogenic chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs). While CFCs are well-studied because they consume the ozone in the upper atmosphere that shields the earth from harmful ultraviolet radiation, halomethanes have been largely neglected, even though they currently account for 25% of the ozone depletion.  As anthropogenic CFC levels steadily decline, however, halomethanes are predicted to account for 50% of ozone depletion by 2050.  Based on limited study thus far, marine halomethane production has been ascribed mainly to phytoplankton and macro algae. This project will build on new and compelling data that suggests marine heterotrophic bacteria could also be major producers of halomethanes.  The data produced here will provide the critical evaluation required to address discrepancies in global halomethane budgets which currently are out of balance due to an unknown source to the atmosphere, evaluating the hypothesis that marine heterotrophic bacteria can supply this missing source. Concerns over the stability of the earth's stratospheric ozone layer make this valuable and necessary research with added value of providing support for engaged undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral education at the University of Southern California.<br/><br/>Past research on the production of marine halomethanes has focused on phytoplankton and macro algae, while potential bacterial contributions to the processe have been neglected. This research proposes to study the role of marine heterotrophic bacteria on the production of halomethanes. It has been noted in past studies that there are discrepancies in the global atmospheric halomethane budget, and it is possible this is due to a large missing bacterial source. Additionally, this research will evaluate the potential importance of vitamin B12, methionine, and vanadium cofactors on the synthesis of halomethanes in bacteria. A large portion of marine bacteria cannot synthesize methylation co-enzymes, and therefore, would require available B12, methionine, and vanadium from external sources to complete the methylation step. This study will also measure concentrations of halomethanes, B12, methionine, and vanadium in upwelling regions as well as at a long-term time series site in order to put constraints on the variability of halomethanes concentrations for use in global linked air-sea models."

In much of the nutrient-depleted surface waters of the open ocean, the most successful phytoplankton are tiny photosynthetic bacteria known as Prochlorococcus. These bacteria are highly successful competitors for the ocean's limited nutrients and commonly outcompete larger phytoplankton. Yet, many larger types of phytoplankton persist in the ocean. One reason why this coexistence may occur is that some of the weaker competitors called mixotrophs have evolved a clever alternative strategy best summed up as ""If you can't beat them, eat them"". In addition to directly competing for nutrients dissolved in the water, these larger phytoplankton can acquire nutrients by consuming and digesting their smaller rivals. The dual ability to photosynthesize and eat competitors has clear advantages, but there can be hidden costs of this intraguild predation strategy. While feeding on Procholorococcus, mixotrophs may also inadvertently ingest giant viruses that are so large they are mistaken for food. Infection is often fatal. Mixotrophy and viral infection are ubiquitous in the ocean; however these processes are often understudied and missing from traditional models of marine food webs that generally consider photosynthesis and predation independently. In this project, the interactions among a common mixotroph (Florenciella), its prey (Prochlorococcus), and a virus that infects the mixotroph (FloV1) will be studied in the lab and field. This research will also help guide the development of a cohesive mixotroph-virus-prey trophic model. Improving these trophic models to account for more complex processes could fundamentally change our understanding of marine trophic dynamics. The project will directly support the training of a post-doc, graduate and undergraduate student in inter-disciplinary science that includes field, lab, and modeling activities. The project will support a major component of the graduate student's dissertation and the progressive training of an undergraduate student, culminating in an independent project. The concepts of mixotrophy and viral ecology investigated here will be translated into a public display seen by hundreds of children and members of the public. The PIs will engage a K-12 teacher in the fieldwork at sea through a ""Science Teachers Aboard Research Ships (STARS)"" program and will recruit an undergraduate researcher through the CMORE Scholars program at the University of Hawaii.<br/><br/>The advantages and drawbacks of a mixotrophic strategy will depend on the availability of resources and competitors and the likelihood of viral infection. The timing of grazing will be tested to determine whether Florenciella grazes continuously or separates it grazing and photosynthetic activities by only feeding at night. Prey preferences of Florenciella will be tested in competitive grazing experiments offering Prochlorococcus as prey in the presence of varying amounts of other bacteria and cyanobacteria. Electron microscopy will be used to determine whether prey and virus enter Florenciella by the same pathway and whether the presence of prey competitively interferes with viral infection. The kinetics of grazing by Florenciella and infection of Florenciella by FloV1 will be quantified. The results from these lab experiments will be used to parameterize a numerical model. The model will be used to answer questions and make predictions about the dynamics of the mixotroph-virus-prey system and those predictions will be compared to field data. Collectivity, these observational, experimental and quantitative analyses will provide a detailed exploration of the ecological complexity hidden at the base of the marine food web."

They are also especially vulnerable to human pressures and environmental change. Wetlands contain large reservoirs of soil organic matter, an important source of carbon and nitrogen to estuaries and coastal oceans, but very little is known about the processes involved in the translocation of these nutrients. This project will advance understanding of tidal marsh-estuarine interactions by linking processes between tidal wetland soils and estuaries, and assessing where, when, and how dissolved organic compounds are retained, released and transformed within the marsh soil-estuarine system. Results from this study will be integrated into enhanced monitoring and management efforts through partnerships with the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. The project will improve models that predict the influence of wetlands on estuarine and coastal biology,  geochemistry and pollution response.  In collaboration with the Smithsonian Citizen Science program and teachers from middle schools serving minority students, the team will develop K-12 educational materials.  Specialized training will be extended to undergraduate students, as well as graduate and postdoctoral researchers, with a particular focus on underrepresented groups in science. <br/><br/>This study will test three key research hypotheses that are critical for understanding the role of marsh soils and tidal wetland-estuary margins as buffers, reactors, and transformers of dissolved organic C and N, and that could transform our ability to predict the influence of wetland ecosystems on estuarine biology, biogeochemistry, and ecology. An integrative approach will be used to test hypotheses that combines rich datasets, process-focused experiments, and a novel coupled hydrodynamic-photo-biogeochemical model to investigate three understudied aspects of marsh export that likely control the seasonality and fate of dissolved organic matter in estuaries: (i) soil and porewater organic matter composition, (ii) adsorption-desorption on soil surfaces, and iii) photo- and bio- degradation in estuarine waters. Proposed activities incorporate a system perspective and cover a broad range of marsh environments (i.e., different marsh vegetation characteristics, soil type, surface area and salinity regimes) providing the ability to scale up and assess tidal marsh biogeochemical fluxes and processes across a range of spatial and temporal scales.  Results from this research will increase understanding of the contributions of wetlands and estuarine systems to coastal carbon and nitrogen budgets, and improve predictions of the influences of natural and man-made stresses on ecosystem processes, biogeochemical cycles and exchanges along the continuum of wetlands, estuaries and the coastal zone. This information is highly valuable to managing the coastal zone in the face of accelerated environmental change and continued human pressures and, in particular, to evaluating the potential for managed restoration of wetlands to mitigate climate change impacts."

Development of strategies to manage and conserve tropical forested ecosystems globally depends critically on understanding the mechanisms by which these ecosystems respond to natural and human-induced change. The program will train numerous graduate and undergraduate students, especially members of underrepresented groups, producing a cadre of collaborative, multidisciplinary scientists who can link population, community, and ecosystem approaches to provide a predictive understanding of environmental change. An active schoolyard program develops K-12 curricula in science and mathematics throughout Puerto Rico, including a new 'data jam' workshop in which teachers will use the project's data to investigate basic ecological questions. The program will engage Puerto Rican high school students and teachers in educational programs at the El Verde Field Station. To date, 954 teachers and 1662 students have participated in an interactive teaching website, the Journey to El Yunque. The project collaborates with other large-scale networks including the National Ecological Observatory Network, the Luquillo Critical Zone Observatory, the Cloud Forest Research Coordination Network, and the Forest Global Earth Observatories, strengthening research infrastructure to tackle future challenges. <br/><br/>The Luquillo LTER project will, over the coming three years, explore the development of novel ecosystems resulting from the separate and combined effects of increased drought and hurricane frequencies as these disturbances are mediated by land use legacies. Researchers predict that novel ecosystems resulting from these altered disturbances will differ from previous and current ones both structurally and functionally, and will integrate biogeochemistry, productivity, and population and community ecology studies to understand these differences. Two new experiments will be added to ongoing efforts: a stream drought experiment in which stream flow is reduced by manipulation and a forest through-fall reduction experiment in which rainfall is manipulated. The stream experiment will manipulate stream flow to examine the short- and long-term effects of drought on biota and biogeochemical cycling. The through fall exclusion experiment will determine the impact of multiple short-term droughts on soil biogeochemistry as well as on microbes, seedlings, and litter organisms. Results from both manipulations will be incorporated into models to investigate long-term effects and to evaluate the feasibility of future large scale manipulations that are logistically challenging in the forested ecosystems. A novel canopy trimming experiment will continue to simulate hurricanes in order to examine the effects of changes in hurricane frequencies and to separate the effects of canopy openness from deposition of material to the forest floor on forest composition, soil carbon storage, nutrient dynamics, and forest floor community structure. Results will test the hypothesis that increased frequency of intense hurricanes will increase the dominance of shade intolerant species with cascading effects through other biota and biogeochemistry. This integration of observational and experimental approaches is powerful because the effects of these disturbances over long time periods are poorly understood. The potential to gain insight into the mechanisms whereby these disturbance regimes result in future non-analog ecosystems in tropical forests is high and will significantly advance understanding of ecosystem ecology."

Eutrophication, pollution of surface water supplies through excess nutrients, can result in harmful algal blooms and the degradation of the quality of surface waters throughout the globe.  Thus, the Broader Impacts of the project include helping to reduce the over abundance of nutrients in water supplies, protecting the environment, drinking water, and property values, and optimizing fertilizer use (reducing farming costs and conserving the limited resource phosphate). The education and outreach efforts will include development of a simplified batch-culture-based assay for use in schools and community settings, which will broaden environmental participation and awareness of the need to reduce phosphate waste. In addition, the analytical chemistry and ecology students involved in the project will each receive cross-disciplinary training in the other field.<br/><br/>Improving the technology for measuring phosphate is important because eutrophication (pollution through excess nutrients) is degrading the quality of surface waters throughout the globe, and monitoring of phosphate is largely still limited to laborious lab-based, wet chemistry approaches. The goal of the project is to address this problem by developing a biologically-based phosphate sensor that is continuous, relatively inexpensive, remotely deployable, able to test turbid water, and based on monitoring the growth of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The principle behind the device is that all organisms (including yeast) need phosphate to grow; yeast are ideal organisms for this work for reasons including their robustness to environmental perturbation and resistance to water-borne viruses. Since yeast growth is linear with phosphate concentration in the relevant phosphate concentration range, changes in the amount of bioavailable phosphate in water will be measured by monitoring the growth and respiration of yeast in this continuous culture system under conditions where the test water is the only source of phosphate. Because this sensor will measure bioavailable phosphate, not simply dissolved reactive phosphate (DRP) or total phosphorous (TP) as measured by other standard approaches, it will represent an important new tool for any environmental or engineering studies involving freshwater and should provide insight into previously inaccessible aspects of nutrient dynamics in aquatic systems."

It will lead to a much better understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of existing representations of atmospheric convection in major climate models in the world. As the global climate model grid spacing decreases to ~10 km or less, representing atmospheric convection in such models is a great challenge. The proposed work to use cloud-resolving model simulation of atmospheric convection to evaluate the accuracy and scale-awareness of widely used algorithms for representing convection is innovative, and will pave the way for further improving global climate models. The representation of convection and associated clouds strongly affects the statistics of extreme events in both current and future climates. It is also a major source of uncertainty in climate change projection. Thus, the proposed research will contribute to the simulation and prediction of the occurrence of natural disasters associated with climate variability at different timescales. The project will also contribute to educating future generation climate scientists through training of a postdoctoral researcher and providing learning opportunities for undergraduate summer interns.<br/><br/>The representation of the effects of atmospheric convection is one of the most challenging scientific issues in climate modeling. Over the last few decades, despite tremendous efforts going into improving the treatment of physical processes in climate models, major problems still exist in simulating important climate systems. These deficiencies are largely associated with the lack of accurate representation of atmospheric convection in the models. This project proposes to systematically investigate the criteria used for determining the onset of convection and assumptions that determine the amount of convective activity (known as closure assumptions) in representations of atmospheric convection using a hierarchy of numerical models. The goal is to evaluate the many different ways of representing atmospheric convection in state-of-the-science global climate models, thereby identifying their strengths and weakness and further improving them. To achieve this goal, simulations of atmospheric convection by fine-resolution numerical models that can resolve convection are used to evaluate the onset criteria and closure assumptions for convection. Statistical analysis methods, including skill score calculation, lead-lag correlation, and composite techniques, will be used to analyze the model output data. The simulations of convection will also be used to investigate whether the algorithms of representing convection in current global climate models can still be used when the grid spacing of the models decreases to ~10 km or less, the so-called grey zone scales, from the current spacing of ~100 km or larger. New ideas and formulations for representing convection in global climate models resulting from the analysis will be tested using the Community Atmosphere Model, CAM5."

Yet limited consideration of rule of law exists in studies of the legal integration of religious minorities.  Moreover, popular and scholarly accounts tend to depict the intersection of state law and religious law as highly oppositional and generative of contentious public debate.  To better understand how rule of law might underpin or emerge from legal integration initiatives, this research explores the following questions:  Do legal integration initiatives promote or produce a particular orientation to rule of law? Do they enhance perceptions of rule of law among minority and majority populations or otherwise shape legal consciousness and, in particular, rule of law consciousness? In short, do legal integration initiatives produce more discourse about, more understanding of, and more opportunity for the rule of law?  By building theoretical understanding of the relationship between legal integration and rule of law, the research has the potential to contribute to scholarly and policy discussions of legal integration taking place worldwide.<br/><br/>The research questions that guide this project will be examined through a cross-continental comparative analysis of legal integration initiatives, specifically the role played by family law in the integration of religious minorities. Field-based research (including interviews, discourse analysis, and focus groups) will be used to develop in-depth ethnographic studies of legal integration initiatives in two sites, Malta and Kenya.  The proposed comparative analysis offers a comprehensive treatment of legal integration initiatives through family law, including their dimensions, variance, and effects, and two case studies illuminate these effects in detail, including the experiences of religious minorities.  Anticipated project outputs include 1) scholarly publications and 2) a report on legal integration and family law designed for policy audiences."

The research investigates and exploits the underlying mechanisms of these actions in order to unravel the cellular crosstalk between NO and its derivatives HNO and S-nitrosothiols. Specifically, three directions are pursued. First, the chemistry of NO and HNO with synthetic metal derivatives of macrocyclic and tripodal ligands are utilized to inform the design of next generation fluorescent probes. At the same time, the putative interconversion of NO and HNO in biology is investigated with biomimetic models of copper-zinc (Cu-Zn) superoxide dismutase. Second, metal-based fluorescent sensors for NO and HNO are made ratiometric, reversible, rapid, and near-IR-emitting. These features enable analyte quantitation, dynamic monitoring of signaling events, response rates on the physiological time scale, and deeper tissue imaging, respectively. Third, Cu(II)- or Zn(II)-promoted transnitrosation reactions are explored with the aim of obtaining the first fluorescent sensor for direct detection of S-nitrosothiols in biological media."

The insights gained into interactions in real-world systems fill an important gap in our understanding of interactions, relevant for teaching software design and quality assurance.

They are also especially vulnerable to human pressures and environmental change. Wetlands contain large reservoirs of soil organic matter, an important source of carbon and nitrogen to estuaries and coastal oceans, but very little is known about the processes involved in the translocation of these nutrients. This project will advance understanding of tidal marsh-estuarine interactions by linking processes between tidal wetland soils and estuaries, and assessing where, when, and how dissolved organic compounds are retained, released and transformed within the marsh soil-estuarine system. Results from this study will be integrated into enhanced monitoring and management efforts through partnerships with the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National Estuarine Research Reserve System. The project will improve models that predict the influence of wetlands on estuarine and coastal biology,  geochemistry and pollution response.  In collaboration with the Smithsonian Citizen Science program and teachers from middle schools serving minority students, the team will develop K-12 educational materials.  Specialized training will be extended to undergraduate students, as well as graduate and postdoctoral researchers, with a particular focus on underrepresented groups in science. <br/><br/>This study will test three key research hypotheses that are critical for understanding the role of marsh soils and tidal wetland-estuary margins as buffers, reactors, and transformers of dissolved organic C and N, and that could transform our ability to predict the influence of wetland ecosystems on estuarine biology, biogeochemistry, and ecology. An integrative approach will be used to test hypotheses that combines rich datasets, process-focused experiments, and a novel coupled hydrodynamic-photo-biogeochemical model to investigate three understudied aspects of marsh export that likely control the seasonality and fate of dissolved organic matter in estuaries: (i) soil and porewater organic matter composition, (ii) adsorption-desorption on soil surfaces, and iii) photo- and bio- degradation in estuarine waters. Proposed activities incorporate a system perspective and cover a broad range of marsh environments (i.e., different marsh vegetation characteristics, soil type, surface area and salinity regimes) providing the ability to scale up and assess tidal marsh biogeochemical fluxes and processes across a range of spatial and temporal scales.  Results from this research will increase understanding of the contributions of wetlands and estuarine systems to coastal carbon and nitrogen budgets, and improve predictions of the influences of natural and man-made stresses on ecosystem processes, biogeochemical cycles and exchanges along the continuum of wetlands, estuaries and the coastal zone. This information is highly valuable to managing the coastal zone in the face of accelerated environmental change and continued human pressures and, in particular, to evaluating the potential for managed restoration of wetlands to mitigate climate change impacts."

New fast-frequency tuning high-power microwave sources will enable pulsed electron paramagnetic resonance in the 200 GHz band in combination with high-resolution NMR. Together, these new cryogenic and microwave technologies will yield a boost in the voltage of NMR signals by a factor of >10,000, compared to the random fluctuation of voltage that results in noise.  Such a gain in NMR signal strength will significantly expand the scope of molecular structures that can be studied with NMR, and also drastically shorten the duration of NMR experiments."

It also suggests that some of the first detectable impacts of environmental change may lie in alterations in the ability of organisms to grow and reproduce, rather than just lethality.  This project will develop a framework for looking at the impacts of extreme environmental change on an ecologically and economically important bivalve species, the mussel Mytilus edulis, in the Gulf of Maine, which is warming at an unusually fast rate.  Importantly, our modeling framework is, for the first time, able to account for the interactions of temperature change with the additional stresses that occur in the presence of predators.  These models will therefore not only advance our basic understanding of how multiple stressors affect animals in nature, but also will provide a mechanism for predicting the impacts of environmental change under realistic field conditions that are often ignored by laboratory-only based experiments. The project also will create novel methods for teaching high school students about the impacts of extreme change on their local environments using cutting-edge virtual-reality technology coupled with hands-on experiential learning in the field.<br/><br/>This project seeks to develop a predictive energetics (Dynamic Energy Budget) approach to quantitatively explore the potentially interactive effects of abiotic (temperature) and biotic (risk of predation) stressors on intertidal mussels. The central question that addressed by this project is, how unreliable may predictions of the impacts of environmental change be if a focus is placed only on the isolated rather than combined influence of abiotic or biotic stressors? A framework that considers the effects of environmental change on multiple, interacting species is sorely needed. Building upon an energetics model already parameterized to quantify the effects of temperature and food availability on the mussel Mytilus edulis, this project expands the approach to examine how predation risk - the ""fear of being eaten"" - may alter thermal sensitivity under more realistic field conditions where predators are present. Previous work by this team has shown that the effects of predation risk are comparable to, or exceed those, caused by predicted climate scenarios, but very few attempts have been made to place these risk effects within a bioenergetics framework, especially in marine systems. This proposal capitalizes on the highly complementary approaches of two research groups to develop a predictive framework examining the cumulative effects of abiotic and biotic stressors on growth, maximum size and reproduction of an important ecosystem engineer under realistic field and trophic interaction conditions."

However, not all parts of an organism grow at the same rate, and so changes in access to nutrition during growth can affect the ultimate size of different parts of the body differently.  Although the effects of nutritional variation on relative trait size are well documented, only recently have the tools become available to (i) enable study of how genetic and developmental mechanisms manage the growth of traits to produce a properly proportioned adult and to (ii) enable study of how these mechanisms change to alter growth patterns to produce size diversity among species.  Here, the investigators will take a novel approach by changing diet in lines of fruit flies, each possessing their own unique and known genetic code, to identify the specific genes underlying the regulation and integration of growth among various parts of the body.  This research will be coupled with a new, fun elementary school computer-based learning activity where students will alter the relative growth of structures in virtual creatures, transforming young humans into fantastical beings.<br/><br/>Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a genotype to express different phenotypes across environments.  It is well studied on a phenomenological level, particularly for morphological traits; phenotypic plasticity can hinder or promote adaptation, lead to the genesis of evolutionary novelties or serve as an adaptation itself.  A lack of experimental tools has meant that two components central to the evolution of morphological plasticity - the variation among individuals in the expression of plastic responses and the proximate bases of this variation - are essentially unknown.  Nutritionally-induced size variation is common to all metazoans: nutritional limitation during ontogeny generally produces smaller individuals than does a nutritionally rich diet, although the degree of nutritionally-induced size plasticity can vary dramatically among morphological traits.  Such differences in relative trait plasticity are rooted in recently identified developmental genetic mechanisms that regulate and integrate the growth of traits in response to nutritional variation.  Frankino (PI) and Shingleton (co-PI) hypothesize that variation in these same mechanisms underlies the evolutionarily important variation among genotypes in trait plasticity. Here, they propose to test this hypothesis by:  (i) applying new methods to create and quantify the among-individual variation in nutritionally-induced trait and body size plasticities; (ii) using genome-wide association mapping to identify genes that contribute to this variation, and; (iii) employing a series of developmental assays to confirm the role of these genes in producing among-individual variation in nutritionally induced size plasticity."

Organic nitrates also impact the formation and fate of particulate matter, which affects human health, cloud formation and Earth's surface temperature. To better understand the role organic nitrates play in air quality and climate, new measurements are being made regarding the uptake, multiphase processing, and fate of organic nitrates that contain reactive functionalities and remain reactive in the particle phase.

The organic nitrate yields from the oxidation of multi-olefinic monoterpenes, and the aerosol uptake kinetics of synthetic multifunctional monoterpene organic nitrates are examined as a function of relative humidity and particle acidity using chemical ionization mass spectrometry (CIMS) coupled with a reaction chamber and aerosol flow reactor. In addition, the hydrolysis rates and subsequent aqueous-phase chemical transformations including oligomerization and sulfonation of these organic nitrates are being evaluated. The production and chemistry of gas- and aerosol-phase terpene nitrates in a forested environment are being investigated during two summer field studies. The research contributes broadly to a fundamental understanding of the factors affecting air quality and climate, with respect to: air pollutants and climate forcers, ozone and particulate matter. This work broadly impacts the education of undergraduate and graduate researchers.

The infrastructures assessed can include pipelines, bridges, steel cables, aircrafts, trains, and power plants. Due to the significant complexity and variability of structural health monitoring data, current technology can only reasonably assess limited amounts of information. Yet, as structural health monitoring expands to more complex problems and its data includes hundreds of terabytes of structural data over several decades, big data strategies become essential. This award supports fundamental research to integrate statistical, big data strategies with structural health monitoring systems. The new, integrated framework will enable the tracking and the anticipation of structural damage in harsh, highly variable environments over many years. This study will provide tools for the detection of structural damage before catastrophic failures occur. Results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society by improving safety and reducing life-cycle costs of many civil and mechanical systems, from airplanes to bridges to pipelines. The research also promotes highly interdisciplinary collaboration as the research employs methods and solves problems found across the disciplines of electrical and computer engineering, computer science, mechanical engineering, and civil engineering. This diverse subject matter will promote a multidisciplinary engineering education and help to recruit and broaden the participation of underrepresented students in research.<br/><br/>This project will statistically identify barely visible, critically important trends in large (gigabyte to terabyte size) structural health monitoring data sets.

This project addresses these three challenges through the creation of a modular big data structural health monitoring framework based on dynamic time warping, singular value decomposition, factor analysis, and maximum likelihood statistics. The big data structural health monitoring framework is assessed through several short-term (hours to days) and long-term (multi-year) structural health monitoring experiments that introduce composite panels to a variety of damage and environmental conditions. These experiments provide statistical validation as well as a unique opportunity to study the effects of environmental parameters on composite structural health monitoring data."

Transition-metal carbides are a technologically important class of materials that are extremely hard, can withstand high-temperatures, and exhibit excellent resistance to wear, ablation, and corrosion. As a result, these materials are attractive for building hypersonic vehicles, spacecrafts, cutting tools, etc. However, they are generally believed to break easily at room temperature.  The new knowledge gained from these studies can help develop superior performance, long-lasting, sustainable structural materials for use in a wider variety of applications. Therefore, the results of this research and the educational training of next-generation scientists and engineers will benefit the U.S. economy and society. <br/><br/>Transition-metal carbides, owing to a mixture of ionic, covalent, and metallic bonding, are expected to be intrinsically ductile even though they are generally considered to be brittle at room temperature. Motivated by the recent nanomechanical tests revealing ductility in single-crystals of these compounds, this project aims to develop fundamental understanding of the factors contributing to plasticity vs. fracture in these materials. To this purpose, a combination of in-situ electron microscopy based mechanical characterization and multi-scale modeling will be conducted at length scales between 0.1 and 3 micrometers. A new modeling framework, called the Discrete Dislocation & Crack Dynamics will be developed and has the potential for predicting concurrent plastic deformation and crack propagation in these materials. The research plans to reveal the role of crystal orientation, specimen size, transition-metal (group IV vs. V), and loading mode (tension, compression, and indentation) in determining dislocation microstructures, onset of fracture, and failure. These studies will improve the fundamental understanding of the physics of plastic deformation in transition-metal carbides and can likely enhance the life-time operation of advanced structural components used, for example, in aerospace and automotive industries, cutting tools, and hard coatings and may potentially lead to the design of tougher miniature structural components, such as micro- and nano-electromechanical systems."

In the course of this project, the principal investigator and professional engineers will interact with at least a dozen engineering students, and they will interact with biologists and professional engineers in designing and producing devices that will be applied immediately to answer real-world questions about wildlife biology and conservation.

Proposed improvements in tag design and antenna placement should dramatically decrease problems for birds wearing the tags, and the proposed information infrastructure that will follow the tags from programming to deployment should make the tag id data highly functional and reliable for all users. This tag has the potential to revolutionize the real-time monitoring of bird migration and the study of dispersal. The proposed DTT would decline to as little as 1 g in mass, and, though it will be optimized to collect solar geolocation data at first, the same platform could be used for an extremely broad array of sensing applications in an open-ended Lab-on-a-Bird platform.

This irritation is referred to as acridity. Acridity has been reported in Kiwi fruit, a number of palms and ornamental plants (such as Dieffenbachia, daffodils, hyacinths and other bulb plants) and pose health risks to harvesters, children and pets. All the edible Aroids, including taro or dasheen, are acrid to varying degrees. Aroids such as taro's nutritious corm are eaten as a staple and the leaves as a vegetable by more than half a billion people. The cause of acridity is unknown.  The current assay for acridity is to eat a small sample or rub a raw corm on the forearm of a test subject. More often than not, the test leads to the rapid withdrawal of test subjects from the study. The goals of this project are to determine the cause of acridity in taro so that potentially rapid breeding selection tool(s) can be developed to test for acridity.  A viable solution to the acidity bottleneck would contribute to better food availability and new value-added products.   <br/><br/>This project is at the exploratory stage and could transform the molecular understanding of acridity, an anti-nutritional property of taro and other aroids. The common belief is that acridity is caused by sharp barbed needle-like calcium oxalate crystals (raphides). However, the fact that purified acrid raphides can be inactivated by proteinase with no change in raphide morphology suggests that proteins on the raphides cause acridity in an allergy type reaction. At least twenty-eight proteins are found on purified raphides. The goal of this project is to identify and validate which of these raphide-associated proteins are responsible for acridity in taro. Once identified, the protein(s) will be sequenced and predicted allergy-causing sequences will be further identified by sequencing. The sequences will then be used to develop a molecular assay for validating and associating the presence of the proteins with differences in acridity between taro varieties from Africa, Asian and Oceania. This project will be the first in-depth study to solving this major breeding bottleneck to improve the quality of taro, a traditional but neglected crop, and increase crop diversity and thereby increase the market opportunities' for small-farmers and rural households. Acridity data will be integrated into the European Union's Innovation & Networks Executive Agency (INEA) funded project on taro.  Advanced training in biotechnology will be given and technology shared and coordinated with existing projects."

To do both of these things they will (i) conduct household surveys to elicit network data, attitudes, and political utilization; (ii) match the survey data to past political reservation assignment rules to study how beliefs and social network structure change in response to constitutional provisions to protect the most disadvantaged groups; (iii) conduct experiments to study the impact of network change on the willingness of members of one group to pass information to members of the other group. <br/> <br/>The PIs will study the effect of political reservation on the structure of social and economic networks. Reservation of disfranchised members and women to positions of leadership could affect the network in several ways. Reservation can affect attitudes, either positively or negatively, and influence the resources the reserved group has access to when a member of its community is in a position of leadership. Each of these forces can affect the incentives or willingness to maintain, form or cut links across groups, which may then have effects on the overall structure of the social network. Further, since the social network is the surface on which other processes, such as social learning, takes place, the way affirmative action affects the network structure could have far-reaching implications, influencing how well individuals learn about new opportunities such as jobs.<br/> <br/>The PIs plan on developing and estimating a simple model of network formation.

The vast majority of woody plant species - especially in the most diverse forests - depend on fruit-eating birds to disperse their seeds, but information on the factors governing fruit choice and seed dispersal at a community level is lacking. This project will address this shortcoming through observations and experiments across the Americas.  The overarching goal of the research is to test the hypothesis that fruit-eating birds of different sizes and classes increase dispersal rates for plant species that are proportionally rare in the environment. Achieving a better understanding of seed dispersal by birds is critically important to advancing ecology, since plant populations depend on seed dispersal to regenerate, coexist, colonize new areas, shift geographic ranges, and cope with climatic and other environmental changes. Beyond advancing basic science, the knowledge generated by this research will have positive implications for forestry, natural resource management, restoration ecology, and conservation. The activities will result in the training of graduate and undergraduate students, and broaden the education and participation of minorities in the sciences while fostering international collaboration and exchanges between researchers and students from the USA, Peru, and Argentina. <br/><br/>Existing theory and empirical work suggest that equalizing and stabilizing mechanisms involving negative density-dependence (NDD) play key roles in the maintenance of species diversity by conferring advantages to species that are relatively rare in communities. This project will study a little known class of NDD process that, if proven to be of widespread occurrence, can be important for diversity maintenance and the structuring of plant-frugivore mutualistic communities: antiapostatic frugivory and seed dispersal. Antiapostatic frugivory would result in disproportionately high seed dispersal when species' fruits are relatively rare in communities of plants that share frugivorous seed dispersal agents such as birds. To examine the generality of antiapostatic frugivory, this research will conduct field studies in four continental localities representing four distinct plant-frugivore communities. These communities provide fully independent biotic and abiotic elements in which to test occurrence and magnitude of antiapostatic frugivory as they are located across a latitudinal gradient: from eastern North America (Pennsylvania) to southern South America (Patagonia), including two Peruvian forest sites (lowland Amazonian rainforest at Madre de Dios, and an Andean cloud forest at Abra Patricia). In addition to observations of fruit consumption and plant demography, controlled fruit-selection experiments using natural and artificial fruit displays will be conducted."

Submarine landslides pose a significant socio-economic hazard, not only because they may destabilize offshore installations (e.g. underwater cables), but more significantly because the tsunamis generated by such slope failures have caused significant human fatalities and destruction of coastal infrastructure. The Hikurangi margin off New Zealand is ideally suited to study the various processes known to act as drivers/preconditioners for slope failure.  The project will assess the importance of many factors on slope stability including gas hydrates and sediment composition and diagenesis (e.g., what makes a particular sedimentary layer weak); tectonic stress and geometry (e.g., slope steepening); and margin hydrogeology (e.g., transient pore pressure changes associated with climate and faulting). The geochemical component of this project complements a large, international, multi-year German-led project termed Slide Activity on the Hikurangi Margin, New Zealand (SLAMZ).  Results from this study will serve to test various current ideas on the role of gas hydrate on slope stability, and will also address issues such as the water and carbon budgets along the margin and the presence and extent of fluid flow within the sediments.  The results will thus have a broader relevance in the context of our understanding of the hydrogeology, element cycling, and earthquake generation in subduction zones worldwide. The project includes the training of an undergraduate student as well as mentoring of a postdoctoral investigator.<br/><br/>Submarine slope failure is a major sedimentary process along ocean margins worldwide, with consequences that include margin architecture, hydrogeology and tsunamogenesis. Numerous studies have proposed that gas hydrates play a major role in controlling slope failure initiation and mass-movement processes, including a new hypothesis that postulates that gas hydrate itself may lead to seafloor weakening through plastic, very slow (creeping) deformation similar to rock glaciers in the terrestrial environment. In contrast to the extensive geophysical and near-seafloor data sets available for the Hikurangi margin, there is a lack of deep core geochemical data to address the interdependence of fluid, temperature, and gas hydrate dynamics in slope stability. This project aims at generating the first data set on geochemical parameters that complements ongoing geophysical, petrophysical and modeling efforts to unravel the role of gas hydrate in slope stability of the Hikurangi Margin in a partnership with scientists from Germany and New Zealand. The SLAMZ program (led by the University of Bremen) will use a seafloor to sample sediment at eight locations with contrasting tectonic settings and geometries, depth of gas hydrate stability, slump characteristics and fluid flow. The geochemical component of this large international project will generate and analyze pore fluid data that are key to: 1) Establish distribution and concentration of gas hydrate; 2) Evaluate postulated changes in gas hydrate stability associated with seamount subduction; 3) Constrain transients associated with gas hydrate and sediment slumping processes; and 4) Detect and characterize the nature and sources of fluid flow. Our results will contribute to our understanding of the geochemical, and geomechanical transformations in gas-hydrate bearing subduction zones, with implications to the societally-relevant processes that contribute to slope instability."

This is especially true of large, high value fishes that are vulnerable to overfishing because of their biology. For example, one third of shark and ray species are known to have declined in recent history, but it is unknown whether most of the remaining two-thirds are also declining, or if they are stable. Likewise, population sizes of predatory fishes such as groupers and tuna have decreased substantially due to intense fishing, yet little is known about the extent of decline and risk of extinction for some of these species. This project uses the evolutionary history of well-studied related species to provide estimates of basic demographic properties of little-studied species of fisheries and conservation importance. This knowledge provides important information to guide management efforts, such as limits on catch and trade, until more direct research can be carried out. The researchers will also engage in educational outreach on mathematical biology for undergraduates and on marine biodiversity science for the general public. <br/><br/>Scientists often have some knowledge of individual traits such as reproductive behavior, lifespan, and metabolic rates of many related fish species, even in the absence of population-level information. Evolutionary theory can predict the co-evolution of these unique trait combinations of various groups. This theory can be used to infer demographic rates and project species' status, but previous efforts have not incorporated the unique details of each species' biology. This project will develop comprehensive theory linking the evolution of these traits to species status projections for tunas, groupers, and sharks and rays. Modern statistical methods will allow information from models of data-rich species, which have formal assessments, to be shared with poorly studied species in similar habitats, or with relatives. With this new understanding of population trajectories, the team will produce recommendations for use by organizations like the International Union for Conservation of Nature, as well as managers and scientists."

Subduction zones are where two tectonic plates collide and one sinks below the other.  Subduction zones produce the largest earthquakes in the world, such as the magnitude 9.0 Tohoku earthquake of 2011 that caused widespread destruction in northern Japan.  This project will focus on two subduction zone regions: Cascadia in the U.S. and Hikurangi in New Zealand. Onshore and offshore GPS data will be modeled to determine the amount of slip released as slow slip events, as steady creep, or where regions are locked and not slipping. Slow slip events refer to slip on a fault that is similar to what occurs during an earthquake, but occurs much more slowly and does not emit damaging seismic waves. Locked regions refer to areas of a fault in which friction prevents slip, allowing energy to build up for future release in an earthquake. In contrast to previous modeling work, this project will use realistic, three-dimensional elastic properties of the earth constrained by prior seismic studies. The products of this project will directly inform earthquake hazard forecasts for both the Cascadia and Hikurangi subduction zones, which have major cities nearby (Portland and Seattle in Cascadia; Wellington in Hikurangi). Important additional information will be obtained for an International Ocean Discovery Program project scheduled for the northern Hikurangi margin in 2018 that is targeting the slow slip region. The project will support and train an early career female scientist who will be mentored by a more established female scientist.  The project also features public outreach through public talks in New Zealand and the U.S. and the incorporation of the results into lecture materials at two universities in the U.S.<br/><br/>This project will generate new and improved catalogs of slow slip events and plate locking models for the Cascadia and Hikurangi (New Zealand) subduction zones. A Network Inversion Filter (NIF) technique will be used to process all available GPS data to identify slow slip events, and produce models of slip and slip-rate evolution over time.  The NIF technique is based on a Kalman filter approach, which balances a physically reasonable but inaccurate model of steady slip with noisy data.  Additionally, these NIF inversions will incorporate offshore ocean bottom pressure (OBP) data from the Hikurangi Ocean Bottom Investigation of Tremor and Slow Slip deployment during the mid-2014 to mid-2015 time period for the Hikurangi subduction zone.  These OBP instruments recorded a large offshore slow slip event in late 2014. These models include, for the first time, realistic, three-dimensional earth structure and the effects topography and bathymetry.  Long-term velocities of GPS stations will be modeled to obtain improved constraints on the plate interface locking region for each subduction zone. Plate locking indicates how much of the expected motion between tectonic plates is not occurring continuously at the boundary, and could therefore be released in earthquakes or slow slip events. GPS station velocities will be averaged in two ways: first only over times between slow slip events and second by averaging through slow slip events which will provide two locking models for each subduction zone.  Products will include new realistic 3D locking models for the two regions, slow-slip event catalogs for both subduction zones and a full-slip budget with uncertainties for each subduction zone as a function of location over the time period of study."

To empirically test the prediction of such a theory, one needs to recover valuations of the players. Most econometric methods used to recover valuations rely on the assumption that the game is at a stable equilibrium (known as a Nash equilibrium). It is not surprising that such a framework provides a poor fit to the data in changing or new markets. At the same time, there is a growing theoretical literature in algorithmic game theory that allows one to study games where the game is not at a stable equilibrium. The PIs? program focuses on developing a methodology for inference without relying on the standard notions of the stability of outcomes in dynamically changing environments, such as online auctions. The goal of this project is to develop a theory that allows the researchers to take advantage of new dynamic data sets from electronic markets available on the Internet, and using the findings from the data to further the underlying theory.<br/> <br/>The results of the project are intended to enable to application and development of Data Science tools for analysis and prediction in  non-stable and new market settings.

The project is aimed at combining the insights from algorithmic game theory with econometric methods to enable the analysis of dynamic markets. The intellectual merit of the project is twofold: (i) providing a methodology for inference in games (i.e., estimation of the payoff functions of players and the distribution of player types) in cases where the players use general classes of learning strategies; (ii) providing tools for the analysis of outcomes in non-equilibrium environments, including the analysis of statistical properties of the outcomes constructed using inferred preferences and types."

Despite their natural and economic importance, developing a fuller understanding of large river processes has been difficult because of the physical and mechanistic complexities of such processes.  This doctoral dissertation research project will use innovative methods that include the integration of remotely sensed data with hydrogeomorphologic data to advance basic understanding of sediment distribution patterns in the complex fluvial environments associated with large rivers.  The project will provide new insights into the morphodynamics of large rivers by characterizing the spatiotemporal patterns of sediment transport and identifying the hydrosedimentary interactions in channel floodplain systems.  Project results will be useful for addressing a broad range of water resources management issues, wetlands preservation ecology problems, and local policy-making questions.  The project also will strengthen institutional ties between U.S. and Brazilian universities and scientific centers, and it will incorporate educational outreach to local U.S. schools for support of underrepresented K-12 students in the science.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>Because sediment plays a major role in the hydrophysical, ecological, and biogeochemical functions of any channel-floodplain system, the assessment of sediment transport and mapping of sedimentary environments over multi-temporal scales have been areas of focus for river scientists across multiple disciplines.  The doctoral student whose dissertation research will be supported by this award will focus on two core questions:  (1) What are the spatiotemporal patterns of sediment transport at major confluences along an anabranching main river channel?  (2) What are the sediment transport, deposition patterns, and sediment budgets in the floodplains?  The student will answer these questions by conducting field surveys, geomorphic mapping, and in-situ sample collection at several sites along the Amazon River.  He will integrate these field data with remote sensing-derived products to model and characterize the macroscale sediment transport mechanisms in the channel-floodplain systems of the river.  Outcomes from this research project would be useful to a global understanding of riverine anabranching patterns as well as shedding new light on the morphodynamics and environmental mechanisms of large river systems around the world."

However, not all parts of an organism grow at the same rate, and so changes in access to nutrition during growth can affect the ultimate size of different parts of the body differently.  Although the effects of nutritional variation on relative trait size are well documented, only recently have the tools become available to (i) enable study of how genetic and developmental mechanisms manage the growth of traits to produce a properly proportioned adult and to (ii) enable study of how these mechanisms change to alter growth patterns to produce size diversity among species.  Here, the investigators will take a novel approach by changing diet in lines of fruit flies, each possessing their own unique and known genetic code, to identify the specific genes underlying the regulation and integration of growth among various parts of the body.  This research will be coupled with a new, fun elementary school computer-based learning activity where students will alter the relative growth of structures in virtual creatures, transforming young humans into fantastical beings.<br/><br/>Phenotypic plasticity is the ability of a genotype to express different phenotypes across environments.  It is well studied on a phenomenological level, particularly for morphological traits; phenotypic plasticity can hinder or promote adaptation, lead to the genesis of evolutionary novelties or serve as an adaptation itself.  A lack of experimental tools has meant that two components central to the evolution of morphological plasticity - the variation among individuals in the expression of plastic responses and the proximate bases of this variation - are essentially unknown.  Nutritionally-induced size variation is common to all metazoans: nutritional limitation during ontogeny generally produces smaller individuals than does a nutritionally rich diet, although the degree of nutritionally-induced size plasticity can vary dramatically among morphological traits.  Such differences in relative trait plasticity are rooted in recently identified developmental genetic mechanisms that regulate and integrate the growth of traits in response to nutritional variation.  Frankino (PI) and Shingleton (co-PI) hypothesize that variation in these same mechanisms underlies the evolutionarily important variation among genotypes in trait plasticity. Here, they propose to test this hypothesis by:  (i) applying new methods to create and quantify the among-individual variation in nutritionally-induced trait and body size plasticities; (ii) using genome-wide association mapping to identify genes that contribute to this variation, and; (iii) employing a series of developmental assays to confirm the role of these genes in producing among-individual variation in nutritionally induced size plasticity."

Dehydration refers to the opposite reaction that releases CO2 gas. By entering into important reactions and serving to control pH, these species govern a wide variety of chemical and biological processes in the ocean. Surprisingly, while the important reactions that involve CO2 hydration and its resulting products have been extensively studied in the ocean, some of the fundamental mechanisms remain poorly understood and datasets are sparse. In particular, almost nothing is known about how the natural isotopes of the carbon and oxygen atoms are involved and this is critically needed to explain observed changes in chemical species and solid calcium carbonate such as that created by coral reefs.  This research aims to carefully produce novel experimental data that includes critical measurements of carbon and oxygen isotopes before and after the hydration of CO2 in the ocean. Because these resulting carbonate species are used widely in many studies in the ocean sciences, particularly those examining past climates, this research will have far-reaching influences. Additionally, the results will provide new fundamental insight on exactly how the ocean will take up and respond to changing concentrations of atmospheric CO2 in a changing climate. The research will fund an early-career scientist who is dedicated to graduate and undergraduate education as well as scientific outreach to the community. <br/><br/>While hydration/dehydration of CO2 in the ocean critically influences a variety of marine chemical and biological processes, there are certain aspects of the reaction that are poorly understood. The molecular mechanism is not yet clear, as there are two possible pathways that have been proposed. Additionally, kinetic isotope effects during CO2 have not been well studied, and the data regarding this topic is inconsistent. This research aims to study the carbon and oxygen isotope fractionation, which will not only clarify the molecular mechanism of the reaction but also will add a consistent dataset on kinetic isotope effects. The main challenge in this study is separating the product, HCO3-, from CO2 before re-equilibration, but the researcher will resolve this by rapidly precipitating dissolved carbon as carbonate. Since carbonates formed from the process of hydration are considered critical indicators of water chemistry, biological processes, and the inorganic carbon cycle as a whole and are used in a wide variety of oceanographic research, particularly as paleo-proxies, this research will provide fundamental mechanistic data that will greatly advance studies reaching beyond the physical chemical measurements that will be made here."

The findings will help test theories of life-history evolution, and provide developmental and functional insights into limitations on recruitment in marine fisheries. The size of individuals spans many orders of magnitude, but is constrained at the large and small extremes by principles of physics. As organisms become smaller, the world surrounding them becomes more resistive to their movements, which are thought to limit the size of fish offspring to no smaller than 4.5 mm. At this size, fish larvae experience difficulty feeding. Alternatively, size at birth is also related to the time it takes to reach maturity. This project will test these alternatives using guppies as a model system. The project incorporates undergraduate mentoring and research training. Additionally, the project will utilize the guppy as a model for the teaching of evolution and ecology within local high school classrooms. <br/><br/>This project involves two miniaturization manipulations: hydrodynamic and developmental. In the first manipulation, the researchers will increase the viscosity of water using dextran, thereby effectively miniaturizing the offspring in size, but not development. In the second manipulation, the researchers will remove yolk from the eggs of developing embryos, thereby miniaturizing and prematurely delivering the young. Because guppies are live bearing, the yolk manipulation requires culturing guppy embryos in vitro in order to access the yolk sac. With a pulled capillary tube, yolk will be removed such that guppy embryos will be forced to feed exogenously at  approximately 4.4 mm. Feeding rates will be compared between the hydrodynamic and developmental manipulations to determine if size or maturity is the limiting feature when feeding on suspended food items. Feeding trials will be filmed using high-speed video to measure jaw kinematics and determine the Reynolds number under which the feeding apparatus is operating during suction feeding."

When these species inflict damage on human resources, their population ""explosions"" become a practical concern. It is often difficult to study populations when they are very small because individuals are so rare and hard to find. Yet, understanding what keeps a species rare and what happens to shift populations into periods of rapid growth is important for predicting and controlling outbreaks of many kinds. This research examines possible reasons for dramatic cycles of abundance in the aspen leaf miner, a tiny species of moth that is usually rare but can outbreak and cause extensive damage to aspen trees. In particular, investigators will test whether females in small populations are unable to mate as often and lay as many eggs as females in large populations.  If confirmed, low mating success in small populations may be important in controlling other forest pests and slowing the spread of invasive species. <br/><br/>Due to its high level of polyandry and sustained low and high population phases, the aspen leaf miner (Phyllocnistis populiella) feeding on quaking aspen (Populus tremuloides) provides an excellent system for exploring potential demographic impacts of mate-finding Allee effects on large amplitude population fluctuations. This project will use a combination of experimental and observational approaches to address whether mate-finding Allee effects and polyandry contribute to sustaining low phases of the aspen leaf miner. Specifically it will employ: 1) mating experiments to examine whether multiple mating increases female fecundity, and 2) observational studies across populations with varying densities to address whether potential and realized polyandry increases with population density. A better understanding of the mechanisms keeping populations at low density or releasing them into growth phases will aid predictions of where and when outbreaks are likely to occur."

This is especially true of large, high value fishes that are vulnerable to overfishing because of their biology. For example, one third of shark and ray species are known to have declined in recent history, but it is unknown whether most of the remaining two-thirds are also declining, or if they are stable. Likewise, population sizes of predatory fishes such as groupers and tuna have decreased substantially due to intense fishing, yet little is known about the extent of decline and risk of extinction for some of these species. This project uses the evolutionary history of well-studied related species to provide estimates of basic demographic properties of little-studied species of fisheries and conservation importance. This knowledge provides important information to guide management efforts, such as limits on catch and trade, until more direct research can be carried out. The researchers will also engage in educational outreach on mathematical biology for undergraduates and on marine biodiversity science for the general public. <br/><br/>Scientists often have some knowledge of individual traits such as reproductive behavior, lifespan, and metabolic rates of many related fish species, even in the absence of population-level information. Evolutionary theory can predict the co-evolution of these unique trait combinations of various groups.

This project will develop comprehensive theory linking the evolution of these traits to species status projections for tunas, groupers, and sharks and rays. Modern statistical methods will allow information from models of data-rich species, which have formal assessments, to be shared with poorly studied species in similar habitats, or with relatives. With this new understanding of population trajectories, the team will produce recommendations for use by organizations like the International Union for Conservation of Nature, as well as managers and scientists."

However, such guarantees are hard to provide, since humans may misunderstand the automation's intentions or behave in an unanticipated manner; tragic examples like the crash of Air France flight 447 illustrate that such confusion between pilots and autopilots can lead to catastrophic outcomes.  Although some applications may someday yield to full automation (e.g., cars can already drive themselves in traffic), legal and ethical concerns related to safety, accountability, and non-repudiation will ensure humans and autonomy must be capable of handing off control authority at multiple levels in many such systems for the foreseeable future.  The principal investigator (PI) proposes to flexibly deploy degrees of autonomy in the presence of human collaborators to compensate for changes in task or environmental conditions.

Gene editing can produce desired traits in crops, but the current process for gene editing in corn is technically challenging with limited throughput. This project will explore methods to more efficiently induce DNA variants at specific sites in the corn genome. The research will test whether short-term delivery of gene editing enzymes to corn stem cells will cause DNA variants that can be inherited from the treated plant to the next generation. If successful, the project will develop a new tool for genome research and corn breeding that is expected to have a high impact on understanding gene function and developing more productive corn varieties.

This project will investigate whether transient expression of the Cas9 endonuclease and a synthetic, single guide RNA (gRNA) in shoot apical meristem cells can produce inheritable gene edits. The central hypothesis is that transient expression of Cas9 and gRNA in plant stem cells will induce mutant sectors large enough to contribute to the gametes. If successful, transient mutagenesis will produce targeted mutations without tissue culture or the generation of a transgenic organism.

Each one of us has a unique voiceprint - an essential part of our self-identity. Though the quality of text-to-speech technology has improved, voice options remain limited. For the 2.5 million Americans (and tens of millions worldwide) living with voicelessness who rely on devices to talk, access to a custom digital voice is a game changer. It's the difference between a functional solution and being heard, uniquely, as oneself. Enhanced opportunities for social connection increase quality of life, independence, and access to educational and vocational resources that can narrow the gap between those with and without disability. This immediate unmet societal need, coupled with the increasing proliferation of devices that speak to us and for us, creates a compelling, timely and significant commercial opportunity for high quality, personalized digital voices that can be produced at scale. By leveraging the company's crowdsourced human voicebank and proprietary voice matching and blending algorithms the technology has the potential to empower everyone to express themselves through their own voice.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project builds on the company's NSF-funded research and Phase I results that support feasibility and commercialization of a customized voice building technology. The text-to-speech market, encompassing assistive technologies, enterprise and consumer applications, is currently valued at around $1B and is rapidly growing and ripe for innovation. To create custom voices, the company leverages the source-filter theory of speech production. From those who are unable or unwilling to record several hours of speech the company extracts a brief vocal sample - even a single vowel contains enough 'vocal DNA' to seed the personalization process. Identity cues of the source are then combined with filter properties of a demographically and acoustically matched donor in the company's voicebank. The result is a voice that captures the vocal identity of the recipient but the clarity of the donor. Phase II technical objectives address the need for 1) customer-driven voice customization, 2) quality assurance of crowdsourced recordings, 3) voice aging algorithms, and 4) targeted donor recruitment algorithms. These advances will help secure the assistive technology beachhead and spur innovations for broader applications such as virtual reality, personal robotics, and digital persona for the Internet of Things."

Mechanism design innovation involves the selection of an appropriate mechanism type (i.e., the number of moving pieces and joints as well as the pattern of their interconnections) and the determination of key dimensions in the mechanism needed to generate the desired motions. Once a mechanism type is selected, the appropriate dimensions can often be determined by solving a system of polynomial equations. The task of type selection, however, is not so amenable to mathematical treatment, and requires a level of intuition that may take many years to develop and is difficult to pass on.  This award supports the development of a set of web-based, data-driven design tools that unify the type and dimensional synthesis for mechanism design innovation. The planned MOOC (massive open online course) will help bring these tools to the masses and help promote interest in science and engineering including high school students and those from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>The research team will bring together the diverse fields of reverse engineering, computational shape analysis, and design kinematics to develop a data-driven paradigm for kinematic synthesis of mechanical motion generation devices. The goal is to advance the science of mechanism design and lead to practical and efficient design tools capable of solving highly complex motion generation problems faced by machine designers. Central to this research is the creation of a new computational framework for simultaneous type and dimensional synthesis of various mechanisms. This includes (1) the development of unified versions of design equations that span broad classes of mechanisms; (2) the development of unified algorithms for data-driven simultaneous type and dimensional synthesis of planar, spherical and spatial mechanisms, and (3) the creation of a mechanism design portal, which will allow users to design, store, search, compare, and analyze mechanisms."

This subject is central to modern mathematics and has a rich history stretching back more than a century. TOPOSYM is a series of international topology conferences held in Prague, Czech Republic, in a five- year cycle since 1961. The conference has long served as a geographic and intellectual meeting point. On one hand it has a large attendance both from North America (and the US in particular) and from Europe (and Eastern Europe in particular). On the other, a large cross section of the more analytical side of topology is represented at the meeting. The Twelfth Symposium on General Topology (TOPOSYM 2016) will be held July 25-29, 2016 in Prague, Czech Republic, under the auspices of the Institute of Mathematics of the Czech Academy of Sciences and the Faculty of Mathematics and Physics of the Charles University. This grant will support the US based participants who attend the symposium.<br/><br/>The conference covers a broad range of topics on the more analytical side of topology:  general and set-theoretic topology, descriptive set theory, continuum theory, topological dynamics, topology in functional analysis and algebra, and categorical topology. The conference will contain invited lectures by many leaders in the field of general and set-theoretic topology: A. Arhangel'skii, L. Aurichi, D. Dikranjan, A. Dow, M. Hrusak, O. Kalenda, A. Kechris, P. Koszmider, M. Krupski, W. Kubis, A. Kwiatkowska, J. Lopez-Abad, V. Martinez de la Vega, J. Melleray, J. van Mill, A. Miller, J. Moore, C. Mouron, L. Nguyen Van The, L. Oversteegen, C.

Many high altitude animals survive through winter underneath snow that buffers them from extremes of temperature. Many unique and ecologically important animals live in mountainous environments, making it vital to understand and predict impacts of annual differences in snow cover on their population abundances, but as yet we have limited understanding of how snow impacts survival and reproduction of insects and other animals. This project proposes to study physiological and genetic responses to variation in snow cover in a high altitude beetle in the laboratory and the natural environment to understand how snow alters reproductive success during the winter and subsequent summer.  This work will develop a partnership between UC-Berkeley and two Primarily Undergraduate Institutions. Undergraduates at the Primarily Undergraduate Institutions will work with researchers from Berkeley, and Berkeley PhD students will supervise undergraduates from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences. Thus both groups of students will be exposed to the culture of different educational institutions and will have access to professional contacts outside their usual network. A curriculum module developed from the project for K-12 students will be used to contribute towards their understanding of challenges that organisms face in snowy climates, and this module will be distributed to K-12 teachers through a UC Berkeley-based website.<br/><br/>For high altitude animals, summer is a time of energy gain, while energy conservation is key during winter because resources are scarce and animals rely on energy stores. To resist winter cold, high altitude insects use energy stores to synthesize metabolically expensive cryoprotectants. This may generate a trade-off between cold hardiness and energy conservation. Snow buffers thermal fluctuations, decreasing cold mortality and need for cold hardiness.  However, since temperatures are greater beneath snow than in a snow-free, exposed habitat, there may be increased overall energy demand associated with living under snow.  Due to the energetic trade-off, inter-annual fluctuations in winter snowpack and air temperature will alter selective pressures on overwintering organisms, and may significantly affect growth and reproduction in summer. The central hypothesis is that variation in snow cover alters selective pressures on cold hardiness and energy conservation, influencing physiological performance of overwintering individuals and genetic composition of survivors. The investigators further hypothesize that cold hardiness trades off against future reproduction by depleting winter energy reserves due to energetic costs of cold hardiness. The research will: 1) Measure how variation in snow alters selective gradients on winter-relevant genetic variation in a high altitude beetle, and isolate causal drivers of winter selective gradients. 2) Gain a predictive and quantitative understanding of how cold and energy stressors interact to shape physiological performance during winter and the subsequent summer. 3) Uncover mechanisms underlying interactions between cold and energy stress by asking how single or combined stressors alter reaction norms for energy reserves and cryoprotectants."

A high throughput imaging flow cytometer is an ideal solution for the pharmaceutical and biotechnology industries, as well as flow cytometry core facilities, because of the demand for higher throughput cellular analysis. In addition to drug discovery, the imaging capability of this flow cytometer will enable researchers to perform rare cell detection with higher precision than is currently available, and ultimately, in vitro hematology and oncology diagnostics using imaging flow cytometry. Finally, a high throughput flow cytometer with an order of magnitude greater throughput will dramatically reduce the time researchers spend in flow cytometry core facilities, ultimately enabling a general increase in biomedical research productivity.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to improve the efficiency of drug discovery by introducing a higher throughput, high content screening (HCS) instrument. HCS investigates the effects and associated mechanisms of action of therapeutic compounds by measuring multiple parameters from individual cells, typically using imaging. Although HCS has been highly effective in discovery new drugs, it, unfortunately, has significant throughput limitations. Namely, HCS requires data to be collected at the single cell level versus the population level. Typically, low-throughput readout techniques, such as flow cytometry and fluorescence imaging, are used to collect this data. This project aims to alleviate the speed limitations associated with imaging in drug discovery by introducing a high-throughput imaging flow cytometer capable of performing sub-cellular imaging at the speeds of traditional high throughput screening. The project leverages a high-speed fluorescence imaging modality based on frequency domain multiplexing, which was developed and demonstrated in Phase I, to provide market-leading imaging performance. Expanding this technology into a full flow cytometer by the end of Phase II, the goal is to have a 3-laser, 10-color imaging flow cytometer ready for researchers performing HCS as well as the general biomedical research community."

At the beginning of the 1800s, prairie covered a great swath of North America. Since then, about 99% of the tallgrass prairie has been destroyed. The small, isolated patches of prairie that remain harbor great biodiversity, yet rates of local plant extinctions are alarmingly high in remnant prairies. This project will advance scientific understanding of why some populations go extinct and others persist. Threats to prairie populations include fire suppression, declines of pollinators, inbreeding, loss of genetic diversity, and a reduced capacity to evolve by natural selection. This project builds on a long-term investigation of these ecological and genetic processes and feedbacks between them affecting a model prairie plant species. The purple coneflower typifies prairie plants in its long lifespan, often decades, and in other attributes. This study is the first of its kind to illustrate a population's capacity to adapt. In addition to advancing scientific knowledge and disseminating information to scientists and land stewards, this project will provide research experience and training to diverse participants at a level appropriate for their interests and career stage: high school, college, and graduate students, teachers, and citizen scientists in Minnesota and at the Chicago Botanic Garden.<br/><br/>The project uses formal quantitative genetic approaches and common garden experimental designs to quantify additive genetic variance for fitness, population differentiation, and inbreeding depression. Researchers will estimate the amount of genetic variation in Darwinian fitness of individuals planted in 2003, many of which flowered for the first time in 2015 using aster statistical models to analyze fitness data. Other experiments will estimate the reduction in mean fitness due to mating between siblings. Together with demographic censuses of remnant populations, started in 1996, these studies will yield comprehensive assessments of population growth rates and the potential for evolutionary rescue. A key strength of the research is that experiments are conducted in a realistic habitat, including interactions of the coneflower with its pollinators and herbivores. The core datasets comprise continuous individual fitness records, including annual survival and reproduction of over 17,000 plants in ten experiments and in 27 natural prairie remnants in Minnesota. These datasets, which will extend up to 30 years by the end of the project, offer a rare window into the interplay of evolutionary and ecological processes of a long-lived species."

Atypical Gulf Stream position, air-sea heat flux, extremes in ocean temperature, and sea level rise are potential harbingers of larger shifts in atmospheric and oceanic forcing. Effects on shelf-deep ocean exchange are unknown due to incomplete dynamical understanding of the present. Development of predictive capacity is particularly relevant at this time, as oil and gas exploration is being planned. The understanding of shelf-deep ocean exchange gained through this project will be applicable to other regions where shelf and basin-scale currents converge and could improve our capacity to anticipate the response of the coastal ocean to climate change in the coming decades. In addition to the physical interactions between scales and oceanic regions, the relevance of exported shelf waters at Cape Hatteras to global carbon budgets may be large, and is difficult to quantify due to carbon budget mediation by biological ecosystems that vary with season and water mass. Both ecosystems and export processes may change under predicted climatic shifts, so understanding export processes has broad biogeochemical importance. Collaborations with biogeochemists and ecologists will be pursued to utilize the data to study ecosystems in this area of high biological diversity that is home to many commercially important species. Insights gained through the project will also improve mitigation of pollutant spills. The outreach and educational efforts include a public exhibit and talks, opportunities for joining science cruises and participation in the Society of Women Engineers ""Girls Engineer It! Day"", a daylong event for girls in grades 6-12, and the Wood Hole Oceanographic Institution's summer program for undergraduates from underrepresented groups. The project will support two early career scientists, train one postdoctoral researcher and four graduate students, and give undergraduate students hands-on experience in the operation of the autonomous gliders.<br/><br/>Subtropical and subpolar oceanic gyre boundaries are characterized by confluent western boundary currents and convergence in the adjacent shelf and slope waters. Together, they lead to large net export of shelf waters to the deep ocean, and complex, bidirectional shelf-deep ocean exchange, in response to strong forcing typical of mid-latitude western ocean margins. Shelf-deep ocean exchange processes at such dynamic sites remain poorly understood, due in part to the technical challenge of resolving broad ranges of relevant spatial and temporal scales. The understanding gained by investigating the wide seasonal range of parameter space will facilitate exploration of how shelf circulation and shelf-open ocean exchange may evolve due to observed and projected long-term shifts in regional and basin-scale circulation, hydrography, and atmospheric forcing. This project will deploy fixed, mobile, and remote observational platforms in combination with idealized and realistic numerical simulations to investigate exchange processes near Cape Hatteras. The sampling array will provide an observational data set with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution in a region of large episodic export and exchange. These observations will be used to identify dominant exchange processes; correlate them with observed forcing; define ranges of forcing and shelf response; verify parallel developments within the realistic model framework; and establish causation through detailed assessment of momentum and vorticity balances, integrating observational and validated model products. In addition to physical data, the autonomous gliders will also collect chlorophyll fluorescence, oxygen saturation, and acoustic backscatter data that are of direct relevance to biogeochemical properties exported from the shelf to the deep ocean. These non-physical data will be used as water mass tracers and to portray the structure of the chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen at unprecedented resolution."

Recent research suggests these changes are occurring significantly on regional scales, but due to model uncertainties, it is difficult to constrain the difference between anthropogenic and natural influences. In studying climate change and its effect on ocean biogeochemistry in the future, it is crucial to be able to distinguish between these influences; therefore, it is critical to identify and quantify the uncertainty in Earth System Models (ESMs). The researchers will use output from Community Earth System Model (CESM) and models participating in the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) to isolate prediction uncertainty due to 1) internal variability, 2) model structure, and 3) emission scenario. This research will bridge an existing gap between Earth System Models and observational studies to assess how climate change will influence ocean biogeochemistry.  Additionally, this project will support an early-career scientist and a graduate student, and the researchers are dedicated to mentoring undergraduate students through various programs at Colorado University - Boulder, National Center for Atmospheric Research, and the University of Wisconsin. <br/><br/>Earth System Model (ESM) simulations used to predict future changes in ocean biogeochemistry attributed to either natural or anthropogenic influences suffer from uncertainties, particularly on regional scales. This is problematic because, as the ocean continues to undergo large-scale change under the current climate, it is crucial to have an accurate predictor of the future and to be able to delineate between natural and anthropogenic forcing. This research aims to quantify the uncertainty on three levels: uncertainty due to internal variability, model structure, and emission scenario. Using output from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and models in the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), this study will evaluate the degree to which uncertainty has changed with newer models. Additionally, observations from global databased, satellites, and time-series sites will be used to compare models and assess the varying levels of skill in predicting the biogeochemistry of a region. The researchers also plan to break down the various components of the driving mechanisms behind prediction uncertainty, so that future models can begin to take these factors into account."

Ice streams and outlet glaciers are the major pathways for ice discharge from ice sheets into the ocean. Consequently, understanding ice stream dynamics, specifically the processes controlling the frictional resistance of ice sliding on sediments at its base, is essential for predictive modeling of how Earth's ice sheets will respond to a changing climate. Rather than flowing smoothly, Whillans Ice Stream advances in stick-slip cycles: brief periods of rapid sliding, equivalent to magnitude 7 earthquakes, alternating with much longer periods of repose. The PIs will perform simulations of these stick-slip cycles using computer codes originally developed for modeling tectonic earthquakes. By matching observed ice motions, the PIs will constrain the range of frictional processes acting at the base of the ice stream. An additional focus of the project is on brittle fracture processes in ice, expressed through seismic waves radiated by faulting and/or crevassing episodes that accompany the large-scale sliding events. An understanding of ice fracture provides a basis for assessing the susceptibility of ice shelves to rifting and catastrophic disintegration. Project results will be incorporated into outreach activities (from elementary school to community college events) as well as a polar science class for the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) program for high school students.<br/><br/>Simulations of the stick-slip cycle will employ 3D dynamic rupture models that simultaneously solve for the seismic wavefield and rupture process, consistent with elastodynamic material response and friction laws on the ice stream bed. Stresses and frictional properties will be varied to achieve consistency with surface GPS and broadband seismic data as well as borehole seismograms from the WISSARD project. The results will be interpreted using laboratory till friction experiments, which link velocity-weakening/strengthening behavior to temperature and water content, and to related experiments quantifying basal drag from ice flow over rough beds. The source mechanism of seismicity accompanying the slip events (shear faulting versus crevassing) will be determined using 3D waveform modeling in conjunction with mechanical models of the seismic source processes.  This proposal does not require fieldwork in the Antarctic."

The PI proposes to develop novel computational algorithms and cloud computing software to decipher terabytes of metagenomic sequencing data for studying the human microbiome. Experience from these pursuits will accelerate development of the proposed tools for better understanding the ecosystem in our bodies. Ultimately, this may contribute to better diagnosis, prevention, and treatment of disease. Furthermore, the proposed cloud computing algorithms and techniques could be adapted to many other applications demanding high computation complexity. A key proposal ingredient is offering graduate and undergraduate computer science students a unique opportunity for interdisciplinary research designing algorithms and software to solve biological problems. <br/><br/>Novel computational algorithms and a cloud computing software tool are proposed, to analyze large-scale metagenomic sequencing data to study the human microbiome. The project would feature Apache Spark, a cutting-edge, open-source cluster computing framework for large-scale data processing. It supports a rich set of high-level tools including scalable machine learning and graph processing libraries. The primary novelty is a cloud scalable de novo assembler, and the ability to compare assembled sequences to existing reference genomes using Spark libraries. This new approach will speed identification of novel genomes and composition of microbes from large metagenomic data. Most existing metagenomic analysis methods separately execute de novo sequence assembly and taxonomy classification with many existing reference genomes. Key technical innovations of the proposed work are (i) cloud computing algorithms enabling a fast and scalable metagenome assembler, (ii) taking assembled sequences directly for taxonomy to dramatically reduce computation time, and (iii) a cloud container package allowing researchers to analyze metagenomic data easily and cheaply. Providing a cloud container package with a simple Web interface will enable researchers to analyze their large-scale metagenomic sequence data readily and quickly for human health, biosurveillance, and pan-genomic analysis of microbiota."

A fundamental means by which plant species cope with this challenge is through monitoring day length, the environmental signal that most reliably predicts calendar date. Based on that information, individuals then either continue vegetative growth or initiate flowering. The most favorable time of year for flowering differs by location. For instance, winter arrives earlier at higher latitudes and elevations. Therefore, understanding how and why photoperiodic flowering responses have been adjusted to permit species to thrive across broad geographic ranges is important knowledge that can inform efforts to preserve biodiversity and successfully manage crops in the face of a changing environment. The proposed work will address this goal by studying how populations of the common monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus, vary along elevation gradients in the critical day length necessary to induce flowering. The molecular changes and ecological impacts of this variation will be investigated with complementary studies in the lab and field. These combined datasets will then permit development of predictive models to test whether populations will be resilient to future climates. The investigators - working with undergraduates at three University of California institutions, the USA National Phenology Network, and volunteers - will also develop a new citizen science initiative to monitor the flowering of important wildflower species in remote alpine locations along the Pacific Crest Trail.<br/><br/>Although much is known about the molecular mechanisms by which photoperiod regulates flowering in controlled conditions, far less is understood about how these pathways function in natural seasonal conditions or what adjustments to these pathways may prove beneficial in future climates. Preliminary work in M. guttatus has shown that replicate altitudinal shifts in critical photoperiod evolved through changes at distinct sets of loci. The proposed research will characterize the genetic basis and physiological consequences of these diverse mechanisms by utilizing the extensive genomic toolkit available in this emerging model plant system. Specifically, the molecular basis of range-wide variation in critical photoperiod will be established. Through transcriptional analyses under controlled conditions and through field trials, the investigators will also test whether the distinct sets of loci that achieve similar shifts in critical photoperiod do so via equivalent modifications of downstream expression within the flowering gene regulatory network or have unique effects that are adaptive within each local environment. The former finding would suggest a broad capacity for physiological systems to adjust to novel conditions, and the latter would suggest genetic variation may prove a significant constraint on the pace of adaptation. Finally, through investigating forms of diversity abundant in annual M. guttatus but not well explored in other model plants, the proposed research will extend ecophysiological models of flowering time and foster more accurate forecasts of the impact of environmental variation on plant growth and population distribution."

Atypical Gulf Stream position, air-sea heat flux, extremes in ocean temperature, and sea level rise are potential harbingers of larger shifts in atmospheric and oceanic forcing. Effects on shelf-deep ocean exchange are unknown due to incomplete dynamical understanding of the present. Development of predictive capacity is particularly relevant at this time, as oil and gas exploration is being planned. The understanding of shelf-deep ocean exchange gained through this project will be applicable to other regions where shelf and basin-scale currents converge and could improve our capacity to anticipate the response of the coastal ocean to climate change in the coming decades. In addition to the physical interactions between scales and oceanic regions, the relevance of exported shelf waters at Cape Hatteras to global carbon budgets may be large, and is difficult to quantify due to carbon budget mediation by biological ecosystems that vary with season and water mass. Both ecosystems and export processes may change under predicted climatic shifts, so understanding export processes has broad biogeochemical importance. Collaborations with biogeochemists and ecologists will be pursued to utilize the data to study ecosystems in this area of high biological diversity that is home to many commercially important species. Insights gained through the project will also improve mitigation of pollutant spills. The outreach and educational efforts include a public exhibit and talks, opportunities for joining science cruises and participation in the Society of Women Engineers ""Girls Engineer It! Day"", a daylong event for girls in grades 6-12, and the Wood Hole Oceanographic Institution's summer program for undergraduates from underrepresented groups. The project will support two early career scientists, train one postdoctoral researcher and four graduate students, and give undergraduate students hands-on experience in the operation of the autonomous gliders.<br/><br/>Subtropical and subpolar oceanic gyre boundaries are characterized by confluent western boundary currents and convergence in the adjacent shelf and slope waters. Together, they lead to large net export of shelf waters to the deep ocean, and complex, bidirectional shelf-deep ocean exchange, in response to strong forcing typical of mid-latitude western ocean margins. Shelf-deep ocean exchange processes at such dynamic sites remain poorly understood, due in part to the technical challenge of resolving broad ranges of relevant spatial and temporal scales. The understanding gained by investigating the wide seasonal range of parameter space will facilitate exploration of how shelf circulation and shelf-open ocean exchange may evolve due to observed and projected long-term shifts in regional and basin-scale circulation, hydrography, and atmospheric forcing. This project will deploy fixed, mobile, and remote observational platforms in combination with idealized and realistic numerical simulations to investigate exchange processes near Cape Hatteras. The sampling array will provide an observational data set with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution in a region of large episodic export and exchange. These observations will be used to identify dominant exchange processes; correlate them with observed forcing; define ranges of forcing and shelf response; verify parallel developments within the realistic model framework; and establish causation through detailed assessment of momentum and vorticity balances, integrating observational and validated model products. In addition to physical data, the autonomous gliders will also collect chlorophyll fluorescence, oxygen saturation, and acoustic backscatter data that are of direct relevance to biogeochemical properties exported from the shelf to the deep ocean. These non-physical data will be used as water mass tracers and to portray the structure of the chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen at unprecedented resolution."

Lacking long term data, an alternative approach is to examine shorter-term change in species interactions in response to rapid climate shifts, and combine that information with a detailed understanding of long-term climatic trends. This project extends a detailed study of pollinator abundance and species diversity (primarily bumblebees) with plant flowering patterns in coastal, central California.  This region had been experiencing an increasingly severe drought, and average temperatures that have been increasing for decades.  The current warm, wet El Nino event presents a unique opportunity to assess the responses and resilience of this system of pollinators and plant species.  A diverse and abundant assemblage of pollinator species is critical to the maintenance of native plant species in this region.  This study will inform the management of nature reserves and will also provide important information on how pollinators, which are essential to US agriculture, respond to climate change. The project will help broaden participation in science through graduate student training, and through a workshop to engage land managers of relevant habitats.<br/><br/>The work addresses three specific, testable hypotheses: (1) plant flowering and pollinator activity will be temporally disconnected in the wet El Nino year; (2) bumblebees respond immediately to the resource boom provided by heavy, extended flowering in the El Nino, but solitary bee responses will be delayed a year; and (3) pollinator networks will be more specialized in the wet El Nino year than during the drought, because bees will select more preferred plant species when flowers are abundant.  The potential temporal mismatch is an important ecological problem in the context of changing climatic variability."

Of these, polymer-based nanoparticles are particularly attractive for their softer, more dynamic character, facilitating the construction process. Surface pattering of polymer particles at the nanometer scale, while challenging, can be accomplished through the use of assembling subunits with a molecular architecture that will lead to a 'clustering' effect. This award allows the exploration of the use of polymers with a bottle-brush architecture as subunits for the formation of 'patchy' nanoparticles. Unlike the more traditional linear polymers, considerably less is known about the assembly behavior of polymers with a complex architecture, opening new routes for the formation of polymer-based nanomaterials with unique functions. The research will examine solution self- and co-assembly of these polymers and establish relationships between polymer architecture, processing routes and aggregate morphology. Outreach efforts supported under this award will involve participation of undergraduate students in research, and community involvement through an education-based Latino outreach program targeting K-12 students. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this award is to explore the molecular and processing determinants of assemblies from highly grafted polymers, with particular emphasis on the construction of nanoparticles exhibiting surface and core heterogeneity. Advances in controlled polymerization methods have enabled the synthesis of macromolecules with increasing functional and architectural complexity such as macromolecular brushes or bottle-brushes. In contrast to linear diblock copolymers, little is known about the factors that influence solution assembly of macromolecules. Furthermore, it has been previously shown that kinetic pathways of polymer assembly are determining factors of assembly morphologies from linear block copolymers, whereas the non-equilibrium behavior of macromolecules with more complex architectures remains unexplored. This award addresses two related objectives. First objective is to study nanoparticle formation from amphiphilic macromolecular brush copolymers by a rapid assembly process. This will allow to both elucidate the mechanism of brush copolymer assembly into multi-molecular nanoparticles, and determine absolute timescales of assembly. Second objective is to study the formation of complex heterogeneous nanosystems from amphiphilic macromolecular brush building-blocks. This involves co-assembly of families of macromolecular brushes with varying degrees of chemical dissimilarity through kinetic trapping. While there are many reported methods for fabricating composite nanoparticles exhibiting surface and/or core heterogeneity, clustering of relatively soft and adaptive building-blocks could provide the means for further intra-particle modifications."

Flies are fed a chemical that causes mutations in the DNA, the progeny are bred and then examined for altered development of the fly. A mutation that breaks an essential gene will cause dramatic changes in the body pattern. Many of the fly genes identified this way have human counterparts, which perform very similar functions during human development. The Bejsovec laboratory uses this strategy to study the inner workings of a genetic pathway that is shared between flies and humans. This pathway, triggered by the Wg/Wnt growth factor, tells cells where they are in the body and what special structure to become; inappropriate re-activation of the Wnt pathway in adult tissues is associated with human cancers. The Bejsovec lab has found that three genes already known to work together to control cell division, have a second unexpected function in controlling the Wnt pathway. This project will determine how these genes exert control over the pathway, and how their action disrupts the fly body plan. Broader impacts of the project include deeper understanding of developmental mechanisms in all animal species, and a hands-on research experience for undergraduate and high school students in the Bejsovec laboratory and for undergraduates in an existing laboratory course.<br/><br/>     Although the Wg/Wnt pathway plays a central role in development and tissue homeostasis, the sequence of events, from Wg/Wnt binding at the cell surface to the downstream activation of target genes, is still not completely understood. Tumbleweed (Tum), Pavarotti (Pav) and Pebble (Pbl) repress Wg/Wnt pathway activity in cultured human cells and in fly embryos. These genes may represent a crucial missing link, perhaps missed in earlier screens for Wg/Wnt pathway components because all three genes have essential functions in cell division. In cytokinesis, Tum and Pav position Pbl-RhoGEF at the equator to activate the G protein, Rho, which organizes the actin contractile ring. Work proposed here will determine whether (and how) Tum, Pav, and Pbl make contact with known Wg/Wnt components, and will test whether GTPase activation is involved. In addition, reducing Tum or Pbl function in adult precursor cells creates a novel homeotic transformation which may result from the simultaneous disruption of cell signaling and cell division. Genetic and molecular tools available in Drosophila will be used to determine how misregulation of signaling and/or cytokinesis might alter segmental identity. The resulting data will provide insight into Wg/Wnt pathway control and tissue patterning, and may reveal new connections between cell division and cell fate specification during development. The unique appearance of the transformed flies will appeal to undergraduate and high school students, engaging them in the scientific enterprise and helping to recruit a diverse group, including women, socioeconomically disadvantaged and underrepresented minority students, into the workforce."

Proteins are large molecules with thousands of atoms and perform most cellular functions. Proteins consist of long chains of amino acids, and these chains fold into specific structures. In general, proteins must alter their shape in order to perform their biological function. For example, Hemoglobin, the protein that transports oxygen, changes shape in order for oxygen to bind. The internal vibrations of the protein structure that enable this change in shape are critical for understanding protein function. Recently a method has been devised to measure protein internal vibrations, called crystal anisotropic terahertz microscopy (CATM). The instrumentation and protocol development in this project makes CATM accessible to non-specialists, and enables broad application of the technique. The development of this instrument leads to the interdisciplinary education of two graduate students and two undergraduates. Integrated with the instrument development are educational and outreach activities that include an undergraduate seminar course and a week-long summer program for 7-12th grade inner city students from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to produce a compact turn-key spectroscopic system for the routine characterization of intramolecular vibrations of proteins. The technique called crystal anisotropic terahertz (THz) spectroscopy (CATM) uniquely measures these motions. Auto-CATM  provides non-experts with the ability to quickly and easily categorize and classify biomacromolecules. The mini-system from Zomega Terahertz Corp. is the starting platform for the final instrument. A proof-of-concept database, and molecular modeling and data visualization software toolbox facilitate the development this new instrument. This instrument provides insights into how intramolecular vibrations are impacted by frequently modified parameters such as binding state and temperature. The technology developed for Auto-CATM also enable new rapid measurements for both bulk and micron scale materials and thus impact solid state physics and materials science."

Such flows mix efficiently on average, and they rapidly disperse material that they carry with them. They do not, however, mix uniformly. Rather, they spontaneously form complex patterns that lead to persistent inhomogeneities. In an oil spill, for example, oil does not move away uniformly from its source; instead, the oil wanders out in tendrils and whorls that are locked to the underlying structure of the ocean surface flow. In recent years, powerful methods have been developed to uncover the hidden structures that govern mixing in unsteady flows, and to isolate the transport barriers that separate different regions of the flow. Almost nothing is known, however, about how to control the location or presence of these dynamical barriers, or even whether it is possible to do so. This award will support research to demonstrate that control of these barriers is indeed possible, and to understand how barriers respond to external forces or to the shape of the container holding the fluid. The results of this research will have significant implications in a range of applications. For example, knowing how barriers in the ocean are related to coastline shape will inform the siting of coastal facilities that may discharge waste products or the deployment of limited resources in an environmental disaster. In other situations, such as in industrial mixers, rapid mixing is desirable, and so understanding how to inhibit the formation of transport barriers would be valuable.<br/><br/>Existing methods for locating transport barriers often require knowledge of the future evolution of the flow, and so have limited utility as predictive tools. This research will surmount this limitation by asking not how barriers will evolve naturally but rather how they can be manipulated and controlled. Two ways to control transport barriers will be investigated in an electromagnetically driven laboratory flow: control via spatio-temporally modulated applied body forces and control via lateral and bottom boundary shape. By demonstrating how transport barriers respond to manipulation of these quantities rather than to an imposed control velocity field, which is difficult to achieve in practice, the results of the research will pave the way for the development of implementable control strategies for real-world situations."

Furthermore, medical practitioners are using these systems to monitor proper activity levels for rehabilitation purposes and to monitor threatening conditions such as heart arrhythmias. However, there is substantial work to be done to facilitate the processing and interpretation of such information in order to maximize impact. This proposal develops a computational framework that models the complex interactions between physiological and environmental factors contributing to an individual's health.

To accomplish this objective, the framework will build on tools from statistical analysis, topological data analysis, optimization theory and human behavior analysis. This novel framework will not only develop new formal techniques, but it will also serve as a bridge between these cross-disciplinary fields. In particular, the proposed hierarchical computational framework has the potential of providing a trade-off between accuracy and computational flexibility based on the choice of granularity of the representation. This award will: (1) develop methodology for the concurrent representation of physiological, kinematic and environmental states for inference purposes; (2) develop techniques for mapping representations between different systems to enable information sharing; and (3) develop techniques to maximize the impact on the behavior of individuals by building on the proposed data representation.   The algorithm development will be informed by integration of limitations on embedded platforms due to memory, computational and power capabilities, and transmission costs when off-board processing is required. The proposed techniques will empower users and medical practitioners to understand, analyze, and make decisions based on patterns in the data. The outcomes of this project will empower medical practitioners by providing innovative and effective tools for wearable sensing systems which enable efficient pattern identification, data representation and visualization. Besides training students directly working on this project, the data sets and algorithms developed will be incorporated into a new graduate course on computational techniques for physiological and environmental sensing. Undergraduate students will be engaged by participating in data collection experiments, REUs, and local demonstrations. Underrepresented undergraduate student communities will be exposed to the research at the national level by presenting demos at well-known diversity conferences in the STEM fields. Furthermore, K-12 local student communities will be engaged via summer workshops that will be prepared for students and educators."

This Noyce Track 4B research project seeks to address one of the areas identified as it studies the extent to which those institutions receiving Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship (Noyce) funding from the National Science Foundation have prepared more knowledgeable beginning teachers than those institutions which have not received Noyce grants during Noyce funding cycles as measured by outcomes on Praxis II subject matter knowledge exams given to first time test takers. Through a collaborative research effort between Stony Brook University and Kennesaw State University, and working with the Educational Testing Service (ETS), the project will undertake the disaggregation of Praxis II test scores over the past fifteen years to determine to what extent those institutions receiving Noyce funding have prepared more knowledgeable beginning teachers than those without Noyce awards.  <br/><br/>The list of Noyce awardees from the NSF website will be used to categorize Praxis II test takers coming from Noyce and non-Noyce institutions over the past fifteen years. Using the self-reported demographic data from Praxis II test takers, the institutional codes will be compared to the Noyce and non-Noyce institution list and a simple count of students at each institution will be performed. As not all states have used Praxis II exams for licensure, only a subset of the Noyce portfolio will be captured in the analysis. The measure of teacher knowledge will be analyzed at two levels related to outcomes on the Praxis II subject matter knowledge exams. Level 1: analysis will use individual state cut scores for the respective year exams. This will provide a look at whether institutions are preparing STEM teacher candidates for a level pre-determined by their respective states. Level 2: analysis of Praxis II subject matter knowledge for a raw percent correct score on the exam.  An average exam score will be calculated for each exam and teacher candidates will be placed into groups based on their performance relative to the mean (i.e., 1 standard deviation above the mean, 1 standard deviation below the mean, etc.). The outcome variables described in Level 1 and Level 2 will be analyzed as well as additional differences in performance by demographic variables for the total population and also by Noyce and non-Noyce institutions. Example questions that will be answered include: Do Noyce institutions prepare more minority STEM teacher candidates compared to non-Noyce institutions? Do women at Noyce institutions outperform women at non-Noyce institutions based on STEM Praxis II content knowledge exams? Do Noyce institutions have a higher number of non-traditional first-time Praxis II test takers compared to their non-Noyce peers? In order to develop a model for impact of Noyce on different institutions, average incoming SAT scores will be used as a covariate in the regression analysis that will control for selectivity of the institution. In the descriptive analysis, only schools with similar entrance requirements and average SAT/ACT scores to each other will be used. In order to measure the impact of the Noyce funding related to the quality of the scholars in situations where a university has had both Noyce scholars and non-Noyce scholars, data on the number of test takers in each Praxis II STEM field, their average GPA, and whether or not they have in-field majors prior to Noyce funding will be used to establish a baseline for number and type of teacher education graduates. This will allow for analysis of subsequent data to determine whether these patterns changed after receiving Noyce funding. An empirical study will be conducted limited to a subsample of the NOYCE schools to examine the effect of the proportion of Noyce graduates to total STEM education graduates in the given year. It will be included as a coefficient in the regression models to adjust the comparison of averages between the Noyce institutions based on the size of the proportion. If there is evidence that the ratio is related to the average PRAXIS scores at the institution level, then it will be collected on additional schools and incorporated into the comparison of averages between Noyce and non-Noyce institutions.  Ultimately, this study will examine the influence of the Noyce program on the depth of content knowledge for beginning STEM teachers as they enter the profession."

However, compared to that of eddies in the open ocean, the role of Gulf Stream warm core rings in the biophysical processes of the shelf-slope system has received less attention, and contrasting results exist. This study will elucidate the key biophysical mechanisms by investigating the biomass characteristics and the dominant physical mechanisms controlling the vertical nutrient delivery associated with Gulf Stream warm core rings.  The improved understanding on nutrient dynamics from this research will contribute to the stewardship of living marine resources, and better ecosystem management. Research findings will be presented to the general public through public lectures. This project will also support the training of undergraduate students outside of oceanography through the Summer Undergraduate Research Program at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution.<br/><br/>This project investigates the physical-biological processes associated with the evolution of Gulf Stream warm core rings in the shelf-slope system of the Northwest Atlantic, with a focus on the dominant physical processes controlling vertical nutrient delivery. The research will include analyses of satellite data, historical in situ data, and numerical simulations. For better understanding of the relative importance of several mesoscale biophysical processes, the photoautotrophic biomass within the warm core rings will be characterized first using satellite observed sea surface height and chlorophyll concentration. The investigators will then conduct idealized numerical modeling experiments to identify the dominant physical processes responsible for vertical nutrient delivery including vertical mixing and vertical advection induced by frictional decay, eddy-induced Ekman pumping, and wind-sea surface temperature interaction.  The findings from the idealized modeling will be further synthesized in a realistic coupled biophysical model for the Northwest Atlantic region."

The synthesis and processing of materials in the 21st century requires a new paradigm where the physical sciences, engineering and computational modeling come together. Solving some of the most pressing challenges in the areas of health, energy and the environment provides challenging research projects for this REU Site.  The unique aspect of this program is the interdisciplinary environment, which is an essential component of materials research.  The interdisciplinary team-based approach reflects the environment these students will encounter as they transition to their careers in industry, academe or in national labs. The Nanoscience and Microsystems interdisciplinary program is based on the premise that to benefit society the unique properties of nanoscale materials must be integrated into micro- and macro-scale devices and then further into systems. Projects include drug delivery, biocides, protein aggregation and sensing, nanoparticle dynamics, catalysts, nano fluidics and energy conversion.<br/><br/>Students will be recruited from diverse ethnic, educational as well as cultural backgrounds.  This includes students from community colleges and primarily undergraduate institutions across the country. Students work for 10 summer weeks with a research advisor and a mentor (graduate student/post-doc). The aim is to instill a spirit of inquiry by integrating research and education, and to enhance student interest in pursuing careers in the sciences and engineering. Students are guided through all aspects of research, preparing a proposal, making a plan of research, executing this plan and analyzing and presenting the significance of their work. In this manner, students transition from a relatively dependent status to one where they start to ask questions and suggest new experiments. Students also participate in a series of seminars that will include faculty, national lab and industry speakers. Field trips to the National Laboratories and to local industries enhance their exposure to career opportunities and exciting research problems. The summer research program provides students the excitement of participating in open-ended research, at the same time connecting this research with their academic curriculum."

However, the resistance to fracture (often termed the toughness), i.e. the ability to tolerate cracks without catastrophic fracture, is often compromised upon increase in strength. This is especially true at low temperatures where toughness is substantially lower. Another important measure, the ductility - the ability of the material to sustain large elongations or deflections - also suffers upon raising the strength in conventional alloys. This award supports fundamental research to provide understanding towards the development of a new class of alloys called the high entropy alloys (HEAs) which have the capability of possessing both a high strength, high toughness, and high ductility. These alloys involve multiple elements but derive strength through interactions of elements at small scales, and circumvent the loss of ductility even at very low temperatures, broadening their potential use.  These alloys can enable wide-scale deployment in areas critical to the US economy including mechanical, civil, and materials science sectors. The work will educate graduate students and also help broaden participation of underrepresented groups through outreach at the high school level, including summer programs with demonstrations of alloy behavior and hands-on activities making useful devices with alloys.<br/><br/>Two of the most important mechanisms in plastic deformation of metals are slip and twinning. Exceptional properties can be achieved for cases where slip deformation and twinning deformation can occur simultaneously with unprecedented strain hardening. Their mutual synergism can produce superior properties. In this work, first principles simulations of potential new high entropy alloy compositions will consider the energy landscapes for slip and twin deformation, and develop models that encompass both continuum and atomistic effects. The most promising alloys will then be manufactured and tested. Experimental methodologies will then be developed to measure the onset of slip and twin events at low temperatures where the tremendous benefits of these materials will be realized. The experiments will also consider finite temperatures and aim to advance digital image correlation methods (a technique for measuring local displacements and strains) to subgrain-submicron scales to understand precisely the deformation phenomenon in these alloys."

To empirically test the prediction of such a theory, one needs to recover valuations of the players. Most econometric methods used to recover valuations rely on the assumption that the game is at a stable equilibrium (known as a Nash equilibrium). It is not surprising that such a framework provides a poor fit to the data in changing or new markets. At the same time, there is a growing theoretical literature in algorithmic game theory that allows one to study games where the game is not at a stable equilibrium. The PIs' program focuses on developing a methodology for inference without relying on the standard notions of the stability of outcomes in dynamically changing environments, such as online auctions. The goal of this project is to develop a theory that allows the researchers to take advantage of new dynamic data sets from electronic markets available on the Internet, and using the findings from the data to further the underlying theory.<br/> <br/>The results of the project are intended to enable to application and development of Data Science tools for analysis and prediction in  non-stable and new market settings. This will affect a broad community of empirical researchers such as market analysts, by allowing them to study economic markets that have previously been considered hard or impossible to analyze.<br/><br/>The research program is based on using the theoretical results from algorithmic game theory on game outcomes when players use no-regret learning rules and combine these results with econometric techniques that allow one to estimate the best responses of players from the data using a set of non-parametric estimation techniques. The goal of the program, which PIs initiated in a paper in the ACM Conference on Economics and Computation in 2014, is to combine these approaches to develop a set of analytic tools for empirical analysis of games in non-equilibrium settings. Algorithmic game theory helps one to characterize the properties of outcomes in games (such as approximating factors for revenue and welfare in various cases), where the game is not at a stable equilibrium, assuming players use strategies that guarantee a certain no-regret property in place of the stronger equilibrium best response assumption. The project is aimed at combining the insights from algorithmic game theory with econometric methods to enable the analysis of dynamic markets. The intellectual merit of the project is twofold: (i) providing a methodology for inference in games (i.e., estimation of the payoff functions of players and the distribution of player types) in cases where the players use general classes of learning strategies; (ii) providing tools for the analysis of outcomes in non-equilibrium environments, including the analysis of statistical properties of the outcomes constructed using inferred preferences and types."

In order to do this, a number of sophisticated mathematical tools are often required. One of the more prominent tools used in this way are polynomials. Polynomials are both varied enough to express or approximate a number of objects of interest, and yet are also simple enough that properties of them can be easily understood. Thus, relating properties of the objects in question to properties of polynomials is a well-known technique that shows up in many areas of computer science.<br/><br/>Unfortunately, our understanding of these fundamental objects is far from complete. In fact, there are a number of problems for which our lack of understanding can be seen as a bottleneck for proving further results about problems of interest. This project will focus on attempts to remedy this gap. In particular, the PI plans to follow up on several recent advances in understanding of this area and to attempt to leverage any new results to gain insight into other important questions within computer science. In addition to leading to new algorithms of practical import, the research promises to have potential impacts in other fields such as probability theory and<br/>algebraic geometry.<br/><br/>More specifically, the PI intends to improve upon existing tools for understanding low degree polynomials in many variables. Of particular interest would be work relating to results on the distribution of the values of such a polynomial on random inputs, with particular focus on recent structural results that allow one to decompose arbitrary polynomials in terms of better behaved ones. Having attained such results, the project will continue by making use of these improvements in order to make progress on other important problems in theoretical computer science. In particular, there are a number of specific problems in the areas of explicit pseudorandom generators, machine learning, and circuit complexity for which such technical improvements show promise for providing substantial new results.<br/><br/>In addition to the research component of this project, the PI intends to help provide new educational opportunities particularly with regard to learning mathematical problem solving skills which are a key component of mathematics and computer science research."

The investigator whose work will be supported will investigate the drivers and consequences of these ecological and political changes for the conservation of biodiversity and sustainability of socioeconomic livelihoods.  The project will provide valuable new kinds of basic knowledge.  By structuring the research to account for the different ways in rangelands are managed, the investigator will be able to assess degree to which as well as how wildlife and livestock share the same spaces.  The project will embrace both human and animal individual and group behaviors to clarify the nature of wildlife-livestock relationships, because existing understandings underestimate the role of grazing actions among both wild and domestic grazers.  The results of this research will have a direct bearing on conservation and development policies around the world. New knowledge will be generated to aid in decision making regarding where, when, and under which contexts resource managers might encourage mixed use strategies with respect to livestock and wildlife grazing. These practices have the potential to increase the overall resilience and sustainability of drylands around the Earth.  The project will provide education and training opportunities for students to enhance critical thinking and problem solving skills through experiential learning. The project will enable tourists visiting rangeland protected areas to obtain more accurate and relevant information regarding people and natural systems in and around parks.  The project also is expected to provide new information and insights regarding ways to avoid entrenched pro-livestock or pro-biodiversity positions, thereby reducing the large economic and ecological costs of these positions. <br/><br/>Rangelands are home to millions of livestock keeping pastoralists and sustaining large densities and distributions of wildlife.  More recently, the resilience of rangeland protected areas is being threatened because of changes in where both wildlife and domestic livestock can graze, and the physical effects of grazing.  Changes in seasonality have further constrained the resiliency of drylands.  Current understandings about how people, wildlife, and livestock interact in rangelands have been devoid of appropriate social, political, and ecological contexts.  As a result, there is limited knowledge about the interactions between wildlife and pastoralists' livestock inside rangeland protected areas.  In order to better understand these dynamics, the investigator will evaluate how different management regimes influences patterns of wildlife and livestock resource use.  He will determine the magnitude and extent to which resource patterns are influenced by both human and animal behaviors, and he will assess how wildlife and livestock resource-utilization patterns influence the ecology of rangelands.  To achieve these objectives, the investigator will employ mixed methods approaches that combine ecological, social, and spatial field methods from a long-term study site within the Mara ecosystem in southern Kenya.  Although conducted in this locale, the insights developed through this project will enhance basic understanding in a much broader range of locations, including many in the United States, where individuals and groups managing domesticated grazing animals share the same habitats with wild animals."

The NNCI Coordinating Office at Georgia Tech is established to enhance the impact of NNCI as a national infrastructure network by promoting its capabilities, facilitating user access to its resources, sharing best practices, and improving overall efficiency through coordination of activities of the individual sites. The Coordinating Office will assist users from academe, industry, and government in finding NNCI fabrication and characterization resources to meet their research needs through an interactive NNCI web portal. It will use the expertise of site staff to facilitate programs in education and outreach, social and ethical implications, and computational modeling and simulation across the network, and help provide linkages with other national and international nanotechnology resources. The overall activities of the NNCI Coordinating Office will contribute to the economic competiveness of the U.S. in training a globally competitive workforce and in providing efficient access to resources for innovation and commercialization of nanotechnology. They will also help to inform and educate the general public on fundamentals and advances of nanoscience and engineering and their social and ethical implications.<br/><br/>The mission of the NNCI Coordinating Office is to support the individual NNCI sites, site users, and broader public interests using the combined assets of a nation-wide network of university nanotechnology user facilities. A key component of the Coordinating Office will be the development of mechanisms for communicating availability of network assets to users of the facilities as well as for fostering interactions among the sites. A primary mode for this communication will be an interactive NNCI web portal, which will allow new and existing users to efficiently locate capabilities and expertise within the network, and also provide up-to-date nanotechnology resources to the K-20 communities and broader public. To emphasize the importance of a network of sites, the Coordinating Office will be guided by an Executive Committee with representation from all 16 sites and will organize a number of working groups and committees to address topics of broad interest and solve common problems. A flagship event for the NNCI network will be an annual NNCI Conference that will highlight the research supported by the individual sites, as well as provide a venue for site staff to share best practices and research trends with the broader nanotechnology community. An External Advisory Board with members selected from the external advisory boards of all sites will provide input on network management issues and future directions. Education and outreach activities will be coordinated across the network to share and disseminate best practices and resources for impactful programs at the local, regional, and national levels. Social and ethical implications programs, such as an annual retreat and conference forums, will enable social scientists to interact with nanoscale scientists, engineers, and students so that all groups can consider the potential impacts new discoveries might have on society. Computational modeling and simulation needs of the user community will be supported through an inventory of available resources and close collaboration with the existing Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN). Assessment of the strength of the sites and the network as a whole will be determined through metrics developed in collaboration with the sites and will be based on site usage, site productivity and technical impact, contributions to the network, and education and outreach activity."

Climate change threatens the persistence of many organisms worldwide. Vulnerable species must adapt or migrate to avoid extinction. Species such as plants that are unable to move will face particular challenges when coping with rapid changes in climate. In the meadows of the wildflower capital of Colorado, natural communities of plants are confronting hotter and drier conditions. Drummond's rockcress (Boechera stricta) is native to the Rocky Mountains and can grow at elevations as low as 5,000 feet and higher than 12,000 feet in sites as far north as Alaska and as far south as Arizona. The climate varies dramatically across this broad range, and rockcress plants have developed adaptations that enable them to perform best in their home sites. But can they adapt to the current pace of climate change quickly enough to survive? This research combines large-scale field studies with laboratory experiments to ask whether natural populations have enough genetic diversity to adapt in the short-term to rapidly changing conditions. Populations or species with limited adaptive potential may have to be relocated to more hospitable areas to conserve biodiversity. This project engages high school students, future high school teachers, and undergraduate researchers in the scientific method, increasing scientific literacy, and career opportunities.<br/><br/>Field and laboratory studies use the ecological model species B. stricta to examine: (1) how short-term fitness consequences of climate change influence the migratory and adaptive potential of populations; and (2) how plasticity, adaptation, and gene flow contribute to longer-term population persistence. To achieve these aims, researchers will evaluate how snow pack dynamics and temperatures interact to shape adaptation in nature, analyze the direct and indirect effects of climate on fitness and optimal phenotypes, assess clinal variation in local adaptation, and investigate the stability of the genetic covariance matrix in multiple environments."

The new UAV-­based radio telemetry (UAV-­RT) system will dramatically improve wildlife tracking capability while using inexpensive, commercially available radio tags. The system design will reflect the unique needs of wildlife tracking applications, including easy assembly and repair in the field and reduction of fire risk.

This study will elucidate the key biophysical mechanisms by investigating the biomass characteristics and the dominant physical mechanisms controlling the vertical nutrient delivery associated with Gulf Stream warm core rings.  The improved understanding on nutrient dynamics from this research will contribute to the stewardship of living marine resources, and better ecosystem management.

For better understanding of the relative importance of several mesoscale biophysical processes, the photoautotrophic biomass within the warm core rings will be characterized first using satellite observed sea surface height and chlorophyll concentration. The investigators will then conduct idealized numerical modeling experiments to identify the dominant physical processes responsible for vertical nutrient delivery including vertical mixing and vertical advection induced by frictional decay, eddy-induced Ekman pumping, and wind-sea surface temperature interaction.  The findings from the idealized modeling will be further synthesized in a realistic coupled biophysical model for the Northwest Atlantic region."

Many high altitude animals survive through winter underneath snow that buffers them from extremes of temperature. Many unique and ecologically important animals live in mountainous environments, making it vital to understand and predict impacts of annual differences in snow cover on their population abundances, but as yet we have limited understanding of how snow impacts survival and reproduction of insects and other animals. This project proposes to study physiological and genetic responses to variation in snow cover in a high altitude beetle in the laboratory and the natural environment to understand how snow alters reproductive success during the winter and subsequent summer.  This work will develop a partnership between UC-Berkeley and two Primarily Undergraduate Institutions. Undergraduates at the Primarily Undergraduate Institutions will work with researchers from Berkeley, and Berkeley PhD students will supervise undergraduates from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences. Thus both groups of students will be exposed to the culture of different educational institutions and will have access to professional contacts outside their usual network. A curriculum module developed from the project for K-12 students will be used to contribute towards their understanding of challenges that organisms face in snowy climates, and this module will be distributed to K-12 teachers through a UC Berkeley-based website.<br/><br/>For high altitude animals, summer is a time of energy gain, while energy conservation is key during winter because resources are scarce and animals rely on energy stores. To resist winter cold, high altitude insects use energy stores to synthesize metabolically expensive cryoprotectants. This may generate a trade-off between cold hardiness and energy conservation. Snow buffers thermal fluctuations, decreasing cold mortality and need for cold hardiness.  However, since temperatures are greater beneath snow than in a snow-free, exposed habitat, there may be increased overall energy demand associated with living under snow.  Due to the energetic trade-off, inter-annual fluctuations in winter snowpack and air temperature will alter selective pressures on overwintering organisms, and may significantly affect growth and reproduction in summer. The central hypothesis is that variation in snow cover alters selective pressures on cold hardiness and energy conservation, influencing physiological performance of overwintering individuals and genetic composition of survivors. The investigators further hypothesize that cold hardiness trades off against future reproduction by depleting winter energy reserves due to energetic costs of cold hardiness. The research will: 1) Measure how variation in snow alters selective gradients on winter-relevant genetic variation in a high altitude beetle, and isolate causal drivers of winter selective gradients. 2) Gain a predictive and quantitative understanding of how cold and energy stressors interact to shape physiological performance during winter and the subsequent summer. 3) Uncover mechanisms underlying interactions between cold and energy stress by asking how single or combined stressors alter reaction norms for energy reserves and cryoprotectants."

These single-celled organisms have evolved a range of behaviors for obtaining nutrients from the environment, capturing prey, and evading predators. In this project, the investigators will use a newly developed high-speed microscale imaging system (HSMIS) in the lab and field to characterize dinoflagellate behaviors in unprecedented detail in space and time to understand ecologically important species-species interactions. The goal is to understand the relationships among behavior, morphology, and ecological function for dinoflagellates. More broadly, results will help explain processes that regulate the biomass of, distribution of, and chemical cycling by marine plankton. In addition, the investigators will develop and use a novel technology, provide research training for undergraduate students, and give demonstrations and lectures to the public.<br/><br/>Dinoflagellates are one of the most abundant and ecologically important groups in marine ecosystems, playing diverse roles in marine food webs. These single-celled organisms have evolved an impressive repertoire of sensory, allelochemical, and behavioral capabilities for obtaining nutrients, capturing prey, evading predators, and competing against other organisms. This repertoire remains largely unexplored, however, in part because traditional microscopy limits observations at the relevant scales for the natural behavior of dinoflagellates.  The investigators will conduct a laboratory and field project to use a high-speed microscale imaging system (HSMIS) to characterize dinoflagellate behavior in unprecedented spatial and temporal detail across a range of ecologically important species-species interactions. HSMIS overcomes several limitations inherent to traditional microscopy, such as wall effects due to small sample volumes, confinement to a horizontal field-of-view, and strong convection caused by using strong light. The goal is to achieve a mechanistic understanding of interspecies detection, avoidance, and capture. Observations will span a range of size scales and trophic levels and will include examples of different flagellar propulsive systems. Differences in swimming and flow will be used to understand trade-offs in body form and kinematics for nutrient uptake, resource competition, selective feeding, and predator/parasite avoidance."

However, the economic viability of using algae for these applications heavily depends on the efficiency of growing specific algae types. Custom-designed materials and structures allow for controlled microbiological growth processes that result in increased efficiency in water remediation and energy harvesting. Conventionally, two-dimensional synthetic polymer meshes are employed as the scaffolds for algal attachment and growth. These traditional substrata are not biodegradable, and do not provide the optimal shape or surface characteristics for targeted algal growth. This award supports fundamental research on using additive manufacturing to print biodegradable composite scaffolds from cellulose nanocrystals, naturally abundant materials extracted from waste agricultural and forest products. Research results will help advance the development of more economical and biodegradable routes to grow algae for removing contaminants from water and/or producing energy.  <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to establish a scientific understanding of combined effects of scaffold composition, shape, and texture on algal growth and scaffold biodegradation in water remediation reactors.

Measurement of rheological, thermal, morphological, and contact angle properties will be performed using standard methods. The second objective is to understand the effects of rheological properties (particularly the ratio of the elastic to viscous modulus) of the filaments on the quality (including surface defects) of the scaffolds printed by additive manufacturing (fused deposition modeling).

The algae will then be removed and the mass harvested from different regions recorded. Changes to the scaffold will also be assessed using microscopy and mass measurement."

It is aimed at understanding the behavior of atmospheric regions from the middle atmosphere upward through the ionized upper layers of the atmosphere and into outer space in terms of coupling, energetics, chemistry, and dynamics on regional and global scales. The mid-latitude ionosphere serves as the intermediary between the active ionospheres of the polar and equatorial regions, but it has not been studied very thoroughly. This Collaborative CEDAR award involving University of Texas at Dallas, Virginia Tech University, and the University of Colorado is aimed at developing the first quiet-time empirical model of the ionosphere electric field distribution to fill in the necessary ground truth needed to produce a true understanding of the global dynamics of the ionosphere. The research effort would use 15 years of Air Force Defense Meteorological Space Plasma (DMSP) measurements of ion zonal flow speeds in the mid-latitude ionosphere to construct an empirical model of mid-latitude ionospheric quiet-time electric fields. This data set would be supplemented by ion drift data obtained from the mid-latitude SuperDARN sites. This database would be made available to outside users, and thus, would be a valuable ionospheric community resource. Following the completion of the development of the quiet time model, observations from storm times will be compared to predictions based upon application of the new quiet time model. The determined differences would be analyzed within the guidance and context of the CTIP (Coupled thermosphere ionosphere plasmasphere)-RCM model runs to understand the underlying physical mechanisms causing the observed variability relative to the baseline model established, to quantify the magnitude and extent of storm-time disturbances, and finally, to quantify the coupling of the mid-latitude ion drifts to the neutral atmosphere and the transfer of energy between the polar and equatorial regions. Finally, making use of nearly two decades of DMSP data to understand and develop empirical models goes to the heart of one of the fundamental challenges of the CEDAR Aeronomy program, which is to quantify a baseline model of mid-latitude electric fields. Consequently, the question of variability as a function of solar phase, geomagnetic activity, and dynamical coupling to the lower atmosphere and to the magnetosphere regions can be more carefully assessed. The results achieved would be of great interest and use to the ionosphere and thermospheric modeling community and also relevant to the CEDAR mission of ""understanding the fundamental properties of the space-atmosphere interaction region (SAIR); identify the interconnected processes that define the SAIR's global behavior, evolution, and influence on the Sun-Earth system"".  <br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to quantify the response of the ionosphere relative to direct, spectrally separated measurements of solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation from the TIMED and SDO spacecraft. This approach constitutes an immense improvement over previous studies based on proxies. The C/NOFS and DMSP spacecraft at a range of altitudes will provide corresponding measurements of ionospheric parameters. This dataset, spanning more than a solar cycle, allows for the use of advanced statistical analysis techniques and will be used together with the SAMI-2 model to address outstanding science questions related to understanding the ionospheric response to solar EUV variability. Interesting questions to be investigated include the relative importance of and interaction between the responses in the neutral and ionized components of the upper atmosphere."

To have such a significant impact on the productivity of the deep ocean the off-shelf flows from Patagonia must be large and exhibit a high nutrient content.  The overall goal of this project is to characterize the physical processes underlying the high fertility and high volume transport of Patagonia's outflows. It is hypothesized that the high nutrient content of the Patagonia shelf outflows are partially sustained by a unique shelfbreak upwelling system extending from the Drake Passage to the Brazil/Malvinas Confluence. The hypotheses will be addressed with the analysis of a series of nested high resolution model simulations. This research is relevant to the climate and marine ecosystem community research. Any change in the circulation in the western South Atlantic, nutrient and iron input to the  euphotic zone, continental margin discharge and biological activity will have a substantial effect on the balance of outgassing of natural carbon dioxide and uptake of anthropogenic carbon dioxide.  A close study of the input of iron and its control on the ecosystem will further enlighten us on future changes of carbon dioxide fluxes in these regions. Furthermore, it will provide some insight on which processes and on which scale the climate community model will have to resolve them. The research may also help in the design of future field campaigns to address the unresolved questions of differences in primary production between the Pacific and Atlantic sectors of the Southern Ocean and target sites where observations will provide answers to these questions. Graduate training will also be an important component of this research.<br/><br/>It is hypothesized that this highly productive system is composed of three localized upwelling centers: the first extending along the northern portion of the Patagonian shelfbreak, from 48 S to the Brazil/Malvinas Confluence; the second centered on the Burdwood Bank, a relatively shallow bank located in the northern portion of the Drake Passage; and the third centered on the Malvinas (Falkland) Islands. A second hypothesis is that the large off-shelf flows from Patagonia are driven by interactions between the Antarctic Circumpolar Current (ACC) and the bottom topography in the northern portion of the Drake Passage. To address these hypotheses, several process-oriented numerical experiments will be analyzed. These experiments, which are based on a high-resolution nested model configuration, will also allow an investigation of the impact of sub-mesoscale processes on the regional circulation. There are very few studies on the physical mechanisms sustaining Patagonia's extraordinary shelfbreak blooms and its mass exchanges with the Southern Ocean. In fact, there are no previous studies on the Burdwood Bank and the Malvinas Islands upwelling centers and very few on the exchanges between the Patagonian shelf and the Southern Ocean. There are also no previous studies on the impact of sub-mesoscale processes on the southwestern Atlantic circulation. A pilot study, however, shows that these processes influence important and novel changes within the regional circulation. The numerical experiments to be analyzed by this project are the state-of-the-art for this region.  Some of them are the legacy of previous research efforts by this team, while others will be executed during the course of this program."

Quantitative prognostication of fatigue damage is still a largely unresolved and critical problem of engineering practice. This award supports fundamental research establishing the connection between material fatigue and structural dynamics. Such a link enables fatigue damage modeling and prediction and is an indispensable component of effective structural health monitoring and condition-based maintenance technologies. Successful achievement of the project objectives will enhance safety and performance of critical infrastructure and machinery, and will provide wide-ranging benefits to the U.S. economy and society. The project has a multidisciplinary nature incorporating material science, dynamical systems modeling, fatigue testing, and nonlinear time series analysis. The research approach and the project findings will also enrich engineering education and broaden participation of underrepresented groups in cross-disciplinary research.<br/><br/>Current understanding of fatigue mechanisms at the micro-scale is not sufficient to provide information applicable to macro-scale fatigue life estimation. Furthermore, existing models and analyses of the dynamic behavior of damaged structures do not directly yield insight into fatigue mechanisms or fatigue prediction. This award will support the study of fatigue evolution across its different stages, its interaction with structural dynamics and loads, and the effect of loads on fatigue dynamics. A combination of analytical, numerical, and experimental studies will be conducted to investigate the interaction between fatigue accumulation and structural oscillations. The findings will be employed for practical fatigue life prediction under variable amplitude loading conditions. The project will formulate a modeling approach that permits the exploitation of nonlinear load characteristics for fatigue life prediction. The resulting damage model and method for fatigue life prediction - using new, physically meaningful, and easy to estimate load metrics - will be instrumental in designing against fatigue, and enabling effective fatigue prognostication."

Positive impact in all three of these areas leads to sustainable engineering, such that the needs of the present are met, without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs. Unfortunately, the social elements of engineering decisions -- meaning how they affect the day-to-day quality of life of persons -- have not yet been the focus of significant engineering design research.  As a result, models to help engineers evaluate the social impact of engineering decisions do not yet exist. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) award supports an interdisciplinary study (engineering and sociology) to explore how social impact models can be created for engineered products, how the uncertainty associated with social issues can be included in those models, and how the quality of those models can be judged in a product development setting. Successfully completing the goals of this research will bring US engineers one step closer to sustainable design and engineering.<br/><br/>The concept of social impact is broad, unwieldy, and currently undefined as it relates to engineered products. This research will begin to define the boundaries of social impact as it is influenced by engineering decisions. The research team will perform a number of tasks aimed at accomplishing this, including: (i) identifying social impacts and social influences (i.e., ways social issues can affect the adoption and impact of a product) in the literature and through interactions with industrial partners and their existing products; (ii) integrating and classifying these social impacts and influencers into broad dimensions or issue-areas that are relevant for engineering design; (iii) identifying ethnographic instruments or administrative data for measuring each social impact; and (iv) executing empirical studies to understand modeling formalisms for evaluating the social impact of products. The intellectual merit of the research is to understand the most unknown, uncharacterized, branch of sustainable design -- the social dimension. This research is motivated by the reality that until the social impact of engineered products can be modeled, fully sustainable design is out of reach for the engineering community. Additionally, as engineers become more capable of modeling the social impact of products, the complex tradeoffs between economic, environmental, and social sustainability will begin to dominate the discussion. Successful research by the team will enable product-specific tradeoffs between economic, environmental, and social sustainability to be explored numerically using traditional trade-space exploration methods."

Programs relying on heavy use of insecticides are now used for control. The effectiveness of insecticide-based control strategies is being threatened by the evolution of insecticide resistance. Resistance has increased globally yet the mechanisms behind this spread are still largely unknown. Insecticide application exerts a selection pressure, yet this pressure is not constant in time or space. Additionally, mosquitoes can spread resistance to new areas as populations mix. These mosquitos are a major public health problem as they transmit multiple viral diseases including dengue fever, chikungunya, and zika virus. The research will have notable broader impacts as it informs insecticide resistance management and will be helpful in developing novel mosquito control strategies.<br/>The most common form of insecticide resistance in Aedes aegypti is driven by point mutations in the para-orthologous sodium channel gene, which confers resistance to pyrethroid insecticides. Named kdr for ""knock-down resistance"", these point mutations may carry a fitness cost, rendering the resistant individuals less fit in the absence of insecticide pressure. Variation in the location and timing of urban insecticide applications creates a patchy environment of insecticide-free refuges, where susceptible mosquitoes may gain a fitness advantage, and areas with insecticide, where only resistant mosquitoes survive. There is also variation in the quality of larval habitats, which leads to density-dependent competition between individuals for resources. Under this complex selection scenario, the relative fitness of genotypes may change based on the presence of insecticide or larval density. To better understand these dynamics, researchers will conduct cage experiments under semi-natural conditions to quantify the relative fitness of kdr genotypes exposed to all combinations of two different treatments: with versus without insecticide, and high versus low larval density. These experiments will contribute to understanding the selection dynamics of kdr in Aedes aegypti and help explain patterns of resistance frequencies observed in field populations over space and time."

However, current processing techniques for forming and shaping are limited to elevated temperatures, which drive high production costs and a negative environmental footprint. This award supports fundamental research to provide strategies for producing fracture-resistant Mg alloys, including during forming operations. A key departure from current thinking is to engineer an essential feature of these materials, the directionality of their properties, which is conventionally thought of as deleterious, hence to be mitigated. Accelerated insertion of Mg alloys is potentially transformative in a multi-billion dollar economy of the transportation industry. In addition, use of these lightweight structural materials will lead to reduction in fuel consumption and emissions with a positive impact on the environment, including in manufacturing. The project activities will create an interdisciplinary research environment for both undergraduate and graduate students and investigate teaching methods in processing and manufacturing. <br/><br/>The research will elucidate the relationship between the plastic anisotropy of Mg alloys and their fracture resistance and formability. The underlying hypothesis is that the anisotropy of Mg alloys can be engineered to develop materials with unprecedented strength and ductility. To test the hypothesis, materials sharing the same chemical composition and microstructure but having different textures will be produced in bulk and sheet form and characterized for their plastic strength, formability and fracture properties. A metrics-based methodology will be developed for correlating plastic anisotropy with measures of fracture and formability. Discrete dislocation dynamics, continuum damage mechanics analyses and simulations as well as investigations of microscopic damage mechanisms will be carried out to gain further insight into the success or failure of such correlations. The project will therefore help answer important questions such as: (i) Is material anisotropy intrinsically deleterious? If not, how can it be engineered for enhanced performance? (ii) Does enhanced ductility translate into cost-effective formability? (iii) Are there any achievable textures that result in types of anisotropy that prevent shear failure? (iv) How does the anisotropy manifest at dislocation scales? Inquiry into these issues will follow a holistic approach that brings together materials science, mechanics and manufacturing."

Approximately fifty percent of such susceptible to death circumstances are related to not properly cleaning (or disinfecting) the surfaces such as hospital beds, hospital room floors, and medical devices.  The common disinfectants used are bleach (i.e. sodium hypochlorite), hydrogen peroxide, and salt containing central positively charged nitrogen atom surrounded by four organic groups (or quaternary salts).

Initially, the intensive market evaluation of surface disinfectants will be done, followed by best practice to commercialize the liquid ferrate product as a surface disinfectant for healthcare facilities.  The market evaluation will provide information whether the ferrate technology stands in comparison with currently available market disinfectant products to the health care facility customers.  Finally, the physical properties (i.e., staining of surfaces/clothes/skin, odor) and interactions with hospital materials (e.g., glass, fabric, ceramic, metal, and plastic) will be examined after the ferrate treatment.

Commercially, the ability to dynamically, adaptively and optimally route traffic on data networks will lead to network cost savings ranging from 60% - 70% for network service providers. Critically, the project leverages the recent industry shift towards software-defined networking (SDN) that is projected to become a $45 billion market by 2020. The excitement behind SDN is driven primarily by the promised performance benefits of better traffic control. By bringing to market its provably optimal, dynamic and adaptive traffic control algorithms, the company will be uniquely positioned to capitalize on this market opportunity. The immediate resulting social impact will be that end users will have access to faster, cheaper and more robust data networks. In the longer term, efficient software control of networks will enable rapid innovation in networking leading to new network applications that have not even been envisioned yet. The project also enhances technological and scientific understanding by commercially verifying the company's solution to a longstanding open problem in networking - namely, whether an easy to deploy, dynamic, adaptive and optimal routing algorithm can be found.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project focuses on delivering commercial, smart, traffic control algorithms that can unlock the full capacity of modern communications networks. Today, due to unprecedented traffic growth, network operators face major challenges in the form of efficient resource utilization. The problem is that the inherent randomness of data traffic has led to network designers over-provisioning networks to the point where they run at 30% - 40% utilization on average. The company's competitive advantage is a new algorithm that allows it to optimally manage traffic variations by adjusting network routes in real time while retaining the scalability and simplicity of today's protocols. The goal in this project is to build on the beta tests from Phase I by developing an enterprise-grade, cloud-based network control application that is ready for general market launch. To this end, the company will start with small commercial deployments at selected test partners. Feedback from these deployments will be used to iron out any issues before general market launch. By the end of the project, the company anticipates generating significant revenue from initial customers as it continues to innovate and maintain its current lead in developing SDN control plane software."

This heating of seawater to temperatures as high as 400°C, as it circulates through the ocean crust, results in extensive chemical reactions that modify the fluid's composition to something that is acidic, metal- and sulfide-rich, and highly reducing. Venting of these fluids at the seafloor and mixing with seawater creates a chemical environment that supports large microbial ecosystems that do not rely on the sun (photosynthesis) as a source of energy. Instead, they are sustained by catalyzing chemical reactions that occur when hot and reduced hydrothermal fluids mix with cold oxidized seawater. The ability of microbes to utilize these reactions as an energy source is highly dependent on the abundance and composition of chemical compounds that participate in these types of oxidation-reduction reactions. This research conducts laboratory experiments to determine the rate of abiotic (i.e., not involving life) chemical reactions that produce or consume chemical compounds used by deep sea microbes. These data improve our understanding of how subsurface microbes and the higher order marine ecosystems, that rely on these microbes as the base of the food web, thrive on the bottom of the seafloor thousands of feet below the sea surface. Broader impacts of the work include a substantial educational component that provides state-of-the-art research experiences for 25 undergraduate science majors at a primarily undergraduate institution (Bridgewater State University) through partnership with a major oceanographic research institution (the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution). This integration of research and education includes the development and implementation of a research course, offered at Bridgewater State, and intensive summer research experiences at Woods Hole. The goal is to provide undergraduates with opportunities to experience all aspects of the scientific process, including background research, data collection, analysis and interpretation, and presentation of results at a national conference in order to better prepare them for employment and graduate study.<br/><br/>This research consists of laboratory experiments that investigate abiotic redox reactions in subsurface mixing zones in seafloor hydrothermal systems. Using a novel laboratory reactor, experiments investigate chemical disequilibria between key redox reactive species in seawater (e.g., H2, H2S, Fe2+, CH4, O2, SO42-, CO2, NO3-), which comprise a major source of chemical energy that supports complex subsurface ecosystems. At present, such reactions are poorly constrained in hydrothermal environments, so this work identifies these reactions and determines their rates at low to moderate temperatures that characterize subsurface mixing zones within hydrothermal systems. The resulting data will allow improvement of models of hydrothermal vent microbial metabolic pathways. Experiments will take place using an open-system flow-through reaction cell that is able to regulate the concentration of H2, O2, H2S, NO3-, and intermediate oxidation state sulfur and nitrogen species as a function of temperature and pH. Data will be used to place fundamental constraints on thermodynamic models used to predict the amount of chemical energy delivered to vent ecosystems, which should lead to an improved understanding of the linkages between chemical environment and biological community composition and function."

The doctoral student will seek to determine whether ice margins behaved synchronously in the region and whether they reached their maximum extent before or during the time known as the Little Ice Age from about 1300 to 1900.  A more precise determination of when the southern Greenland ice sheet reached its maximum extent will provide new information and insights regarding broader hemispheric climate dynamics.  If the southern Greenland ice margins reached their maximum extent during the Little Ice Age at the same time as glacial margins in Europe and North America, then the southern Greenland ice sheet likely behaved in concert with a hemispheric wide climate signal.  This finding would suggest that current southern Greenland ice sheet retreat might be in response to warming trends around the globe in recent centuries that are influencing ice retreat in Europe and North America.  If the southern Greenland ice sheet reached its maximum before the Little Ice Age, however, a more complex set of explanations for why ice margins in different parts of the Northern Hemisphere reached their maxima during different time periods will be required.  Identification of an earlier maximum also would require reconsideration of dynamics affecting the southern Greenland ice sheet itself, because its margins may stabilize in the future as climate models predict minimal warming over this part of Greenland in the coming century.  Project findings will be shared more broadly with school groups and the public through education and museum programs.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>The doctoral student will date the retreat of two southern Greenland ice sheet outlet glaciers using cosmogenic surface exposure ages on boulders from moraines that are dated as being more than 300 years in age. `These results will be compared with existing data from a pilot study and new data to the north of these locations. In the end, four different ice margins in southern Greenland will be dated, thereby allowing the testing of spatial and temporal variability in the southern Greenland ice sheet.  The student will address two fundamental research questions.  (1) When was the late-Holocene maximum of the southern Greenland ice sheet?  Regarding this question, the student will test the hypothesis that the late-Holocene maximum underwent a late-Holocene advance more extensive than its Little Ice Age advance in response to significant early cooling.  (2) Does regional climate govern southern Greenland ice sheet variability at centennial timescales?  The student will address this question by testing the hypothesis that the southern Greenland ice sheet responds synchronously to centennial climate variations, such as those observed during the late Holocene. Testing these hypotheses will shed light on geologically recent ice sheet-climate interactions important for modeling the Greenland ice sheet response to spatially variable temperature changes.  Project results will determine if southern GIS margins have responded to climatic changes of less than several degrees on a timescale relevant to humanity?s near-term future, a potentially transformative result, particularly for predicting sea-level rise over the coming century."

Jaw-muscle fiber types play an important role in fine-tuning the jaw muscles for specific motor tasks such as chewing and powerful biting. This research will study jaw-muscle fiber types across a range of primate species and use those data to test three hypotheses about the evolution of jaw muscle patterns in primates. Results of this work will provide new insights into the relationship between muscle and diet by i) increasing knowledge about the behavioral and ecological factors that shape feeding-system anatomy; ii) advancing our understanding of how jaw-muscle fiber types and whole muscle anatomy work together to generate the jaw movements and jaw forces necessary during feeding and aggressive biting; and (iii) refining models of chewing biomechanics in living and fossil primates. A central component of this work includes the training and mentoring of undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, including women and underrepresented minorities, in state-of-the-art methods for muscle fiber typing.  In addition, results will be incorporated in community outreach programs aimed at exposing primary school girls to science.  Lastly, this project will generate a unique collection of digital images and slides of muscle tissue that will be made available to the scientific community for teaching and research.<br/><br/>The jaw-closing muscles are the motors of the masticatory system.  Collectively, these muscles are responsible for generating the jaw movements and forces associated with feeding behaviors as well as non-feeding oral behaviors such as aggressive biting and wide-mouth opening for canine threat display. While fiber architecture is an important determinant of whole muscle function, its functional and adaptive significance cannot be fully appreciated in the absence of information on fiber type. This lack of data on primate fiber phenotype limits 1) knowledge about variation in jaw-muscle fiber phenotype; 2) the functional significance of this variation for behavior and performance; and 3) the specificity with which we can model and test hypotheses of feeding-system function and performance in both living and fossil species. To provide a more complete framework for linking measures of primate masticatory anatomy and physiology with function and performance, the investigators will collect and analyze novel data on jaw-muscle fiber type composition and distribution in select, closely related species of strepsirrhine and anthropoid primates that diverge in a key feeding or biting behavior. The data collected will be used to: (i) quantify the myosin heavy chain (MHC) fiber type composition and distribution in primate jaw-closing muscles using state-of-the-art immunohistochemistry; (ii) test three key functional and adaptive hypotheses that have been advanced to explain the evolution of fiber phenotype in mammalian jaw muscles:  the frequent recruitment hypothesis, the aggressive bite hypothesis, and the high occlusal force hypothesis; and (iii) assess the correspondence among fiber phenotype, fiber architecture and leverage with the goal of refining models of masticatory biomechanics. This project will provide novel data on the contractile proteins found in primate jaw-closing muscles, advance knowledge of the ecological and behavioral factors that drove changes in the primate jaw-muscle fiber phenotype, and yield new insights into how key components of feeding-system morphology such as fiber architecture, fiber phenotype and leverage combine to facilitate or constrain feeding behavior in primates, including species that have been advanced as models for interpreting feeding behavior and diet in early human ancestors."

The remarkable catalytic activities of enzymes frequently derive from the properties of a metal atom within the enzyme. Typically, studies of how these metalloenzymes function rely on trapping the enzyme in different intermediate states, a process that cannot always reveal the entire enzyme mechanism.  Single-molecule measurements, i.e. studies performed on one molecule at a time, are powerful tools for understanding function because they allow one to acquire ""molecular movies"" of chemical behavior. However, metalloenzymes cannot be examined by state-of-the-art single-molecule techniques, necessitating the development of a new instrument. The use of optical microresonators, devices that confine light to a small microvolume, will enable the measurement of time-resolved behavior and deduce the mechanism of an individual working metalloenzyme. The results of this work will be a new tool capable of providing unique information on a broad range of enzymes critical for biological and industrially relevant chemical transformations. Simultaneously, the educational experience for participating students will be highly multidisciplinary, incorporating elements of photonics, instrumentation, nanofabrication, and bioinorganic chemistry. This project will also include the development of biophotonics teaching modules, participation of undergraduate students under-represented in STEM fields, and undergraduate students at a PUI.         <br/><br/>This purpose of this project is to develop a spectrometer capable of measuring time-resolved electronic absorption spectra of individual biomolecules. The proposed research will benefit the large scientific community studying metalloenzymes.  Enzymes are the biological machines that support nearly all metabolic activity in biological organisms. At the heart of nearly half of these machines is a metal ion that facilitates protein function. These metalloenzymes go through multiple individual kinetic steps in order to carry out their function, including electron transfer events and ligand binding and dissociation. It is of immense mechanistic interest to establish the nature and timescale of these individual events in the enzyme's catalytic cycle. Single-molecule measurements offer the unique ability to construct 'molecular movies' of enzymes performing their natural functions. These measurements are extremely powerful for enabling a greater understanding of how enzymes function since each step can potentially be observed. However, even as modern single-molecule techniques have enabled critical details of many enzymes to be unraveled, current methods for performing measurements on individual molecules fail to provide useful information about the metal site in metalloenzymes, essentially remaining blind to the most important mechanistic details of metalloenzyme mode of operation. This proposal concerns the development of a new technique to allow single-molecule investigation of the active sites of metalloenzymes. Specifically, we will develop optical microresonators as highly sensitive thermometers capable of measuring the heat released from a single photoexcited biomolecule. Once this heat is quantified, one can infer how much light was absorbed, allowing the construction of the electronic absorption spectrum of the active site. This spectrum, which varies as a function of time as the metalloenzyme carries out its function, contains a tremendous amount of information about the changing nature of the metal site, including its redox state and coordination environment. This new technique will open up a substantial fraction of a critical biomolecule class to be probed at the single molecule level, enabling new opportunities for a large community of researchers."

This framework will be broadly applicable, so it can analyze any group of organisms, and will include good documentation for the user-friendly interface, designed to be immediately accessible instead of requiring extensive training. The project will develop an online game based on the research framework and data that will be used to educate students and interested members of the public about the basic concepts of metabolic activities and metabolic evolution.

Finally, the educational game will be used during the two-day Engineering Challenges in the Science and Math Investigative Learning Experiences (SMILE) Program to provide an interactive learning experience for high-school students. The computational tools and the educational gaming system will be released through public web servers and software repositories, and the research outcomes from this project will be disseminated through open-source documentations, journal publications, and conference presentations.<br/><br/> The genome-scale models (GEMs) of metabolic networks have broad applications in phenotype prediction, evolutionary reconstruction, functional analysis, and metabolic engineering. Despite the reconstruction of over 100 GEMs in public literature, significant challenge remains in integrating the heterogeneous information about genes, proteins, reactions and metabolites into a comprehensive understanding of the associations between genome diversity and metabolic plasticity. To solve this problem, this research will focus on constructing a new computational infrastructure that combines the simulation of GEMs with the analysis of pan-genomes (i.e. an ensemble of genomes from any given group of organisms). The computational infrastructure will include a user-friendly interface that supports the collaborative construction, annotation, and quality checking of metabolic models. It will also enable the identification of genome-wide metabolic variations by providing new algorithms for GEM comparison and pan-genome analysis. Specifically, this project will focus on achieving three aims: (1) implement a new data format that will integrate heterogeneous information into the construction of metabolic models; (2) build a computational tool that will support the comparative analysis of metabolic networks; (3) develop a new algorithm that will improve the efficiency of ortholog mapping in pan-genome analysis and permit the comparison of metabolic variants among different organisms.

And while critical advances have been made in understanding the marine iron cycle, a full description remains elusive due to its biogeochemical complexity and the low concentrations of iron in the ocean. The research funded in this project seeks to advance our understanding of the chemical forms of Fe in seawater. This will be done by first refining a novel, selective electrochemical analytical method for looking at Fe at natural concentrations in seawater and then relating the resulting data to the genetic composition of the microbial communities responsible for creating the organic molecules that control the fate and chemical form of Fe in the ocean. We now know that iron is an incredibly important micronutrient to biological communities, and this new approach of linked genomic and analytical data has the potential to provide important insights that will significantly advance the study of iron composition in the ocean. This project will also support two graduate students at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, both participating in a new outreach program with 6th graders initiated by the Birch Aquarium at Scripps. <br/><br/>The importance of iron as a limiting micronutrient in the ocean has become a topic of avid research, and there have been many advances in the field. However, characterizations of iron speciation in seawater are still broad by nature due to the lack of precision in the electrochemical analytical techniques.  Competitive ligand exchange - adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (CLE-ACSV) has been a commonly used technique to study iron speciation in seawater. This research seeks to improve this method by applying CLE-ACSV at multiple analytical windows (MAW) to increase resolution at the strong and weak ends of the iron-binding ligand spectrum. Additionally, by relating data from this technique to data on the metagenomic composition of the resident microbial community, the work should be able to make meaningful connections between the microbial communities that produce the organic ligands that we now know dominate iron speciation, solubility, and uptake in the ocean. This research has the potential to make a significant contribution to the current understanding of iron cycling in seawater, and it will help us to better understand the larger global ocean biogeochemical processes that control the distribution and availability of iron and its controls on global productivity."

In general, the PI views the politics of immigration as the tug of war between voters who oppose low-skilled workers on various grounds and firms who favor foreign labor. In contrast to much of the existing literature on immigration that tends to focus on native voters' preferences for immigration, the PI focuses on the role of labor-intensive firms in immigration policymaking. He classifies firms into two broad categories, firms that face competition in the international goods market (tradable sector) and firms that offer domestic services that cannot be traded (non-tradable sector). The PI argues that firms in the tradable sector are much more likely to support more open immigration policy and identify two factors that explain the decline of pro-immigration firms: a sudden windfall from capital-intensive natural resources, such as oil and natural gas, and increasing competition in the global goods market. Using new data on immigration policy and field research in the Netherlands and Scandinavia, the PI demonstrates that his theoretical framework is not limited to the U.S. and Canada but is generalizable across a variety of cases. He also finds that a country's immigration policy does not generally respond to short-term labor needs or unorganized native opposition, but merely reflects the relative political power of pro- or anti-immigration groups.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>The project takes advantage of newly assembled data on immigration policies of wealthy economies around the world. Following the existing literature, the PI classifies immigration policy into more than a dozen policy dimensions, including citizenship regime, restrictions on inflows, and immigrant rights. The PI uses a principal component analysis to extract two factors scores, one that measures the policy restrictive of immigration entry and the other that measures the scope of immigrant rights. Using the time-series cross-sectional data on immigration policy, he runs a set of ordinary least squares analyses to test the effects of trade liberalization and natural resource booms on immigration policy development. To complement the statistical analyses in the project, he uses in-depth interviews and archival research for the culturally and politically similar welfare states in the Netherlands and Scandinavia while incorporating country-specific political institutions into the qualitative research. This study sheds light on what preferences firms hold toward immigration and how they seek to influence immigration policy making in the absence of institutionalized lobbying."

In addition to talks by experts in the field, the workshop includes a mini-course accessible to non-experts, including junior researchers, that covers recent progress in double affine Hecke algebras and related areas. <br/><br/>Hecke algebras of finite and affine Weyl groups arise naturally as convolution algebras associated to finite and locally compact groups, and they play a prominent role in the representation theory of finite groups of Lie type and of reductive p-adic groups. In the early 1990's a class of algebras, known as double affine Hecke algebras, was introduced in connection with affine quantum Knizhnik-Zamolodchikov equations. Since then, profound connections have been discovered between double affine Hecke algebras and a broad spectrum of areas in mathematics, including combinatorics, algebraic geometry, number theory, representation theory, harmonic analysis, knot theory, special functions, many body problems, and conformal field theory. Recent results hint at a new and promising connection between double affine Hecke algebras and Lie superalgebras and open the door to many intriguing possibilities that will be explored at the workshop.

This cost is primarily associated with generation of silicon powder which is a waste stream and requires energy intensive recycling strategies. Thinner wires can lead to minimal powder generation during wire sawing. However, thinner steel wires (smaller than 100 microns in diameter) break easily under the stress required for efficient cutting of silicon. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports scientific investigations on the use of carbon fiber wires smaller than 100 microns in diameter in diamond coated wire sawing of silicon ingots into wafers. Research results from this project will lead to reduced wastage of silicon and, therefore, reduced dollar-per-watt of silicon based solar cells. <br/><br/>The first research objective is to establish relationships between sawing conditions (such as wire velocity and normal force) and the chemical and structural changes of individual diamond particles coated on a carbon fiber wire. The changes observed in the diamond particles are softening (i.e., graphitization), cleavage, blunting, or complete removal from the carbon fiber wire. The approach to achieve this objective is to measure chemical and structural changes after sawing in diamond particles, carbon fiber wire, and generated silicon powder using micro-Raman spectroscopy. This technique can map chemical and structural changes in the diamond particles, carbon fiber wire and the silicon powder with micron scale spatial resolution. An industrial sawing machine, and single crystalline silicon ingots with a 15 cm x 15 cm square cross-section, will be used for sawing experiments. Wire velocities of up to 25 m/s and a normal force of up to 15 N will be used. The second research objective is to understand the effects of wear of diamond particles and carbon fiber on sawing rate. The approach to achieve this objective is to measure, in situ, wire bowing of the diamond coated carbon fiber wire as it performs sawing. This allows estimation of wire tension and frictional forces experienced by the wire inside the silicon kerf during sawing. As wear proceeds, wire bowing increases and so do frictional forces. Sawing rate will be measured as the vertical velocity of the silicon ingot as it presses down on the wire. Parameters such as carbon fiber wire diameter (from 60 µm to 100 µm) and diamond size (from 6 µm to 20 µm) will be varied."

Hence every living thing on this isolated archipelago has origins elsewhere. This project will investigate the origins of Hawaiian reef fishes, which are important both as a food source and a cultural touchstone in native Hawaiian communities. Two prominent hypotheses maintain that marine fish originally arrived from the south (Line Islands and Johnston Atoll) or from the west (Japan). To test these hypotheses, this research will augment existing specimens from Hawaii with expeditions to Johnston Atoll (closest shallow habitat to the south), the northern Line Islands (Palmyra), southern Line Islands (Christmas Island), and Ryukyu Islands and Ogasawara Islands in Japan. Advanced genetic techniques will be used to resolve the closest relatives to the Hawaiian fish species and the pathways by which reef species colonize Hawaii and help establish patterns of biodiversity. In cases where Hawaiian species are closely related to widespread sister species, this project will detect hotspots of genetic divergence. Because this research will reveal the sources of Hawaiian marine biodiversity, results can be used to help define priorities for reef protection. The project will support two graduate students and train at least two more in all aspects of the project from rebreather diving, specimen collection and curation, information management, and advanced genetic techniques. There will be outreach efforts to schools through existing programs, and expedition teams will include a videographer to provide footage for the award-winning Voice of the Sea program, broadcast locally. Expeditions will also include an outreach specialist to handle media reports and promote awareness and concern for reefs in the communities surrounding study sites. <br/><br/>The investigators will sample a suite of 20 reef fishes at locations to the south  (Johnston and Line Islands) and west (Ogasawara and Ryukyu Islands) of Hawaii to resolve the origins of Hawaiian biodiversity. The investigators will employ both population genetics (shifts in genotype frequencies) and phylogenetics (DNA sequence divergence) for more ancient separations to test their hypotheses.  Restriction-digest associated DNA sequencing (RAD-seq) will be employed for the phylogeography, phylogenetics, and population biology studies because it provides high coverage of homologous portions of the genome from multiple individuals for comparatively low cost and effort."

It can also enable researchers to explore new material compositions leading to customized novel properties. To ensure quality of components in laser melting (one of the additive manufacturing processes) and reduce the lead time, it is critical to be able to evaluate material microstructure changes in response to the dynamic high thermal gradient in the process, and the strength of constructed materials under static and dynamic loads after the process. This award supports fundamental research to enable modeling and simulation methods that allow for realistic predictions, process design and optimization, and equipment design of laser melting additive process. The obtained knowledge provides the foundation for researchers and manufacturers to engineer new materials in small lot size at low cost by using laser melting additive process. It can also contribute to understanding the behavior of a broad range of materials in laser melting. Research results will enhance current engineering courses, and provide cross-disciplinary training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>The research objectives are to: (1) acquire knowledge on the mechanism of non-equilibrium solidification in laser melting, (2) determine the effects of non-uniform cyclic thermal history due to multilayer construction on microstructure changes, and (3) establish the relationship between the microstructure resulted from laser melting and the material performances. To achieve the first objective, a thermo-mechanical finite element analysis will be constructed to simulate the material addition process of laser melting, a phase-field approach will be created to calculate the time-dependent growth of alloy phase field based on the computed thermal history, and single-pass and multilayer laser melting experiments will be conducted on a medium carbon steel. The correlation between high thermal gradients from computation and the solute trapping phenomenon from experimental observation will be made to reveal the non-equilibrium solidification mechanism. To achieve the second objective, the microstructure evolutions under both single pass and multilayer laser melting processes are compared using the phase field approach, and verified by experiments. Microstructure variations in terms of grain size, phase composition and distribution will be obtained, resulting from different thermal histories of material points. To achieve the third objective, the analytical models for estimating strengths will be established based on the obtained material microstructure, and the fatigue crack initiation life will be estimated based on the minimum energy principle applied when a crack is created along the weakest material point and path."

High litigation costs in patent infringement cases favor licensing agreements and financial settlements, regardless of the actual merits of the case. Some argue that non-practicing entities, who have no production interests, harm innovative activity though aggressive licensing and costly litigation.  Others believe that non-practicing entities facilitate innovation by licensing to companies that develop and manufacture new products, creating jobs and economic growth. This research will survey companies to gain information on the true value of patent licensing, with a focus on licenses from non-practicing entities. Data will be collected on how often licensing actually leads to innovation, technology transfer, and new technical knowledge.  The results will inform patent reform as Congress and numerous state legislatures require reliable to maintain the strength of American innovation system.  <br/><br/>Detailed company surveys are among the best options for eliciting new information in patent policy research, given that most patent disputes do not progress to the litigation stage and therefore are not captured in existing legal databases. In fact, some 90% of patent enforcement activity may take place outside of court proceedings. Further, companies are unwilling to discuss agreements publicly because of non-disclosure agreements and fears of retaliation. This research will result in the creation of a large data set that can be used for other projects focusing on patent licensing and royalty agreements.  <br/>"

In recent years, archaeologists world-wide have re-opened the debate on how past societies were organized, questioning the validity of assuming that all prehistoric rulers had robust top-down powers within highly hierarchic societies. McDonald, using prehistoric and early historic Ireland as a case study, will assess these relationships through analysis of pollen from bogs near archaeological sites from relevant periods: the Late Bronze Age (11th to 9th centuries BCE), Iron Age (9th cent. BCE to 5th cent. CE), and Early Medieval Period (post 5th cent. CE). In many regions of the developing world today centralized political power is limited and social order is maintained through negotiation across a hierarchical power structure. This research has the potential to provide insight into how such a process functioned across time.<br/><br/>In comparison with earlier and later periods, the Iron Age saw unusual peaks in ritual activity at elite civic-ceremonial sites, and increased evidence for metal production, acquisition and trade, all suggesting major socio-political reorganization. The complex politics of the Iron Age are the focus of many Early Medieval Irish sagas, yet the reality of the Iron Age is poorly understood due to a lack of archaeological sites other than political and ceremonial hubs. The number of known Iron Age settlements expanded during the late 20th century Irish economic boom, yet little is understood about how the society worked. <br/><br/>Were peaks and lulls in activity at political centers paralleled by increases in workload and effort in farming and herding communities? If so, farmers might have been called to produce more for tribute or taxes to support an elite. If not, the reach of government was less than is often assumed. If there are parallels, the directionality and timing of change is important. It is commonly assumed that rulers command increased production, but it can also be the case that pre-existing productivity among farmers enables the rise of elites.<br/><br/>To compensate for gaps in archaeological knowledge, these research questions are approached through analysis of ancient pollen, drawn from stratified, datable cores close to archaeological sites. Pollen grains, resistant to decay, continuously accumulate in the Irish Midlands peat bogs, preserving long chronological sequences. McDonald, a trained palynologist, will identify pollen types and frequency through high-powered microscopy, and samples will be dated through tephrochronology and AMS 14C dating of plant macrofossils. Resulting data enables reconstruction of climate, environmental conditions, and increases and decreases in plants associated with crop cultivation and pasturage at each settlement locale. <br/><br/>In addition to information on the relationship between governments and taxpayers, the project will create a series of classroom lesson plans and YouTube videos aimed at elementary and middle school children, introducing archaeological methods and past cultures, enhancing competencies in science, social studies, math, and language arts."

The end-products of decomposition serve as nutrients in the soil that, along with water, can be taken up by plants directly through their root systems.  By contrast, deserts and other arid ecosystems have to play by a different set of rules.  The lack of water means that plants are far more patchy in their distribution and grow in brief spurts following rare precipitation events.  Between plant patches, a crust often forms consisting of surface-layer bacteria, fungi, lichens, and mosses.  Soil crust fungi have extensions called hyphae that can make connections between crusted areas and plants.  This project will examine implications of the ""fungal loop hypothesis"", which posits that subsurface fungal hyphae provide a network between plants and soil crusts that conserves and transports water and nutrients to plants.  To test aspects of this hypothesis, researchers on this project will conduct field research at three different sites: the Chihuahuan Desert near El Paso, TX, the Colorado Plateau near Moab, UT, and a site between those, near Albuquerque, NM. At these sites, they will study the movement of water and nutrients through fungal hyphae and develop a framework for understanding when and where the fungal loop is most important. Drylands cover about 40% of Earth's surface and play essential roles in the planet's overall response to environmental change. The multi-site, field-intensive design of this project will also enable research and training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students at two diverse institutions: the University of Texas at El Paso (UTEP) and the University of New Mexico (UNM).<br/><br/>The overall objective of this study is to test the fungal loop hypothesis by studying C and N translocation and retention across representative dryland sites. Using a set of field experiments at three sites, this project will address three questions: (1) How do translocation rates (i.e. transfer of C and N between plants and biocrusts through fungal hyphae) vary among dryland sites, plant species, and biocrust types? (2) Does translocation improve growth, productivity and retention of C and N for plants and biocrusts? (3) Are translocation rates determined by the stoichiometric requirements of plants and biocrusts? The proposed work will generate a predictive framework for when and where translocation of C and N between plants and biocrusts is greatest by examining translocation rates using isotopic tracers in a variety of plant and biocrust functional groups at each site (e.g., C3 vs. C4 grasses) and incorporating seasonal variation, especially to contrast spring and monsoonal growing seasons. The work will also examine the importance of translocation by experimentally severing hyphal connections and measuring the effects on plant and biocrust health as well as retention of C and N in the ecosystem. Finally, to address the mechanism of translocation, the investigators will test the hypothesis that stoichiometric gradients drive C and N movement through fungal hyphae by experimentally manipulating C and N gradients and observing the effects on the horizontal movement of C and N, also with the use of isotopic tracers. This research approach will allow for an unprecedented evaluation of the extent to which fungi are the key regulators of C and N cycling in dryland soils as suggested by the fungal loop hypothesis."

Currently, manual WC prescription and fitting are iterative processes and are highly dependent on the expertise of the clinician. Poor outcomes negatively impact the health and wellbeing of the patient as well as significantly increase costs. Clinicians need to prescribe and personalize the configuration of an individual's manual wheelchair so that the fit facilitates function, especially for individuals with spinal cord injury. Functional needs include maintenance of posture, control of balance, distribution of pressure, and mitigation of detrimental loading of the individual's shoulders. This project's System for Personalizing and Evaluating the Fit of Assistive Devices in a Clinical Setting (SPEC) integrates low-cost emerging technology, extensive clinical expertise, and rehabilitation research to inform and personalize the WC prescription and fitting process. Successful integration of the SPEC system into the clinical work-flow is expected to shift clinical practice toward more personalized manual WC fitting while minimizing iterations and costs associated with WC prescription, configuration, and unintended secondary consequences.<br/><br/>This I-Corps team's interviews to date indicate that clinicians need a quick and reliable process that will reduce the trial and error associated with prescribing and personalizing the configuration of manual WCs.

Potential customer segments include clinicians involved in seating, manual wheelchair manufacturers and their suppliers and distributors, and insurance companies who might be the actual payers for utilization of the SPEC system. Revenue structures and product channels may be unique to each of these customer segments. Expected outcomes of this project include further delineation of customer segment value propositions and revenue streams associated with the integration of the SPEC system into the clinical workflow. Broader impact includes translation of research-based guidelines into practice for different customer segments, personalization of therapeutic interventions, and dissemination of expert knowledge into community based practices."

Peanut is polyploid and originated relatively recently in evolutionary time from hybridization between two diploid species, followed by chromosome doubling.  This domestication bottleneck limits variation among genes for resistance to most pests and diseases.  Advances in breeding methods have resulted in the development of synthetic polyploids from the ancestral diploid species of peanut.  Crossing and backcrossing synthetic polyploids with cultivated lines allows transfer of chromosomal segments carrying desirable traits to the cultivated genome.  Given that the majority of peanuts are produced in developing countries and that potential for yield gains based on genetic improvement is large, the long-term impact on production of this nutritious crop will be substantial.  Partnership with the Senegalese Institute for Agricultural Research will ensure that the outputs of this project reach smallholder farmers given their current inclusion in a network that is being used both for evaluation and pre-diffusion of the most promising germplasm.  Well characterized germplasm also will be made available to breeding programs around the world.<br/><br/>Cultivated peanut (Arachis hypogaea L.) is an important food and oil crop in the U.S. and internationally, particularly for small holder farmers.  The allotetraploid cultivated species (2n = 4x = 40; AABB genomes) originated from two diploid species, A. duranensis (AA) and A. ipaensis (BB), has very low levels of DNA polymorphism, and only moderate levels of resistance to most pests and diseases.  However, several diploid (2n = 2x = 20) Arachis species have extremely high levels of resistance or immunity to the most important diseases of peanut.  Objectives of this project are to hybridize four A-genome disease-resistant species with two diploid B- and one K-genome species. The B- and K-genomes are recently described cytological variants of the B genome that likely have different recombination potentials with cultivated peanut.  Synthetic tetraploids will be produced from twelve interspecific hybrid combinations and then hybridized with peanut cultivars so that selections can be made for early and late leaf spots, rust, other pathogen resistances, drought tolerance, and favorable pod and haulm traits.  In addition, advanced generation interspecific hybrids from four AABB synthetics will be field tested in Africa for these same traits.  Taking advantage of the expanding genomic resources for peanut, sequence-based genotyping will be conducted to survey allelic diversity between parental lines, to confirm the hybrid nature of crosses and backcrosses, to characterize introgressions during backcrossing, and to select for QTL conferring leaf spot and rust resistance and drought tolerance along with pod and haulm traits.  It is expected that genotyping and phenotyping information generated will contribute to QTL and gene discovery bearing significance for peanut improvement in traits relevant to smallholder agriculture in Africa and other peanut growing regions of the world.  These proposed activities will advance knowledge of peanut genetics, evolutionary relationships within the genus, genome structure and gene function enabling a more systematic approach for introgression of wild alleles into cultivated germplasm.  Project activities will involve graduate and undergraduate students and provide an active learning environment with emphasis on modern plant breeding and genomics."

A temperature gradient across the microflier chassis drives a net flow of air from hot to cold side, and lift is generated by momentum transfer from this flow to the microflier body. Known as ""radiometric force,"" this effect has been an object of study by physicists and fluid dynamicists for over a century, but only recently has a comprehensive understanding begun to emerge. Though too weak to affect larger objects at atmospheric pressures, radiometric forces scale advantageously for characteristic lengths less than a millimeter. Together with advances in fabrication of micro electro mechanical systems (MEMS), laser-driven opto-radiometric microfliers have the potential to push the envelope of human controlled flight to unprecedented levels of miniaturization. This project will advance towards that goal, with complementary theoretical and experimental components. The results will pave the way for a new class of aerial microrobots with applications such as surveillance, microassembly, airborne pollution monitoring and airborne threat detection.<br/><br/>Despite the existence of microscale flying insects, aerial microrobots have not been previously investigated. Thermal (radiometric) forces have been shown to move micron-sized particles in air, and radiometric forces caused by optical heating of light-absorbing structures have been studied since the invention of the Crookes Radiometer in 1873. This project will validate the feasibility of achieving untethered, controlled opto-radiometric microscale flight, i.e. flight propelled by forces generated via a thermal gradient from a focused optical beam illuminating untethered microfabricated structures. The research team will develop new theory of opto-radiometric microscale flight at atmospheric pressures, investigate novel materials and microfabrication processes that increase the opto-radiometric power transfer without increasing the microflier mass, fabricate and test prototypes of untethered microscale flying robots using a combination of microfabrication technologies and 2-photon stereolithography, and investigate biologically-inspired mechanism for attaining in-flight stability and control."

Brittle behavior and friction laws that describe slip over fractured or rough fault surfaces do not account for the fact that fault zones can simultaneously break in a brittle manner and flow in a ductile way as has been observed in the geologic record. This project combines laboratory experiments and theoretical analysis on the effect a semi-brittle material can have on the mechanisms of deformation localization and slip accumulation, which may provide critical insights on the mechanics of earthquakes.<br/><br/>This project proposes that the wide variation in deformation speeds from earthquake to steady creep can be explained by the interaction of brittle fracturing and ductile flow in a semi-brittle material.  This behavior will be explored with physical experiments using Carbopol, which exhibits both brittle and ductile deformation simultaneously. The experiments will test whether the interaction of tensional and shear fractures in a semi-brittle material leads to strain transients, or if, alternatively, the re-occurring strain transients are controlled by the strength along the shear fracture such that the formation of the fractures only appears to be concurrent with the slip.  The results will be incorporated into an analytical model, which allows extrapolating the results to time scales relevant to strain transients in Earth. The work proposed here will fundamentally advance the understanding of semi-brittle deformation and its impact on strain transients.<br/>"

The project will seek to understand how the presence of the Indonesian islands, as well as the mountains on those islands, influence the motion of the weather disturbances: what causes the disturbances either to move across the islands or not do so, and how that motion can be forecast better. <br/><br/>The project will do this two ways. First,  idealized sensitivity experiments will be performed using models. For example, the islands will be removed entirely, or retained with mountains removed. Second, weather forecast simulations which have already been carried out by weather prediction centers around the world will be analyzed. The project team will examine forecasts that compared well with what occurred, such as those in which the weather disturbances moved eastward across the Maritime Continent.<br/>The project will improve understanding of the MJO. On a more practical level, the project will lead to improved long-range weather forecasts. A graduate student will also be trained. The results of this project will be communicated to the public through public lectures, blogs, and op-ed pieces."

Previous attempts to determine how many species there are and how they are related have failed because of the large number of potential species involved, extensive hybridization among these species, and the seemingly recent evolutionary divergence of species within the group. The limited understanding of goldenrod biodiversity has slowed progress in plant evolutionary ecology.  Goldenrods have emerged as a critical study system for many important processes including species formation, invasive species biology, nutrient cycling in soils, and pollination biology. This research will reconstruct evolutionary relationships in the group by using large amounts of DNA sequence data. Project participants, including three undergraduate researchers, will sample tissue from specimens representing all 150 putative goldenrod species under the guidance of a project collaborator who is the global expert on goldenrod taxonomy. This approach will allow the genealogy of this large genus to be reconstructed rapidly and economically, and will provide an essential evolutionary framework for other goldenrod researchers.<br/><br/>This project will employ an anchored phylogenomics approach to capture DNA sequence data from 1200 locations across the genome of goldenrods (Solidago, Asteraceae). Multiple samples from each species will be obtained exclusively from herbarium specimens, which have been shown to harbor DNA of sufficient quantity and quality for this genomic technique. Sampling will focus on the >4200 Solidago herbarium specimens for which the research team and collaborators have previously obtained a chromosome count, with the cytotype of additional samples estimated using a highly-accurate microsatellite allele number approach. Both diploids-only and combined diploid/polyploid species trees will be reconstructed in order to establish both divergent and reticulate evolutionary events. Phylogenetic, taxonomic, and methodological results stemming from this research will be disseminated in scientific journals and more broadly through a Solidago-focused website maintained by a project collaborator."

The impact of this uptake in the marine environment is lessened by the dissolution of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to calcium and carbonate ions, allowing carbonate ions to bind free hydrogen ions that cause the decrease in pH.  Researchers from the University of Southern California and California Institute of Technology have developed a new method for determining carbonate dissolution rates that work in both laboratory and field settings.  Preliminary data using this technique has revealed a distinct difference in measured rates between those obtained in the laboratory and those in the field.  It is crucial that laboratory and field measurements be standardized to be able to accurately study and compare dissolution rate studies. As such, the researchers will perform extensive fieldwork and laboratory to bridge the gap between these dissolution rate measurements.  Results will be widely useful to the ocean chemistry community, especially modelers, wishing to study any aspect of ocean carbonate chemistry, as well as paleoceanographers using carbonate material to study past ocean conditions.  Graduate students will be co-mentored by the researchers, and the University of Southern California?s (USC) Young Researcher Program will allow the researchers to involve local high school students. USC International Relations students will be involved in the project, not only gaining scientific experience, but also will learn the policy aspect of the science.<br/><br/>Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolution helps to mitigate the effects of ocean acidification (OA) and is a key factor in the ocean?s alkalinity balance. The researchers have recently developed a novel tracer methodology which can monitor carbonate dissolution rates in both the lab and field. This method traces the transfer of 13C from labeled solids to seawater. Using this method has led to breakthroughs in understanding the controls of CaCO3 dissolution kinetics, but it has also revealed that the measurements made in a lab and in the field are not entirely in line. It is crucial to be able to correlate these two measurements to be able to fully study and understand the dynamics of CaCO3 dissolution. Therefore, the researchers will extend their previous work to standardize the results of measurements in the lab with those in the ocean. The North Pacific Ocean with a gradient in carbonate saturation states will be used for the field study, and lab-based experiments will allow the researchers to constrain variables such as pressure, the dissolved inorganic carbon/alkalinity ratio, and concentrations of phosphate. This research will further understanding of OA, the mechanisms controlling carbonate dissolution, and how the ocean modulates its alkalinity budget."

At the beginning of the 1800s, prairie covered a great swath of North America. Since then, about 99% of the tallgrass prairie has been destroyed. The small, isolated patches of prairie that remain harbor great biodiversity, yet rates of local plant extinctions are alarmingly high in remnant prairies. This project will advance scientific understanding of why some populations go extinct and others persist. Threats to prairie populations include fire suppression, declines of pollinators, inbreeding, loss of genetic diversity, and a reduced capacity to evolve by natural selection. This project builds on a long-term investigation of these ecological and genetic processes and feedbacks between them affecting a model prairie plant species. The purple coneflower typifies prairie plants in its long lifespan, often decades, and in other attributes. This study is the first of its kind to illustrate a population's capacity to adapt. In addition to advancing scientific knowledge and disseminating information to scientists and land stewards, this project will provide research experience and training to diverse participants at a level appropriate for their interests and career stage: high school, college, and graduate students, teachers, and citizen scientists in Minnesota and at the Chicago Botanic Garden.<br/><br/>The project uses formal quantitative genetic approaches and common garden experimental designs to quantify additive genetic variance for fitness, population differentiation, and inbreeding depression. Researchers will estimate the amount of genetic variation in Darwinian fitness of individuals planted in 2003, many of which flowered for the first time in 2015 using aster statistical models to analyze fitness data. Other experiments will estimate the reduction in mean fitness due to mating between siblings. Together with demographic censuses of remnant populations, started in 1996, these studies will yield comprehensive assessments of population growth rates and the potential for evolutionary rescue. A key strength of the research is that experiments are conducted in a realistic habitat, including interactions of the coneflower with its pollinators and herbivores. The core datasets comprise continuous individual fitness records, including annual survival and reproduction of over 17,000 plants in ten experiments and in 27 natural prairie remnants in Minnesota. These datasets, which will extend up to 30 years by the end of the project, offer a rare window into the interplay of evolutionary and ecological processes of a long-lived species."

To address these sustainability and seismic resiliency needs, the objective of this research is to enable an all-timber material system in a way that will include architectural as well as structural considerations. Utilization of mass timber is societally important in providing buildings that store, instead of generate, carbon and increase the economic opportunity for depressed timber-producing regions of the country. This research will focus on buildings with core walls because those building types are some of the most common for contemporary urban mid- to high-rise construction. The open floor layout will allow for commercial and mixed-use occupancies, but also will contain significant technical knowledge gaps hindering their implementation with mass timber. The research plan has been formulated to fill these gaps by: (1) developing suitable mid- to high-rise archetypes with input from multiple stakeholders, (2) conducting parametric system-level seismic performance investigations, (3) developing new critical components, (4) validating the performance with large-scale experimentation, and (5) bridging the industry information gaps by incorporating teaching modules within an existing educational and outreach framework. Situated in the heart of a timber-producing region, the multi-disciplinary team will utilize the local design professional community with timber experience and Portland State University's recently implemented Green Building Scholars program to deliver technical outcomes that directly impact the surrounding environment.<br/><br/>Research outcomes will advance knowledge at the system performance level as well as at the critical component level. The investigated building system will incorporate cross laminated timber cores, floors, and glulam structural members. Using mass timber will present challenges in effectively achieving the goal of desirable seismic performance, especially seismic resiliency. These challenges will be addressed at the system level by a unique combination of core rocking combined with beam and floor interaction to achieve non-linear elastic behavior. This system behavior will eliminate the need for post-tensioning to achieve re-centering, but will introduce new parameters that can directly influence the lateral behavior. This research will study the effects of these parameters on the overall building behavior and will develop a methodology in which designers could use these parameters to strategically control the building seismic response. These key parameters will be investigated using parametric numerical analyses as well as large-scale, sub-system experimentation. One of the critical components of the system will be the hold-down, a device that connects the timber core to the foundation and provides hysteretic energy dissipation. Strength requirements and deformation demands in mid- to high-rise buildings, along with integration with mass timber, will necessitate the advancement of knowledge in developing this low-damage component. The investigated hold-down will have large deformation capability with readily replaceable parts. Moreover, the hold-down will have the potential to reduce strength of the component in a controlled and repeatable way at large deformations, while maintaining original strength at low deformations. This component characteristic can reduce the overall system overstrength, which in turn will have beneficial economic implications. Reducing the carbon footprint of new construction, linking rural and urban economies, and increasing the longevity of buildings in seismic zones are all goals that this mass timber research will advance and will be critical to the sustainable development of cities moving forward."

However, these organizations often have limited reach because curriculum distribution is a secondary priority. The curricula and resources they produce are ""siloed"" on individual websites and may not reach a broad audience. The Planetary Laboratory is a cost effective way for organizations to produce and distribute content that is aligned with national education standards for formal instruction and amenable to out of school learning. This will help organizations satisfy their 'broader impacts' goals, improve their ability to secure funding, and expose more students to STEM education materials that may be more effective than traditional text book based lessons.<br/><br/>The Planetary Laboratory will operate an online learning management system (LMS) that curates and hosts educational content from multiple organizations. The LMS will present this content in a way that aligns with national education standards and makes it easy for teachers and students (K12 in particular) to use. Each learning challenge (a set of multimedia materials that will guide the student through content on a specific topic) will connect users with a network of organizations that produce relevant curriculum. By linking related curricula and projects across organizations, this team will build larger networks of students/teachers and learning materials, which improves the reach of each individual organization. Content can be organized to cover different types of standards (e.g., Next Generation Science Standards, Common Core) across topic areas and grades.  The Planetary Laboratory will use organizations' content to create better STEM education programs for students. It will connect STEM learning with other educational goals, particularly literacy and social and emotional learning. The barriers that schools put between different types of learning (e.g., math class teaches math; reading class teaches literacy) do not exist in the real world. The Planetary Laboratory will help teachers break down these barriers and give students a better sense of how improving their literacy, or knowing how to manage their peer relationships, is relevant to scientific enquiry and STEM careers. It will also help teach more science at earlier ages - science education is often not emphasized until middle school even though it is relevant and teachable far sooner."

These systems will have to compute over exponentially growing user focused data from ubiquitous network and internet of things (e.g., sensors, self-driving cars, mobile devices, social media). At the same time, the forward progress of scientific innovations will greatly depend on the fast and efficient computation on high volume datasets generated from scientific experiments (analyzing gravitational waves, colliding particles in the particle accelerators, etc.). However, the current computing systems are bottlenecked by memory, but high capacity, scalable memory is essential for fast and efficient data processing in the future. Unfortunately, DRAM, the predominant underlying technology for memory is facing major scaling challenge. As DRAM scales down to smaller technology nodes, cells become more vulnerable, resulting in DRAM failures. Enabling a higher capacity memory system without sacrificing reliability is a major research challenge.<br/><br/>This research focuses on developing fundamental breakthrough that can enable scalable memory system for the future systems. This proposal provides research plan and ideas to solve the DRAM scaling challenge in a completely new approach by separating the responsibility of providing reliable DRAM operation from designing memory cells with smaller feature size. The central vision of this proposal is to develop system-level detection and mitigation techniques for DRAM failures such that cells can be manufactured to be smaller without providing any reliability guarantee.  It is expected that ideas developed in this research will bridge the gap between circuits and systems and will enable a holistic approach to solve the DRAM scaling challenge. The cross-cutting nature of the work will influence circuit-level testing, computer architecture, and OS and systems design and can potentially enable collaboration between different communities (testing and systems/architecture). The ideas developed in this research will not only impact innovation in computing, but will also help numerous scientific fields to take a leap towards new innovations. The results of this research will be integrated to existing and new courses to impact student training and education, designed focusing on attracting the minority groups towards hardware and systems design to enhance diversity in the field."

The concept of employing a buffer layer inserted between a substrate and a film has been established as the most engaging approach from both technological and scientific standpoints. However, it relies upon the availability of single-crystal semiconductor substrates with physical properties not vastly different from those of films to be grown. This project aims at demonstrating a new perception of growing a single-crystal semiconductor film on a non-single-crystal arbitrary substrate using a single-crystal epitaxial template. The key lies in the single-crystal epitaxial template on which crystallographic registry is provided for the subsequent growth of a semiconductor film regardless of the properties of the underlying non-single-crystal arbitrary substrate. Two critical issues to be addressed are the formation of engineered-nanometer-surface structures that promote the formation of a single-crystal epitaxial template and the subsequent growth of a semiconductor film on the template, which provides an opportunity to acquire new knowledge in kinetics and thermodynamics governing the formation of a single-crystal epitaxial template on engineered nanometer surface structures and growth mechanisms of group III-V compound semiconductor films on the template."

Migratory birds present particularly interesting case studies in this context: they are capable of crossing huge geographic areas in search of newly suitable habitats, but their potential for adaptation to new areas may be limited by genetic cues determining the direction and timing of migration. Recent efforts to forecast species' ranges under an assortment of climate change scenarios suggest that most bird species in North America will need to shift their ranges in order to persist in the climatic conditions they experienced during the past century. Understanding the dynamics of range shifts and their long-term impacts on species' evolutionary potential is thus an important task for biologists in the 21st century. <br/><br/>This project is focused on uncovering the temporal and spatial dynamics of shifts in demography and range in the Bee hummingbirds, a young radiation including all migratory hummingbirds breeding in temperate North America. Hummingbirds are good subjects for studies of range and demography because their extreme physiologic constraints, nectivorous diet, and high dispersal abilities suggest that they are sensitive to shifts in regional climate and phenology. In addition, two of the project's focal species - Selasphorus rufus and Calypte anna - have experienced dramatic range shifts over the last 100 years, offering a chance to study the process of colonization and expansion in contemporary time. This project applies population-genomic analyses of reduced-representation DNA sequencing libraries to examine response to environmental change by (1) determining the role of founder effects and gene flow in establishing populations in novel ranges over the last century, (2) testing for genetic divergence and reduced gene flow across migratory divides, and (3) comparing demographic responses to Pleistocene climate change in a multispecies comparative framework along a latitudinal gradient."

If climate is the predominant force structuring communities, climate warming should predictably result in the loss of cold-adapted species at the expense of warm-adapted species in local communities. Alternatively, if regional climate doesn't strongly structure local communities, then species composition may not change much with climate change. However, an apparent lack of change in the species composition of local communities experiencing climate warming can also arise from a limited ability of species to shift their geographic ranges, e.g., slow rate of dispersal. Unfortunately, these two possibilities have very different implications; the first suggests communities may be somewhat resilient to climate change, while the latter implies community sensitivity, especially as climate change accelerates. This research will test the importance of community resilience vs. sensitivity to recent and future climate change, by examining unique historic data sets of plant species composition collected across regional climatic gradients in two Pacific Northwest National Parks.    The project will contribute to our understanding of the consequences of climate change and communicate this information to National Park Service and other resource managers in the Pacific Northwest.  This project will also provide opportunities for student research and training that will strengthen the scientific workforce.<br/><br/>This project will make progress on the problem of predicting change in plant communities with climate change given apparent stasis, despite the inherent challenges of differentiating drivers with similar expected outcomes. Specifically, this project will determine how strongly climate influences plant communities in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest.  Hypotheses on relations of community composition and bioclimatic variables will be tested using resurvey data sets of plant community composition originally collected over 30 years ago in two National Parks (North Cascades National Park and Mount Rainier National Park).  This historic data will be combined with newly developed joint species distribution models and high resolution data on the landscape features that influence microclimate.  Research objectives are to: I. Assess the importance of macro and microclimatic variables for community composition; II. Examine community shifts over the last four decades to determine whether compositional turnover with recent climate change is consistent with climatic buffering (resilience) vs. lagged species responses (sensitivity); and III. Conduct a multi-species seed addition experiment across large-scale and fine-scale climatic gradients to parse out the roles of recruitment limitation and demographic inertia (factors that contributed to time-lagged sensitivity) and macro- or microclimatic buffering (factors that promote resilience to climate change) in the early stages of community assembly."

Many high altitude animals survive through winter underneath snow that buffers them from extremes of temperature. Many unique and ecologically important animals live in mountainous environments, making it vital to understand and predict impacts of annual differences in snow cover on their population abundances, but as yet we have limited understanding of how snow impacts survival and reproduction of insects and other animals. This project proposes to study physiological and genetic responses to variation in snow cover in a high altitude beetle in the laboratory and the natural environment to understand how snow alters reproductive success during the winter and subsequent summer.  This work will develop a partnership between UC-Berkeley and two Primarily Undergraduate Institutions. Undergraduates at the Primarily Undergraduate Institutions will work with researchers from Berkeley, and Berkeley PhD students will supervise undergraduates from a wide variety of backgrounds and experiences. Thus both groups of students will be exposed to the culture of different educational institutions and will have access to professional contacts outside their usual network. A curriculum module developed from the project for K-12 students will be used to contribute towards their understanding of challenges that organisms face in snowy climates, and this module will be distributed to K-12 teachers through a UC Berkeley-based website.<br/><br/>For high altitude animals, summer is a time of energy gain, while energy conservation is key during winter because resources are scarce and animals rely on energy stores. To resist winter cold, high altitude insects use energy stores to synthesize metabolically expensive cryoprotectants. This may generate a trade-off between cold hardiness and energy conservation. Snow buffers thermal fluctuations, decreasing cold mortality and need for cold hardiness.  However, since temperatures are greater beneath snow than in a snow-free, exposed habitat, there may be increased overall energy demand associated with living under snow.  Due to the energetic trade-off, inter-annual fluctuations in winter snowpack and air temperature will alter selective pressures on overwintering organisms, and may significantly affect growth and reproduction in summer. The central hypothesis is that variation in snow cover alters selective pressures on cold hardiness and energy conservation, influencing physiological performance of overwintering individuals and genetic composition of survivors. The investigators further hypothesize that cold hardiness trades off against future reproduction by depleting winter energy reserves due to energetic costs of cold hardiness. The research will: 1) Measure how variation in snow alters selective gradients on winter-relevant genetic variation in a high altitude beetle, and isolate causal drivers of winter selective gradients. 2) Gain a predictive and quantitative understanding of how cold and energy stressors interact to shape physiological performance during winter and the subsequent summer. 3) Uncover mechanisms underlying interactions between cold and energy stress by asking how single or combined stressors alter reaction norms for energy reserves and cryoprotectants."

MBC living stock collections help advance scientific understanding in numerous fields in biology. The facility provides the most diverse and thoroughly documented collections of palms and cycads in the US, through its historic and ongoing plant exploration fieldwork, as well as its location in frost-free, subtropical South Florida. In addition, to their use in research and education, maintaining these collections reduces the need for field collecting, preventing the extirpation of species from their natural habitats. However, South Florida is prone to more frequent lightning and hurricane strikes and these hazards threaten the security of the collection. Loss of electrical power in Florida is highly correlated with lightning and wind, and such interruptions create dangerous conditions for tender seedlings in the greenhouse, and living stocks in cold storage. Thus, backup power for these facilities will ensure continued and increased service of this collection to researchers and to the public. MBC closely collaborates with local institutions, including some of the most diverse university communities in the US.  MBC also fully leverages its living collection for education, training, broadened participation, and public understanding of science. This is accomplished through programs in service learning, paid fellowships, frequent student fieldtrips, high school internships, volunteer programs, guided tours, and frequent online and printed publications. <br/><br/><br/>This project will ensure continued security of the living collections for further research use. Recent improvements to MBC's living collections propagation and cryostorage environment have improved survivability, leading to greater diversity of the collection. This project will install an automatic backup generator system to ensure uninterrupted electrical power to the propagation and cyrostorage facilities. This will ensure that critical environmental systems (reverse osmosis water filtration, timed mist and irrigation, air circulation, environmental controls, and ultracold freezer systems) can function in the event of a short- to long-term power outage. This upgrade will ensure the long-term security of these living collections, and their future service to the NSF BIO-funded research community. Ensuring a stable environment for cryostorage and propagation facilities will also further increase the potential diversity of the living collections, helping to reach a broader pool of potential users.

The most useful approximations should give not only accurate estimates, but also (1) come with tight and conservative error bounds and (2) can be improved continuously to trade time for increased accuracy in a memory efficient and predictable way (an ""anytime"" property). Such algorithms should allow us to solve easy problems with strong certificates of accuracy, and also identify harder problems together with clear guidance for further improvement. Unfortunately, most state-of-the-art methods, including deterministic variational methods and Monte Carlo-based methods, often do not fully satisfy these criteria.  <br/><br/>This project aims to develop a new generation of inference tools with tight non-asymptotic confidence bounds and anytime property. Based on several key insights that connect variational inference with non-asymptotic bounds of Monte Carlo, the PI derives a spectrum of powerful methods that naturally integrate and combine the advantages of these two approaches, providing a new foundation for more reliable inference. The project also develops novel non-asymptotic error bounds for advanced Monte Carlo methods such as annealed importance sampling (AIS), based on which the researchers construct highly efficient estimates and bounds built on the state-of-the-art AIS. The approaches are tested extensively on various application domains, and provide practical guidance and open source packages for practitioners. The new powerful anytime, error-aware inference tools will lead much more reliable use of graphical models across different application domains, greatly expanding our ability of reasoning over large datasets and complex phenomena."

Depletion of the ozone layer occurs through a series of chemical reactions in which ozone molecules are destroyed by reacting with halogens (chlorine, bromine, etc.) with some of the halogens originating from man-made halocarbons. These reactions are enhanced with cold temperatures at stratospheric altitudes. Current computer models are capable estimating the magnitude of ozone hole development in the stratosphere over the polar regions, but the models underestimate the amount of stratospheric cooling as compared to measurements made by ground-based remote-sensing LIDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) instruments. This project seeks to better understand the role of atmospheric gravity waves in the Earth's stratosphere and their potential effects on the Antarctic ozone layer. Accurate forecasts of the Antarctic ozone hole parameters by coupling atmospheric chemistry and climate models are critical for monitoring ozone hole recovery. This, in turn, is important for understanding whether or not the goals of the Montreal protocol are being met.<br/><br/>The high-resolution Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model will be used to account for effects of atmospheric gravity waves that propagate upward in the lower atmosphere and, therefore, affect atmospheric circulation, stratospheric temperature, and consequently behavior of the Antarctic ozone layer. A number of Antarctic ground-based lidar data (from McMurdo, South Pole, Davis, Syowa stations, and past observations at Rothera Station) will be used to validate and examine the WRF modeling results. The enhanced gravity wave parameterization will be used to run ""The Whole Atmosphere Community Climate Model"" (WACCM) to study the stratospheric circulation and temperatures above Antarctica. This research effort is a cost-effective investment that will advance the state of knowledge of lower atmosphere dynamics and improve or correct parameterization of gravity waves and, thereby, improve models of the lower atmosphere. In turn this will improve understanding of how lower atmosphere processes can affect ozone depletion reactions.

First, the effects of unscheduled interruptions to critical systems ripple outward to other business areas. Second, critical systems are often incompatible with constantly changing mainstream tools such as host-based antivirus and intrusion-detection systems. Third, critical systems often lag behind other systems patch levels because they are rarely taken out of service for patching.

The new sensing principle will enable non-contact measurement of position without requiring the placement of any sensors or sensing components on the ferrous object. Moving ferromagnetic objects such as cars, pistons, spool valves and a large variety of moving components in various machines have magnetic fields which vary as a function of the position around the object.  The spatial variation of an object's magnetic field as a function of position, the measurement of magnetic field at a few discrete spatially separated locations and the use of novel estimation algorithms yield accurate estimation of the position of the monitored objects, with no pre-calibration required. This technology would have extensive applications in automotive, industrial and off-road vehicle domains.<br/><br/>In order to exploit the ""inherent"" magnetic fields of common ferromagnetic objects, a number of technical challenges need to be addressed.  These include unknown magnetic field parameters, the need to design nonlinear observers and the need for estimation techniques that can account for constraints on states and parameters.  These challenges are addressed by using dual sensors with a known separation distance between them and by formulating rigorous observer design methods for nonlinear systems.  The use of redundant sensors enables observability and enables estimation of both parameters and states without requiring pre-calibration. The design of nonlinear observers provides global guarantees of stability, is computationally efficient, elegant, and yields faster convergence.  Constraints on states or parameters, and transient errors due to unexpected magnetic disturbances, are addressed using a moving horizon estimation method in which known bounds are imposed using a constrained optimization formulation.  Major project tasks include analytical study of nonlinear observer design methods, development of disturbance rejection techniques, and implementation of constraint imposition techniques.

This project will examine the deep structure of the passive margin and provide a better understanding of the early tectonic evolution, heat flow, and sediment accumulation along the east coast of the United States. Understanding the geologic history will improve our knowledge of natural resources and ancient submarine landslides that affected the continental slope. The project supports the training of a graduate student.<br/><br/>Specifically, the researcher and graduate student will investigate the deep structure and origin of the Blake Spur Magnetic Anomaly, which lies offshore the eastern United States. Seismic data collected during the Eastern North American Margin community experiment will be used to image the crust and upper mantle beneath this magnetic anomaly. A preliminary inspection of the seismic data suggests that seismic waves here can travel through the mantle with a speed that is higher parallel to the magnetic anomaly than perpendicular to it. This form of seismic anisotropy can be used to test whether mantle melt infiltration or stretching of the mantle rock created the rock fabric of the rifted margin."

If harnessed, non-fusion production of seeds will change the way hybrid seeds, such as corn, are currently made in agriculture. In order to understand the mechanisms of non-fusion reproduction, we propose to first understand how non-fusion embryos are formed in a simpler group of plants - ferns. Ferns are non-seed plants that lack the storage part of a seed but nonetheless form an embryo as the result of a sperm fertilizing an egg (fusion). The salient feature of a fern is having the sperm and egg producing parts of the plant housed in a tiny, free-living entity independent of the mother plants. Therefore this tiny, simple, green entity provides a rare opportunity to study the mechanisms of fusion reproduction, and important to this project, the non-fusion formation of an embryo without fertilization. Using this system, the genes key to non-fusion reproduction will be identified and their functions in this process tested. This research program will emphasize the identification and training of talented female scientists and data from the proposed research will be used in an undergraduate course.<br/><br/>Normally performing the essential roles of gamete formation and fertilization, the macroscopic gametophytes can also be coaxed to produce sporophytes without fertilization, a process called apogamy. In the reverse process, apospory, sporophytes can be made to produce gametophytes without meiosis. With apogamy and apospory, ferns can exhibit non-fusion alternation of the sporophyte and the gametophyte generations. This level of plasticity alternating between the two generations is not seen in seed plants. Thus, the apogamy and apospory of ferns offer an ideal system to answer the question that lies at the heart of non-fusion reproduction: Which genes control the developmental pathways leading to the gametophyte or the sporophyte generations? It is hypothesized that many genes that control fusion reproduction in ferns and seed plants are conserved and non-fusion reproduction in land plants has arisen by altering these genes. Furthermore, the non-fusion alternation of generations through apogamy and apospory in the model fern C. richardii occurs by altered regulation of a set of genes that normally are reserved for initiating embryogenesis from a zygote and gametogenesis from a spore, respectively. The research team has built up necessary technology and materials including apogamy induction, stable gene transfer, C. richardii transcriptome, and whole mount in situ methods. These will be used to achieve the goal of identifying key genes and gene networks involved in apogamy and apospory in the model fern C. richardii with the following specific aims: Studying the role of the candidate genes in fusion/non-fusion alternation of generations in C. richardii, gene discovery for apogamy and apospory in C. richardii, and functional analysis of newly discovered genes that are predicted to act in non-fusion alternation of generations in C. richardii."

This Noyce Track 4B research project seeks to address one of the areas identified as it studies the extent to which those institutions receiving Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship (Noyce) funding from the National Science Foundation have prepared more knowledgeable beginning teachers than those institutions which have not received Noyce grants during Noyce funding cycles as measured by outcomes on Praxis II subject matter knowledge exams given to first time test takers. Through a collaborative research effort between Stony Brook University and Kennesaw State University, and working with the Educational Testing Service (ETS), the project will undertake the disaggregation of Praxis II test scores over the past fifteen years to determine to what extent those institutions receiving Noyce funding have prepared more knowledgeable beginning teachers than those without Noyce awards.  <br/><br/>The list of Noyce awardees from the NSF website will be used to categorize Praxis II test takers coming from Noyce and non-Noyce institutions over the past fifteen years. Using the self-reported demographic data from Praxis II test takers, the institutional codes will be compared to the Noyce and non-Noyce institution list and a simple count of students at each institution will be performed. As not all states have used Praxis II exams for licensure, only a subset of the Noyce portfolio will be captured in the analysis. The measure of teacher knowledge will be analyzed at two levels related to outcomes on the Praxis II subject matter knowledge exams. Level 1: analysis will use individual state cut scores for the respective year exams. This will provide a look at whether institutions are preparing STEM teacher candidates for a level pre-determined by their respective states. Level 2: analysis of Praxis II subject matter knowledge for a raw percent correct score on the exam.  An average exam score will be calculated for each exam and teacher candidates will be placed into groups based on their performance relative to the mean (i.e., 1 standard deviation above the mean, 1 standard deviation below the mean, etc.). The outcome variables described in Level 1 and Level 2 will be analyzed as well as additional differences in performance by demographic variables for the total population and also by Noyce and non-Noyce institutions. Example questions that will be answered include: Do Noyce institutions prepare more minority STEM teacher candidates compared to non-Noyce institutions? Do women at Noyce institutions outperform women at non-Noyce institutions based on STEM Praxis II content knowledge exams? Do Noyce institutions have a higher number of non-traditional first-time Praxis II test takers compared to their non-Noyce peers? In order to develop a model for impact of Noyce on different institutions, average incoming SAT scores will be used as a covariate in the regression analysis that will control for selectivity of the institution. In the descriptive analysis, only schools with similar entrance requirements and average SAT/ACT scores to each other will be used. In order to measure the impact of the Noyce funding related to the quality of the scholars in situations where a university has had both Noyce scholars and non-Noyce scholars, data on the number of test takers in each Praxis II STEM field, their average GPA, and whether or not they have in-field majors prior to Noyce funding will be used to establish a baseline for number and type of teacher education graduates. This will allow for analysis of subsequent data to determine whether these patterns changed after receiving Noyce funding. An empirical study will be conducted limited to a subsample of the NOYCE schools to examine the effect of the proportion of Noyce graduates to total STEM education graduates in the given year. It will be included as a coefficient in the regression models to adjust the comparison of averages between the Noyce institutions based on the size of the proportion. If there is evidence that the ratio is related to the average PRAXIS scores at the institution level, then it will be collected on additional schools and incorporated into the comparison of averages between Noyce and non-Noyce institutions.  Ultimately, this study will examine the influence of the Noyce program on the depth of content knowledge for beginning STEM teachers as they enter the profession."

A fundamental means by which plant species cope with this challenge is through monitoring day length, the environmental signal that most reliably predicts calendar date. Based on that information, individuals then either continue vegetative growth or initiate flowering. The most favorable time of year for flowering differs by location. For instance, winter arrives earlier at higher latitudes and elevations. Therefore, understanding how and why photoperiodic flowering responses have been adjusted to permit species to thrive across broad geographic ranges is important knowledge that can inform efforts to preserve biodiversity and successfully manage crops in the face of a changing environment. The proposed work will address this goal by studying how populations of the common monkeyflower, Mimulus guttatus, vary along elevation gradients in the critical day length necessary to induce flowering. The molecular changes and ecological impacts of this variation will be investigated with complementary studies in the lab and field. These combined datasets will then permit development of predictive models to test whether populations will be resilient to future climates. The investigators - working with undergraduates at three University of California institutions, the USA National Phenology Network, and volunteers - will also develop a new citizen science initiative to monitor the flowering of important wildflower species in remote alpine locations along the Pacific Crest Trail.<br/><br/>Although much is known about the molecular mechanisms by which photoperiod regulates flowering in controlled conditions, far less is understood about how these pathways function in natural seasonal conditions or what adjustments to these pathways may prove beneficial in future climates. Preliminary work in M. guttatus has shown that replicate altitudinal shifts in critical photoperiod evolved through changes at distinct sets of loci. The proposed research will characterize the genetic basis and physiological consequences of these diverse mechanisms by utilizing the extensive genomic toolkit available in this emerging model plant system. Specifically, the molecular basis of range-wide variation in critical photoperiod will be established. Through transcriptional analyses under controlled conditions and through field trials, the investigators will also test whether the distinct sets of loci that achieve similar shifts in critical photoperiod do so via equivalent modifications of downstream expression within the flowering gene regulatory network or have unique effects that are adaptive within each local environment. The former finding would suggest a broad capacity for physiological systems to adjust to novel conditions, and the latter would suggest genetic variation may prove a significant constraint on the pace of adaptation. Finally, through investigating forms of diversity abundant in annual M. guttatus but not well explored in other model plants, the proposed research will extend ecophysiological models of flowering time and foster more accurate forecasts of the impact of environmental variation on plant growth and population distribution."

This project will also support the education and training of two graduate students. providing them the opportunity to develop a physical understanding of the atmospheric circulation and practical experience with high performance scientific computing.<br/><br/>This project will connect theory, modeling, and observations of stratospheric transport. The Brewer-Dobson Circulation describes the transport of mass and trace gases through the stratosphere. In concert with chemical processes, it sets the distribution of water vapor and ozone through the middle atmosphere. Models nearly unanimously predict the Brewer-Dobson Circulation to increase in response to anthropogenic forcing, but the circulation cannot be observed directly, due to the slow time scale of overturning (on the order of years). In situ and satellite-based estimates of the ""age of air,"" a measure of the transport time from the surface to stratosphere which can be estimated from observations of trace gases, however, do not robustly detect a change in transport. Some even suggest a weakening of the circulation, although large uncertainties imply that model trends are not inconsistent. <br/><br/>The first goal of this project is to establish a connection between the stratospheric circulation and age distributions with three-dimensional atmospheric models. In particular, the latitudinal structure of age, which can be calculated directly from measurements of trace gases such as CO2 or SF6,  will be related to the mean circulation of mass, which is diagnosed in climate model integrations. The second goal is to use these insights to evaluate stratospheric transport in numerical models, connecting standard tests of dynamical cores to the climatological properties of the circulation. Theoretical constraints on age transport will be used to detect biases in climate models arising from deficiencies in their representation of the circulation and/or tracer transport. The third and final goal is to evaluate the new tracer-transport diagnostics in the context of climate change."

The most recent and best-exposed flood basalt event erupted about 16 million years ago from eastern Oregon. This is the target of our study. The fundamental driving mechanism for flood basalt eruptions occurs below the lithospheric plate, and the event has a major effect on modifying the plate. Yet, we do not understand the fundamentals of these events. It our case, there is strong evidence that large pieces of the affected lithosphere foundered and sank into the asthenosphere, and that the distribution of the foundering lithosphere controlled the location and distribution of volcanism. Our study will use seismic imaging methods to image the structures created and modified by this event, both in the crust and in the underlying lithosphere and asthenosphere, with the specific goals of finding the primary magma chamber(s) and resolving their shape.<br/><br/>We will deploy about 60 seismometers in a line extending north 150 km from the center of the main eruptive center in northeast Oregon into southwest Washington, out of the eruptive area.

The two primary techniques to be employed involve (1) the conversion of P waves to S waves that occurs when the wave hits an interface (such as the boundaries of the now-frozen magma chamber(s) we are studying), and (2) the time advance (or delay) that occurs for each ray as it passes through the region of interest. These delays are used to make a tomographic image of the major volumes of Earth that have been created by the flood basalt event."

It is a truism that  computers have grown steadily more powerful over the years, but equally important (if not more so) than the amount of sheer computing power available is how efficiently we are able to harness that power.  Finding an efficient strategy to solve a given problem (in the language of computer science, an efficient algorithm) can often spell the difference between success and failure.  (As an illustrative analogy, consider the task of assembling a large jigsaw puzzle.  A poor choice of strategy such as a brute-force approach of trying each pair of pieces against each other may be infeasibly slow, while a cleverer approach such as grouping pieces by their color can be radically more efficient and lead to a feasible solution.)  But in order to fully understand the abilities of efficient  algorithms, it is crucial to also understand their limits: what is it that efficient algorithms *cannot* do? The field of ""computational  complexity"", which is the subject of the PIs' project, seeks to mathematically prove that certain computational problems do not admit *any* efficient algorithm no matter how long and hard we try to develop one.  Such results can have both practical value (by guiding algorithm development away from ""dead ends"") and deep theoretical significance, as they play a profound role in shaping our fundamental understanding of the phenomenon of computation.<br/><br/>The 1980s witnessed exciting progress on a range of Boolean circuit models (a mathematical abstraction of the digital circuits that modern computers are built from) in computational complexity; researchers succeeded in proving many lower bounds establishing that various computational problems have no efficient algorithms in these models.  However, further progress slowed significantly after the 1980s. Many of the landmark results obtained in this era were based on the ""method of random restrictions"", which roughly speaking uses probabilistic arguments to show that Boolean circuits can be dramatically simplified by making certain random substitutions of constant values for input variables.  In this project the PIs will intensively investigate an extension of the method of random restrictions which they call the ""method of random projections."" Rather than simply substituting constant values for input variables, the random projection method additionally identifies groups of variables, ""projecting"" them all to the same new variable so that they must all take the same value.  While the underlying idea is simple, it turns out that this identification of variables helps ""maintain useful structure"" which is extremely useful for proving lower bounds.  In recent work the PIs have successfully used this new ""method of random projections"" to solve several decades-old problems in Boolean circuit lower bounds and related areas (which in some cases had notoriously resisted progress since the 1980s or 1990s).  As the main intellectual goals of the project, the PIs will continue to develop and apply the method of random projections to attack important open problems in Boolean circuit complexity.<br/><br/>In addition to the technical goals described above, other central goals of the project are to educate, communicate, and inspire.  The PIs will train graduate students through research collaboration, disseminate research results through seminar talks, survey articles and other publications, and continue ongoing outreach activities aimed at increasing interest in and awareness of theoretical computer science topics in a broader population, including presentations at elementary schools."

Many rare or endangered species have experienced sharp population declines known as population ""bottlenecks"".  These bottlenecks can have deleterious genetic impacts similar to inbreeding and affect the probability of species recovery. Understanding and quantifying these effects in populations allows for more effective management and better prediction of survival outcomes. A model example of a species that has experienced population bottlenecks is the sea otter. It was hunted almost to extinction, with numerical declines of >99% during the course of the 18th -19th century fur trade. The small number of surviving otters increased over the 20th century under careful monitoring and enhanced protection. In this project, the researchers will endeavor to determine whether the fur trade decline had lasting impacts on the sea otter genome that can be observed in extant populations. The researchers will compare genomes of sea otters that lived before the fur trade to those living today across the entire geographic range. Native American rubbish deposits, known as middens, dating back to Pre-Columbian times will supply the prehistoric and historical samples.  The researchers will use cutting-edge gene sequencing technology to identify deleterious genes and predict their effect on individuals and populations. The results will inform future management plans for these populations and provide a new precedent for research on rare and endangered species. Researchers also will work with the Monterey Bay Aquarium and Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute to create exhibits demonstrating how genome sequencing can aid conservation efforts and provide new genomic insights into a charismatic species that has an essential role in maintaining coastal kelp forest ecosystems.<br/><br/>This project will utilize low and high coverage genome sequencing of individuals from six modern and three ancient pre-bottlenecked sea otter populations to reconstruct demographic history and quantify patterns of deleterious variation as a proxy for genetic load. A novel analytical framework will be developed using genetic variation data across multiple time points to study the relationship between small population size and patterns of deleterious mutations. Using forward-in-time simulations, null expectations of how genetic drift should act on different genomic elements will be developed for comparison to the empirical genomic dataset, and the importance of natural selection in preserving and purging deleterious variation will be quantified. The roles of purifying, relaxed and balancing selection will be examined by testing for enrichment of deleterious variation across genic regions. This research will provide a framework for distinguishing between moderately and strongly deleterious mutations and for evaluating the effects of bottlenecks on natural selection at the molecular level that can be applicable to other systems. As a result of this research, a variety of recent demographic events in a species with a complex demographic history will be detected and quantified, patterns of deleterious mutations across multiple time points will be compared, and patterns of genetic load will be predicted. Finally, the ways in which purifying and balancing selection are affected by small population sizes will be evaluated. The replication of recent extreme demographic events across sea otter populations and the abundance of pre-fur trade otter samples in Pre-Columbian middens provide unprecedented opportunities to isolate the effects of a bottleneck on deleterious variation and genetic load. The results and methods developed in this study will be broadly applicable to understanding the biology of small populations, especially those that are endangered."

This research will bridge an existing gap between Earth System Models and observational studies to assess how climate change will influence ocean biogeochemistry.  Additionally, this project will support an early-career scientist and a graduate student, and the researchers are dedicated to mentoring undergraduate students through various programs at Colorado University - Boulder, National Center for Atmospheric Research, and the University of Wisconsin. <br/><br/>Earth System Model (ESM) simulations used to predict future changes in ocean biogeochemistry attributed to either natural or anthropogenic influences suffer from uncertainties, particularly on regional scales.

This research aims to quantify the uncertainty on three levels: uncertainty due to internal variability, model structure, and emission scenario. Using output from the Community Earth System Model (CESM) and models in the Fifth Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5), this study will evaluate the degree to which uncertainty has changed with newer models. Additionally, observations from global databased, satellites, and time-series sites will be used to compare models and assess the varying levels of skill in predicting the biogeochemistry of a region. The researchers also plan to break down the various components of the driving mechanisms behind prediction uncertainty, so that future models can begin to take these factors into account."

Home to Syracuse University, the University of Rochester, and Cornell University, and centrally located amongst a number of other premier research institutions, the Finger Lakes region of New York State has a long tradition of outstanding scholarship in probability theory and related fields. In the past, conferences such as the Cayuga Triangle Probability Seminar fostered collaborative relationships between researchers at these institutions, and events like the Cornell Probability Summer Schools helped establish the region as an international center of research and education in probability. The proposed seminar will build on the successes of these past endeavors and help revitalize probability in the Finger Lakes region. In addition to bringing together researchers from diverse areas of study to share insights and initiate new research projects, the seminar will have a broader impact by educating students and young researchers in preparation for careers in science, finance, and other industries.<br/><br/>Probability is one of the most widely used mathematical tools in applications of all sorts, and it is of paramount importance that the younger generations have the skills and knowledge to employ it correctly and to continue increasing our understanding of how to deal rigorously with the uncertainties faced in the natural and social sciences. The Finger Lakes Probability Seminar will expose students from a wide variety of backgrounds to the probabilistic way of thinking and to cutting edge developments in the field, and will help integrate the next generation of researchers into the broader probability community.  The conference will focus on several different sub-topics within the field of probability, including Integrable Probability, Random Matrix Theory, Large Deviations, Schramm-Loewner Evolution, Stochastic Partial Differential Equations, Spin Glasses, Percolation, and Markov chain Mixing, as well as the application of probabilistic methods to other disciplines such as biology, economics, statistics, and computer science.

Atypical Gulf Stream position, air-sea heat flux, extremes in ocean temperature, and sea level rise are potential harbingers of larger shifts in atmospheric and oceanic forcing. Effects on shelf-deep ocean exchange are unknown due to incomplete dynamical understanding of the present. Development of predictive capacity is particularly relevant at this time, as oil and gas exploration is being planned. The understanding of shelf-deep ocean exchange gained through this project will be applicable to other regions where shelf and basin-scale currents converge and could improve our capacity to anticipate the response of the coastal ocean to climate change in the coming decades. In addition to the physical interactions between scales and oceanic regions, the relevance of exported shelf waters at Cape Hatteras to global carbon budgets may be large, and is difficult to quantify due to carbon budget mediation by biological ecosystems that vary with season and water mass. Both ecosystems and export processes may change under predicted climatic shifts, so understanding export processes has broad biogeochemical importance. Collaborations with biogeochemists and ecologists will be pursued to utilize the data to study ecosystems in this area of high biological diversity that is home to many commercially important species. Insights gained through the project will also improve mitigation of pollutant spills. The outreach and educational efforts include a public exhibit and talks, opportunities for joining science cruises and participation in the Society of Women Engineers ""Girls Engineer It! Day"", a daylong event for girls in grades 6-12, and the Wood Hole Oceanographic Institution's summer program for undergraduates from underrepresented groups. The project will support two early career scientists, train one postdoctoral researcher and four graduate students, and give undergraduate students hands-on experience in the operation of the autonomous gliders.<br/><br/>Subtropical and subpolar oceanic gyre boundaries are characterized by confluent western boundary currents and convergence in the adjacent shelf and slope waters. Together, they lead to large net export of shelf waters to the deep ocean, and complex, bidirectional shelf-deep ocean exchange, in response to strong forcing typical of mid-latitude western ocean margins. Shelf-deep ocean exchange processes at such dynamic sites remain poorly understood, due in part to the technical challenge of resolving broad ranges of relevant spatial and temporal scales. The understanding gained by investigating the wide seasonal range of parameter space will facilitate exploration of how shelf circulation and shelf-open ocean exchange may evolve due to observed and projected long-term shifts in regional and basin-scale circulation, hydrography, and atmospheric forcing. This project will deploy fixed, mobile, and remote observational platforms in combination with idealized and realistic numerical simulations to investigate exchange processes near Cape Hatteras. The sampling array will provide an observational data set with unprecedented temporal and spatial resolution in a region of large episodic export and exchange. These observations will be used to identify dominant exchange processes; correlate them with observed forcing; define ranges of forcing and shelf response; verify parallel developments within the realistic model framework; and establish causation through detailed assessment of momentum and vorticity balances, integrating observational and validated model products. In addition to physical data, the autonomous gliders will also collect chlorophyll fluorescence, oxygen saturation, and acoustic backscatter data that are of direct relevance to biogeochemical properties exported from the shelf to the deep ocean. These non-physical data will be used as water mass tracers and to portray the structure of the chlorophyll-a and dissolved oxygen at unprecedented resolution."

However, the outstandingly rich, relatively little-known fossil beds of Patagonia, southern Argentina, provide an unrivaled opportunity to learn whether life responded differently to mass extinction, plate tectonics, and past climate change on the other side of the world. This project will intensively sample and analyze fossil plants and animals from Patagonia through about 20 million years, from just before the end-Cretaceous dinosaur extinction (66 million years ago), through the early recovery period and the Eocene warming interval. Through groundbreaking field discoveries and state-of-the-art lab techniques, this research aims to transform understanding of the origins of the Southern Hemispheres flora and environments, the role of Patagonia, and the legacy of surviving living fossils now located in vulnerable rainforest areas as far away as Southeast Asia. The work will generate the most complete terrestrial record and curated fossil-plant collection for the Southern Hemisphere through a critical interval of Earth history. It will produce a new, globally significant reference point for studying mass extinction, recovery, and response to climate change from a fossilized living laboratory, with direct importance for conservation and ecosystem management today. In addition to scholarly publications and meeting presentations, a large number of educational, training, and outreach activities are planned. These will include exhibits, educational resource development for public engagement with the fossil sites, and a trilingual childrens book. <br/> <br/>The project will use field paleontology and stratigraphy at a series of exceptional Patagonian fossil localities, dating from the latest Cretaceous to middle Eocene, to elevate understanding of Patagonia's uniquely informative fossil floras. Most of the fossil sites are located in the La Colonia, Lefipan, Salamanca, Penas Coloradas, and Huitrera formations of Chubut and neighboring provinces. The research will focus on five, broadly related questions targeting significant gaps in knowledge. (1) Was Patagonia a refuge from the end-Cretaceous mass extinction? (2) What are the composition, diversity, and biogeographic affinities of the earliest Paleocene floras and insect faunas? (3) Do the Eocene floras and faunas contain lineages that now survive in South America, Asia, and Africa, as well as Australasia? (4) Do the Eocene floras document the earliest phases of South American isolation by showing a loss of Gondwanan taxa and an increase in New World taxa through time? (5) How much geologic time does the prolific early Eocene site at Laguna del Hunco represent, and what processes formed these unique deposits that preserved one of the most diverse fossil biotas in the world?"

It is formed by a mixture of atmospheric neutral species and charged particles (ions and electrons) created, mostly, by the absorption of solar radiation. The dynamical behavior of geospace depends on various physical processes occurring in the Sun, in the Sun-Earth environment, and in the lower (below 50 miles) atmosphere. The research plan of this award will combine existing ground-based radar measurements made in Peru with space-based measurements.  These results together with new measurements would be utilized to assist the development of computer numerical models that would provide better specification of the low-latitude ionosphere and its dependence upon local time, solar flux levels, and geomagnetic activity. The broader impact of the funded work will provide professional training for undergraduate and graduate students in the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics. The project will also enhance the curriculum of the Physics program at UT Dallas. Finally, the project is expected to also increase public literacy about scientific and technological aspects of the Earth's geospace environment through the medium of public lectures presented at the Space Center at regular intervals.<br/><br/>The research plan to combine measurements and modeling would achieve greatly-improved understanding of fundamental physical processes responsible for the ionospheric dynamical behavior.

Failure in these rubber-like materials governs design rules in applications ranging from transportation to biomaterials. Unlike many rigid materials, cracks in rubber-like materials can blunt macroscopically as the material undergoes large deformations. This complicates the stress state at the tip of the crack, which varies depending on the material. Current understanding of the failure mechanism cannot explain the energy differences in two different loading geometries, cutting versus tearing. Potential benefits include design criteria to serve as targets to guide the fabrication of new materials. Results can be generalized to describe puncture and insertion of needles in soft tissue; these failure mechanisms play a key role in diagnostics and guided-needle therapeutics. This project will provide educational opportunities facilitated by the PI as many of the experiments in this project are accessible to undergraduate researchers. The PI will recruit female undergraduate students to participate in data-gathering throughout the project.<br/><br/>Highly deformable, crack-blunting solids exhibit fracture energies many times larger than predicted by simple cohesive models. Researchers have postulated more complex models that indicate fracture is governed by the local mechanics of the tip. These local mechanics include the material's large strain response, tip radius, and local fracture energy. To fully characterize each of these important features, the PI will supplement experimental mechanical failure data with in situ and post-mortem imaging, documenting crack tip radius, near-tip strain, and fracture mechanism. The mechanism map resulting from this experimental characterization will guide examination and, if necessary, re-interpretation of existing models describing the mechanical origin of tearing in highly deformable materials. Once established for the standard plane stress geometry, the relationship quantified in this project, between geometrically controlled (cutting) and remote-load (tearing) failure energies, will be applied to relate needle-mediated failure to standard, mode I fracture energy values."

Although the use of electronic embedded systems improves performance, driving comfort, safety, and economy for the customer; this electronic control of automotive systems makes these systems susceptible to permanent, transient, and intermittent electronic failures, which can significantly reduce the reliability and availability of these systems. In addition, recent work has demonstrated vulnerability of modern car control systems to security attacks that directly impact the automobile's physical safety and dependability. The novel aspect of this research program is the simultaneous integration of security and dependability while minimizing energy consumption and ensuring that real-time constraints of the application are not violated. The dependability and security approaches proposed in this project are also applicable to other CPS, such as transit vehicles, industrial automation, manned and unmanned air vehicles, and medical monitoring. Energy-efficient security and dependability integration, as pursued in this research program, further implies greater fuel-efficiency for combustion engine vehicles (in particular, aerial vehicles) and longer battery lifer for hybrid and electric vehicles.<br/><br/>To address the research challenge of simultaneous security and dependability integration while minimizing energy consumption, this research program proposes to leverage multicore ECUs to achieve high reliability with low energy-overhead for automotive safety-critical functions. The research program consists of two modular but inter-linked thrusts. In the first thrust, the project aims to develop a novel dependability methodology that would enable quick error detection and correction (QEDC) via an optimized combination of comparison-points and lightweight checkpointing to better meet the application's real-time constraints even in the presence of faults. The proposed dependability methodology aspires to attain energy-efficient fault tolerance by an intelligent use of dynamic voltage and frequency scaling (DVFS). The second thrust aims to develop an integrated safety and security methodology that would integrate security primitives: confidentiality, integrity, and authentication over vehicular networks in an energy-efficient manner without violating the real-time constraints imposed by the maximum tolerable response time of cyber-physical applications. The project further aims to adapt safety and security parameters (e.g., number of comparison points for QEDC, number of checkpoints, key lengths for cryptographic algorithms and message authentication codes) to meet the application's real-time requirements under changing environmental stimuli (e.g., transient fault rate and vehicular bus load)."

This project is designed to improve the ability of ecologists to predict the impact of significant tree die-off in semi-arid, forested ecosystems. The study focuses on piñon-juniper woodlands. In the Southwest U.S., where they occur, higher temperatures and decreased precipitation have increased drought severity, reducing tree health, and triggering widespread tree death across the region. This research is motivated by previous findings showing that piñon pine mortality unexpectedly leads to woodlands becoming hotter and drier, potentially altering the environmental conditions that control future plant growth and ecosystem recovery. These surprising results challenge the expectation that tree mortality would lead to increased soil water availability. This work will contribute key data on the specific roles of woody plants in regulating water availability in water-limited, semi-arid ecosystems following mortality of large numbers of trees. The modeling will clarify the extent to which specific forests are vulnerable to drought and changing climate, and will help to identify key environmental factors that increase vulnerability. One postdoctoral researcher, two graduate students, and several undergraduate researchers will receive training and support at two Hispanic-American Serving Institutions.

This project is designed to improve the ability of ecologists to predict the impact of significant tree die-off in semi-arid, forested ecosystems. The study focuses on piñon-juniper woodlands. In the Southwest U.S., where they occur, higher temperatures and decreased precipitation have increased drought severity, reducing tree health, and triggering widespread tree death across the region. This research is motivated by previous findings showing that piñon pine mortality unexpectedly leads to woodlands becoming hotter and drier, potentially altering the environmental conditions that control future plant growth and ecosystem recovery. These surprising results challenge the expectation that tree mortality would lead to increased soil water availability. This work will contribute key data on the specific roles of woody plants in regulating water availability in water-limited, semi-arid ecosystems following mortality of large numbers of trees. The modeling will clarify the extent to which specific forests are vulnerable to drought and changing climate, and will help to identify key environmental factors that increase vulnerability. One postdoctoral researcher, two graduate students, and several undergraduate researchers will receive training and support at two Hispanic-American Serving Institutions.

The basic premise is that by having more data, even if uncertain and of lower quality, we are also able to make better-informed decisions. To make any decisions, we need to perform ""inference"" over the data, i.e. to either draw new conclusions, or to find support for existing hypotheses, thus allowing us to favor one course of action over another. However, general reasoning under uncertainty is highly intractable, and many state-of-the-art systems today perform approximate inference by reverting to sampling. Thus for many modern applications (such as information extraction, knowledge aggregation, question-answering systems, computer vision, and machine intelligence), inference is a key bottleneck, and new methods for tractable approximate inference are needed.<br/><br/>This project addresses the challenge of scaling inference by generalizing two highly scalable approximate inference methods and complementing them with scalable methods for parameter learning that are ""approximation-aware."" Thus, instead of treating the (i) learning and the (ii) inference steps separately, this project uses the approximation methods developed for inference also for learning the model. The research hypothesis is that this approach increases the overall end-to-end prediction accuracy while simultaneously increasing scalability. Concretely, the project develops the theory and a set of scalable algorithms and optimization methods for at least the following four sub-problems: (1) approximating general probabilistic conjunctive queries with standard relational databases; (2) learning the probabilities in uncertain databases based on feedback on rankings of output tuples from general queries; (3) approximating the exact probabilistic inference in undirected graphical models with linearized update equations; and (4) complementing the latter with a robust framework for learning linearized potentials from partially labeled data."

Input of these nutrients, especially nitrogen, has led to eutrophication.  Eutrophication is the process wherein a body of water such as the Louisiana Shelf becomes enriched in dissolved nutrients that increase phytoplankton growth which eventually leads to decreased oxygen levels in bottom waters.  This has certainly been observed in this area, and diatoms, a phytoplankton which represents the base of the food chain, have shown variable silicon/nitrogen (Si/N) ratios.  Because diatoms create their shells from silicon, their growth is controlled not only by nitrogen inputs but the availability of silicon.  Lower Si/N ratios are showing that silicon may be playing an increasingly important role in regulating diatom production in the system.  For this reason, a scientist from the University of South Alabama will determine the biogeochemical processes controlling changes in Si/N ratios in the Louisiana Shelf system.  One graduate student on their way to a doctorate degree and three undergraduate students will be supported and trained as part of this project.  Also, four scholarships for low-income, high school students from Title 1 schools will get to participate in a month-long summer Marine Science course at the Dauphin Island Sea Laboratory and be included in the research project.   The study has significant societal benefits given this is an area where $2.4 trillion gross domestic product revenue is tied up in coastal resources.  Since diatoms are at the base of the food chain that is the biotic control on said coastal resources, the growth of diatoms in response to eutrophication is important to study.<br/><br/>Eutrophication of the Mississippi River and its tributaries has the potential to alter the biological landscape of the Louisiana Shelf system in the northern Gulf of Mexico by influencing the Si/N ratios below those that are optimal for diatom growth.  A scientist from the University of South Alabama believes the observed changes in the Si/N ratio may indicate silicon now plays an important role in regulating diatom production in the system.  As such, understanding the biotic and abiotic processes controlling the silicon cycle is crucial because diatoms dominate at the base of the food chain in this highly productive region.  The study will focus on following issues: (1) the importance of recycled silicon sources on diatom production; (2) can heavily-silicified diatoms adapt to changing Si/N ratios more effectively than lightly-silicified diatoms; and (3) the role of reverse weathering in sequestering silicon thereby reducing diffusive pore-water transport.  To attain these goals, a new analytical approach, the PDMPO method (compound 2-(4-pyridyl)-5-((4-(2-dimethylaminoethylamino-carbamoyl)methoxy)phenyl)oxazole) that quantitatively measures taxa-specific silica production would be used."

The course will be co-taught by a social scientist, a chemist, and a geoscientist and will draw on methodologies and concepts within anthropology, chemistry, and geology to equip undergraduates to conduct urgent environmental research in times of crisis.  This project will also produce a dataset for the community of Hoosick Falls, NY.  Three wide-ranging broader impacts are anticipated.  First, the students and researchers will collect independent data on PFOA concentrations in residential wells, resulting in a dataset that will help characterize the origin, extent, and trajectory of PFOA.  Second, students will assist faculty members in preparing presentations of the findings to the community, which will not only serve to inform the public, but will also help strengthen students' communication skills and help them better connect their scientific knowledge to societal outcomes.  Finally, the faculty researchers plan to develop and distribute teaching and learning materials on PFOA for inclusion in postsecondary STEM curricula. <br/><br/>Understanding the Hoosick Falls Water Crisis seeks to effect engaged student learning around the Hoosick Falls water crisis in order to provide students with robust training and experience in monitoring groundwater contamination and generate preliminary independent data that will help characterize the origin, extent, and trajectory of the PFOA groundwater plume around Hoosick Falls, NY.   The guiding educational research question is: How can environmental research on a local public crisis enhance the STEM curriculum for undergraduate students? Specifically, the researchers are studying how training students in environmental chemistry and hydrogeology and equipping them to apply those discipline-based skills to help produce key data on a local crisis will influence student enrollment and retention in STEM fields.  The researchers hypothesize that hands-on experience in meaningful environmental research will demonstrate the value of STEM fields in a liberal arts education and enhance student outcomes within STEM for both STEM and non-STEM majors. Evaluation will occur using (1) pre- and post-assessments that will measure student attitudes towards and aptitude in environmental chemistry and hydrology, (2) enrollment and course performance data, and (3) student reflections."

It is aimed at understanding the behavior of atmospheric regions from the middle atmosphere upward through the ionized upper layers of the atmosphere and into outer space in terms of coupling, energetics, chemistry, and dynamics on regional and global scales. The mid-latitude ionosphere serves as the intermediary between the active ionospheres of the polar and equatorial regions, but it has not been studied very thoroughly. This Collaborative CEDAR award involving University of Texas at Dallas, Virginia Tech University, and the University of Colorado is aimed at developing the first quiet-time empirical model of the ionosphere electric field distribution to fill in the necessary ground truth needed to produce a true understanding of the global dynamics of the ionosphere. The research effort would use 15 years of Air Force Defense Meteorological Space Plasma (DMSP) measurements of ion zonal flow speeds in the mid-latitude ionosphere to construct an empirical model of mid-latitude ionospheric quiet-time electric fields. This data set would be supplemented by ion drift data obtained from the mid-latitude SuperDARN sites. This database would be made available to outside users, and thus, would be a valuable ionospheric community resource. Following the completion of the development of the quiet time model, observations from storm times will be compared to predictions based upon application of the new quiet time model. The determined differences would be analyzed within the guidance and context of the CTIP (Coupled thermosphere ionosphere plasmasphere)-RCM model runs to understand the underlying physical mechanisms causing the observed variability relative to the baseline model established, to quantify the magnitude and extent of storm-time disturbances, and finally, to quantify the coupling of the mid-latitude ion drifts to the neutral atmosphere and the transfer of energy between the polar and equatorial regions. Finally, making use of nearly two decades of DMSP data to understand and develop empirical models goes to the heart of one of the fundamental challenges of the CEDAR Aeronomy program, which is to quantify a baseline model of mid-latitude electric fields. Consequently, the question of variability as a function of solar phase, geomagnetic activity, and dynamical coupling to the lower atmosphere and to the magnetosphere regions can be more carefully assessed. The results achieved would be of great interest and use to the ionosphere and thermospheric modeling community and also relevant to the CEDAR mission of ""understanding the fundamental properties of the space-atmosphere interaction region (SAIR); identify the interconnected processes that define the SAIR's global behavior, evolution, and influence on the Sun-Earth system"".  <br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to quantify the response of the ionosphere relative to direct, spectrally separated measurements of solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation from the TIMED and SDO spacecraft. This approach constitutes an immense improvement over previous studies based on proxies. The C/NOFS and DMSP spacecraft at a range of altitudes will provide corresponding measurements of ionospheric parameters. This dataset, spanning more than a solar cycle, allows for the use of advanced statistical analysis techniques and will be used together with the SAMI-2 model to address outstanding science questions related to understanding the ionospheric response to solar EUV variability. Interesting questions to be investigated include the relative importance of and interaction between the responses in the neutral and ionized components of the upper atmosphere."

High quantum yield is a requirement for materials used in optoelectronic devices such as light emitting diodes, lasers, and solar cells. <br/>This EAGER project addresses the quantum yield issue of transition metal chalcogenides (2D material). The PI has demonstrated that the surface defects of MoS2 (2D material) can be repaired/passivated through surface chemical treatments. As a result; the quantum yield can be enhanced from less than 1% to over 95%. The work outlined in this EAGER will seek to demonstrate a functional electro-optic device based on a high quantum yield 2D monolayer.<br/><br/>Technical:<br/>The figure of merit for materials used in optoelectronic systems is their photoluminescence quantum yield (QY). This determines the efficiency of light emission from a population of optically or electrically generated electron hole-pairs and is critically dependent on the defect density/type in the material. Final QY values dictate key performance metrics such as the power consumption in LEDs, threshold currents for semiconductor laser, and the upper limit of open circuit voltage in solar cells. <br/>Two dimensional (2D) semiconductors, suffers from very poor quantum yield (<1%). Recently the PI?s group has addressed this problem of low QY in 2D materials and developed a chemical treatment procedure using an organic super acid which is able to enhance the QY in the most heavily studied 2D system: MoS2 from an initial value <1% in the as exfoliated case to over 95%.<br/>This work shows that the procedure is stable in ambient and does not change other key properties in the material (such as crystal structure, band gap, electrical properties, etc.). The detailed mechanism of the treatment need to be fully understood for this result to realize its full impact. <br/>The PI will address many of these key questions, focusing on: (i) obtaining high QY for additional 2D materials such as WS2, and ReS2 via exploring and optimizing additional chemicals and optimizing the existing treatment procedure for different materials. The demonstration of an optoelectronic device using this technology, specifically a 2D LED, with a high QY will be demonstrated.<br/>This project will involve one graduate and one undergraduate student; the training and mentoring of the undergraduate student in particular will be emphasized.

One reason these groups are thought to be so diverse is because of their interactions with one another. Evolutionary change in plants can impact evolutionary change in insects, and this is likely one mechanism by which new species are formed, a central question in evolutionary biology research. These reciprocal evolutionary responses might be caused by two different types of interactions between plants and insects. One type of interaction, termed mutualism, is mutually beneficial to both species. For example, insect pollinators move pollen among plants as they gather food, and both the plants and insects benefit from this type of interaction. A second type of interaction is antagonism, where one species benefits at the cost of the other.  Insects use of plants as food is an example of antagonism that has led to the evolution of toxic plant chemicals, many of which are used in medical applications. One major unanswered question is whether the diversity of plants and insects observed in nature is mainly the result of mutualistic or antagonistic interactions. Understanding the relative roles of each is critical for predicting how plant and insects will respond to each other through time and will help guide strategies for increasing pollination services provided by insects and reducing the impact of insect pests. In addition, the research will be used in creating a workshop for middle school students through hands-on experiments examining the importance of plant-insect interactions in natural and agricultural settings. <br/><br/>The research will use a textbook example of coevolution and adaptive radiation to test the relative roles of mutualistic and antagonistic coevolution in generating reproductive isolation and speciation. The obligate specialized interaction between yuccas and their yucca moth pollinators has both mutualistic and antagonistic components. Female moths use specialized tentacular mouthparts to collect pollen and actively pollinate yuccas, and then deposit eggs near developing yucca seeds that their larvae eat. The evolution of tentacles has been suggested to be a key innovation in the mutualism and diversification of pollinator moths. Although previous research has highlighted trait divergence in antagonistic traits, there has been no comparative survey of trait divergence in the key mutualistic trait, moth tentacles, or of pollination behavior. Comparative analyses of mutualistic and antagonistic traits will be combined with tests of performance of pollinators on natal vs. non-natal yucca species. Specifically, we will compare the ability of moths to be effective pollinators and herbivores across many yucca species. These analyses will be combined with the examination of mating abilities among host forms of the only generalist moth pollinator species to test if changes in mutualistic or antagonistic traits are instrumental in promoting the formation of reproductive isolation. The project will be the first direct test of how coevolution and the type of species interaction among interacting lineages translates into reproductive isolation and species diversification linking microevolutionary processes with macroevolutionary patterns."

While this scholarship establishes that these institutions are a necessary precondition for change, it leaves open an important question. Namely, are there types of support structures that are more or less effective at producing and facilitating the transfer of these valuable resources to and within movements? Contemporary legal movements provide a unique opportunity to address this question, as their patrons have, since the late-1990s, invested in support institutions representative of three different types - Leveraging, Supplemental, and Parallel Alternative Structures. <br/><br/>This study uses this variation to help forward two models for understanding and assessing the efficacy of different support structure strategies. It does this by collecting and aggregating institutional data from three law schools and one legal training program at the heart of these contemporary legal movements. PIs will supplement these data with evidence gathered from personal interviews, participant observation, and an original survey.  PIs will analyze these data both qualitatively and quantitatively, with the primary methods involving interpretive data analysis and network mapping. This project will provide important insights for scholars and practitioners and will have at least two significant impacts. First, through the development of new models for understanding movements, this project will make a theoretical contribution to the scholarly literature on support structures, legal mobilization, and social movements. Secondly, policy activists who have learned that a support structure is necessary for legal change have little guidance from the literature as to what kinds of support structures will best facilitate the transfer of resources between their movement and policy demanders. This project will help inform this important policy and scholarly conversation."

And while critical advances have been made in understanding the marine iron cycle, a full description remains elusive due to its biogeochemical complexity and the low concentrations of iron in the ocean. The research funded in this project seeks to advance our understanding of the chemical forms of Fe in seawater. This will be done by first refining a novel, selective electrochemical analytical method for looking at Fe at natural concentrations in seawater and then relating the resulting data to the genetic composition of the microbial communities responsible for creating the organic molecules that control the fate and chemical form of Fe in the ocean. We now know that iron is an incredibly important micronutrient to biological communities, and this new approach of linked genomic and analytical data has the potential to provide important insights that will significantly advance the study of iron composition in the ocean. This project will also support two graduate students at Scripps Institute of Oceanography, both participating in a new outreach program with 6th graders initiated by the Birch Aquarium at Scripps. <br/><br/>The importance of iron as a limiting micronutrient in the ocean has become a topic of avid research, and there have been many advances in the field. However, characterizations of iron speciation in seawater are still broad by nature due to the lack of precision in the electrochemical analytical techniques.  Competitive ligand exchange - adsorptive cathodic stripping voltammetry (CLE-ACSV) has been a commonly used technique to study iron speciation in seawater. This research seeks to improve this method by applying CLE-ACSV at multiple analytical windows (MAW) to increase resolution at the strong and weak ends of the iron-binding ligand spectrum. Additionally, by relating data from this technique to data on the metagenomic composition of the resident microbial community, the work should be able to make meaningful connections between the microbial communities that produce the organic ligands that we now know dominate iron speciation, solubility, and uptake in the ocean. This research has the potential to make a significant contribution to the current understanding of iron cycling in seawater, and it will help us to better understand the larger global ocean biogeochemical processes that control the distribution and availability of iron and its controls on global productivity."

When cowpea is combined with starchy grains such as corn, sorghum or rice, the result is a complete source of major nutrients for energy and growth. It also provides protein-rich leaves and is used for animal feed.  Cowpea is the primary source of protein for people in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) where it is presently produced on over 20 million acres mainly by farmers with small land holdings. Its popularity is also due to its resilience to low rainfall and heat while also enriching the soil. Despite its relevance to food security in Africa and elsewhere, there has been relatively little basic research on cowpea. Advances in next generation sequencing technology have made it possible to ""read"" the genetic material of cowpea and decipher the instructions (genes and genetic variation) that ultimately provide for crop improvement.  Producing an optimized reference genome sequence for cowpea is one of the main goals of this project, a feat that has been accomplished for human, mouse, cow and economically important crop plants such as corn, soybean, rice, bean and poplar. A broader purpose is to provide genetic resources to improve decision-making abilities within an existing network of African cowpea breeders. Breeders develop new varieties by making crosses between parents that carry favorable traits and selecting progeny containing favorable characteristics of both parents. This project will provide new materials for progeny selection in addition to knowledge that will facilitate the development of new cowpea varieties for increased food production.<br/> <br/>Cowpea (Vigna unguiculata) is in the family Fabaceae, tribe Phaseoleae which includes other warm season legumes such as soybean, common bean and pigeon pea, as well as Vigna species adzuki bean and mung bean. Cowpea is diploid with 2n=22 chromosomes and a genome size of 620 Mb. Unlike other legumes, cowpea lacks a published reference genome. A highly fragmented draft genome sequence assembly has been available from previous work since 2011 (harvest-blast.org; harvest-web.org) and is derived from 60x short-reads combined with BAC-end and gene survey Sanger sequences. This project will elevate the sequence of cowpea to state-of-the art by: (1) adding long-read sequences and an optical map; (2) anchoring contigs to a recently developed genetic map containing 37,372 SNPs; and (3) improving browser access for the broader legume community. This will enable deeper utilization of cowpea germplasm for gene discovery and marker development, while providing a stronger foundation for the cowpea genetics and breeding community. Genetic intercrosses will be conducted to produce new pre-breeding lines that will theoretically carry optimal combinations of traits present within elite lines using a recently developed multi-parent advanced generation intercross (MAGIC) population based on eight parental lines. Marker-trait information, in the context of the genome sequence and haplotypes, will be disseminated for broad adoption of marker-informed breeding. This work is tightly linked to leading breeding programs in Burkina Faso, Ghana, Mozambique, Nigeria and Senegal through USAID Feed the Future and CGIAR Tropical Legumes projects."

The problem of dating the different stages of composition is often a significant issue, as in the case of early modern scientific and technological manuscripts, which were often separated or even dismembered and reassembled after the author?s death, as with the papers of Leonardo da Vinci, Galileo Galilei, Robert Boyle, and Isaac Newton, to name just a few. A solution to the problems posed by dating large manuscript corpora would therefore be of benefit to researchers in many areas scholarship, not to mention librarians and museum workers. The present proposal aims to use Isaac Newton?s very large manuscript Nachlass as a platform for exploring multiple techniques, including computational techniques and others, for dating manuscripts and for assessing them in combination with one another.  In addition to providing important historical information that will enable scholars to come to grips with the chronological development of Newton?s chymical corpus, which is of substantial public interest as well as of scholarly interest, the tools and approaches that are to be used in this project will be transportable to all other projects that contain undated manuscript material in any field of inquiry, not just the history of science. A final impact of the proposal will be to further public awareness of Newton?s chymical research, an area that will help to stimulate interest in science in an audience that ranges from K-12 students up to professionals with widely diverse intellectual interests.<br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>The techniques that are to be used in this project include comparison of parallel passages generated automatically by a barrage of computational techniques (e.g. Latent Semantic Analysis and Topic Modeling), spectro-metric analysis of inks and papers by Raman spectroscopy, comparison of watermarks by means of the latest imaging technologies, tracking of developments in orthography and handwriting, and the systematic study of citations, facilitated by the production of an authoritative electronic bibliography with hyperlinks to the citations in texts. In addition to applying these multiple techniques, the project will follow an integrative approach to assessing the data generated by them. In order to achieve this result, the project will use network graph analysis to produce visual clusters of manuscripts and passages whose respective chronological markers correlate with one another. Correlations generated by independent test-runs employing different techniques (e.g. ink-analysis and watermark-analysis) will then be compared to one another, using image graphs. In cases where a clean overlay of graphs does not result, team members will revisit the data and determine the cause of the poor ?fit.? Metrical techniques will also be developed for determining the degree of agreement that constitutes good versus poor fit. The result will be a model for determining relative chronology of the parts within large textual corpora that will be transportable to other projects."

This project will select and re-sequence 506 accessions of cotton (and its wild, diploid relatives). These DNA sequences will be used to identify individual plants that contain unique genetic diversity. The understanding of genetic diversity will illuminate basic biological processes in cotton and will provide genomic resources for improvement of the domestic cotton crop. This project will also provide summer research training internships for teachers (grades 7-12) at both Brigham Young University and Iowa State University.  The program will introduce the conceptual and experimental foundations of genome analysis strategies. Teachers will then be able to share their knowledge of genome sequencing with their high school and middle school students.<br/><br/>The amount and apportionment of genetic diversity in domesticated plants and their wild relatives are key concerns for crop improvement.

Sequence reads generated through high-coverage sequencing of DNA libraries for each accession will be mapped to the reference cotton genome using a variety of computational tools to begin to identify and quantify nucleotide variation along chromosomes of various accessions.  Population genomics analyses will reveal unique alleles, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), copy number variants (CNVs) in accessions within the public cotton germplasm collection. Using this information, a pan-genome of cotton will be synthesized to better understand the scope, pace, and pattern of genomic variations that arise during speciation, population differentiation, and domestication and breeding.

Chirality is ubiquitous in nature and best known in looking at our own left and right hands. It is also found in many sugar molecules, amino acids and in larger proteins, nucleic acids and viruses, where chirality has a profound effect on function; for example chiral molecules behave differently in chemical reactions and in their interaction with polarized light. Inspired by natural chiral molecules, artificial chiral plasmonic nanostructures are explored to exploit their strong light interaction and realize 'giant' optical responses for applications including biosensing, light emission, and light manipulation. The realization of chiral plasmonic nanostructures requires plasmonic materials to be shaped into complex, subwavelength, three-dimensional architectures. However, it is not trivial to fabricate high densities of these nanostructures over the large areas required. This award will unite top-down fabrication and bottom-up assembly to realize chiral plasmonic nanostructures that have strong, polarization-dependent optical properties. By exploiting the disparate physical properties of bulk and nanocrystalline materials, chiral materials that are responsive to optical and magnetic stimuli will be created.  The team will utilize the simplicity of these fabrication technologies to design a new optical device fabrication lab to make the field accessible to K-12 and undergraduate students participating in science festivals, camps, and formal curricula. The team will also share career experiences to encourage women to pursue careers in science and engineering. <br/> <br/>Optical metamaterials enable unprecedented control of light by engineering the size, shape, and physical properties of matter, artificially structured from plasmonic and non-plasmonic building-blocks with nanometer scale precision. Among them, chiral plasmonic metamaterials combine strong light-matter interactions with the unique polarization selectivity created by their structural handedness. This award aims to advance the nanoscale manufacturing of large-area, multi-functional, three-dimensional, chiral plasmonic nanostructures by exploiting size- and shape-engineered templates defined by nanoimprint lithography and the different deposition processes and properties of bulk and nanocrystal thin films. By combining angle-selective, shadow evaporation of bulk metal thin films with the isotropic deposition of colloidal nanocrystal thin films, hierarchal, chiral nanostructures will be created. Taking advantage of the distinct chemical and structural properties of bulk and nanocrystal thin films, stress will be exploited to drive buckling of bulk metal/nanocrystal nanostructures and thereby turn planar two-dimensional into three-dimensional, chiral nanostructures. By integrating different bulk and nanocrystal materials, strong polarization-dependent and optically and magnetically responsive chiral materials will be realized."

This project aims to link Prochlorococcus community structure to primary productivity in situ. The twelve known Prochlorococcus ecotypes exhibit extensive diversity. It is thought that this diversity allows the Prochlorococcus ""collective"" to maintain numerical dominance across gradients in light, nutrients, and temperature that accompany changes in depth, season, and latitude. A large gap in our understanding lies in whether we should assess the ecosystem value of Prochlorococcus by its abundance or by its community structure or both. Ecosystem models assign all ecotypes the same role. However, genomic and physiological evidence from cultivated isolates and wild populations suggests tentatively that distinct genotypes may contribute differently to the ecosystem through variation in light and nutrient physiologies and interactions with other microorganisms.  The consequences of these molecular-level differences to primary productivity in situ are unknown. This project tests whether absolute abundance, or community structure, determines the contributions of Prochlorococcus to biogeochemical dynamics by measuring the contributions of different ecotypes to primary productivity. The results of this project will inform ecosystem models towards better representation of how shifts in climate and Prochlorococcus diversity will affect global nutrient cycles, trophic cascades, and interactions with other bacteria, viruses, and grazers. The insights and approaches delineated by this work will be generally applicable to the ecology of abundant microbial populations in the open ocean such as pigmented and non-pigmented eukaryotes, heterotrophic bacteria, and other cyanobacterial lineages. A basic understanding of differences between coexisting ecotypes will provide inroads into understanding mechanisms of cooperation, competition, and collaboration among ecotypes in all microbial ecosystems. The investigators will build a teaching module to expose high school students to microbial oceanography, big data, and systems biology through virtual ocean exploration. The primary objective will be to impress upon students the importance of an ""invisible forest"" of microorganisms in the ocean. Students will examine the distribution patterns of abundant microbial groups in the context of oceanographic data from large publically available databases. High school teachers and student interns, a graduate student, the investigators, and an educational specialist will design, implement, and test the module for classrooms nationwide. This effort will follow a successful education model (Systems Education Experience - SEE) developed previously.<br/><br/>The investigators will address an overarching hypothesis that Prochlorococcus ecotypes vary in their contribution to the ecosystem as primary producers. More specifically, the investigators hypothesize that patterns of cell division and carbon fixation vary between coexisting ecotypes, and these differences are a function of genome content, gene expression, environmental conditions, and community composition. The technical approach will involve two field-based experiments will be applied to three different depths, at the oceanographic Station ALOHA, that differ in Prochlorococcus community composition.  Experiment 1 will examine whether coexisting ecotypes vary in cell division, using 16S rRNA sequencing to quantify ecotype abundance in G1, S, and G2 cells. Experiment 2 will examine how carbon fixation varies between coexisting ecotypes using RNA-stable isotope probing and 16S rRNA sequencing of RNA enriched in 13C after incubation with 13C-bicarbonate. These experiments will be performed with Prochlorococcus communities under native in situ conditions and shifts in conditions to mimic light and temperature of other depths. In both experiments, the temporal gene expression of a selected set of carbon fixation and cell division genes will be examined to link gene expression patterns to primary productivity. All data will be related to the oceanographic environment including its physical, chemical, and biological features."

Proton beam cancer therapies work by targeting cancer cells with high-energy protons.  These protons damage the cancer cells by breaking the double strands of their DNA.    In recent years, other particles, such as alpha-particles and carbon-ions, have been considered as alternatives to protons for cancer therapies.  The energetic protons or other particles transfer their energy to the water and DNA by exciting their electrons.  There is a strong need for a better understanding of the energy transfer process and electronic excitation process.  Using massively parallel computers, Kanai and his research group develop and apply computational methods for simulating the energy transfer and electronic excitation process.  Both graduate students and undergraduate students participate in this research.<br/><br/>A new large-scale, real-time, time-dependent density functional theory (TDDFT) method is employed to study electronic excitation dynamics in liquid water and solvated DNA under proton, alpha-particle and carbon-ion irradiation. The energy transfer from the high-energy ions depends significantly on the particle velocity.  The perturbing electric field from the energetic ion is highly heterogeneous at the molecular scale. Using the real-time TDDFT method, the excitation process is investigated in detail as a function of the ion velocity and type (protons, alpha-particles, and carbon-ions). The energy transfer rate from the ions to electronic excitations in liquid water is determined from non-equilibrium simulations, and a microscopic understanding of the excitation dynamics in liquid water and solvated DNA is developed. Improving scalability of real-time TDDFT code on massively parallel computers and the exchange-correlation approximation for describing the dynamical energy transfer process are two important aspects of this investigation. Dr. Kanai also develops novel teaching computational tools for teaching time-dependent quantum mechanics in advanced chemistry courses."

The impact of this uptake in the marine environment is lessened by the dissolution of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) to calcium and carbonate ions, allowing carbonate ions to bind free hydrogen ions that cause the decrease in pH.  Researchers from the University of Southern California and California Institute of Technology have developed a new method for determining carbonate dissolution rates that work in both laboratory and field settings.  Preliminary data using this technique has revealed a distinct difference in measured rates between those obtained in the laboratory and those in the field.  It is crucial that laboratory and field measurements be standardized to be able to accurately study and compare dissolution rate studies. As such, the researchers will perform extensive fieldwork and laboratory to bridge the gap between these dissolution rate measurements.  Results will be widely useful to the ocean chemistry community, especially modelers, wishing to study any aspect of ocean carbonate chemistry, as well as paleoceanographers using carbonate material to study past ocean conditions.  Graduate students will be co-mentored by the researchers, and the University of Southern California?s (USC) Young Researcher Program will allow the researchers to involve local high school students. USC International Relations students will be involved in the project, not only gaining scientific experience, but also will learn the policy aspect of the science.<br/><br/>Calcium carbonate (CaCO3) dissolution helps to mitigate the effects of ocean acidification (OA) and is a key factor in the ocean?s alkalinity balance. The researchers have recently developed a novel tracer methodology which can monitor carbonate dissolution rates in both the lab and field. This method traces the transfer of 13C from labeled solids to seawater. Using this method has led to breakthroughs in understanding the controls of CaCO3 dissolution kinetics, but it has also revealed that the measurements made in a lab and in the field are not entirely in line. It is crucial to be able to correlate these two measurements to be able to fully study and understand the dynamics of CaCO3 dissolution. Therefore, the researchers will extend their previous work to standardize the results of measurements in the lab with those in the ocean. The North Pacific Ocean with a gradient in carbonate saturation states will be used for the field study, and lab-based experiments will allow the researchers to constrain variables such as pressure, the dissolved inorganic carbon/alkalinity ratio, and concentrations of phosphate. This research will further understanding of OA, the mechanisms controlling carbonate dissolution, and how the ocean modulates its alkalinity budget."

However, the connection between a male's level of intelligence and external traits that females can assess has been difficult to measure. Here the researchers will assess spatial memory ability, an intelligence trait thought to increase survival in wild food-storing birds, and two overt male signals, feather coloration and song production, to address the question of whether or not female mating choice is associated with these traits. The researchers will conduct the experiments with free-living birds using arrays of programmable 'smart' bird feeders that can track which individuals are using these feeders to test spatial learning ability. The researchers will then test whether individual variation in learning is associated with variation in communication signals and with mate choice. Findings from this work can be applied to a wide variety of species, including humans, that must make important decisions when using information that isn't always easily assessed or tangible.  All of the results and findings will be widely available to a variety of audiences through publication in peer-reviewed journals and participation in professional conferences. Additionally, this work will support the research experience of undergraduate students and the equipment used in this project will also be used in public outreach activities in the community, including creating a museum display at the University of Nevada's Museum of Natural History that illustrates the differences in human and non-human.<br/><br/>Signals are universally used across taxa to convey a diverse range of information, including social status, foraging locations, and predator presence. Several hypotheses have been proposed regarding how sexual signals of quality, in particular, have evolved to be honest as these signals are only useful insofar as they reflect some fitness associated trait(s) of the sender. Cognitive ability is one such fitness-related trait, yet direct evidence linking cognitive ability, signaling, and associated fitness consequences of female mating choices have historically been difficult to assess. Using wild birds fitted with passive integrated transponder leg bands and radio-frequency identification technology, the researchers will directly test whether (a) individual variation in a cognitive ability is associated with variation in two modes of signaling perceivable by females and (b) whether variation in cognitive ability and these two signals reflect female mating choices via production of extra-pair offspring. By doing so, the researchers will connect a cognitive trait thought to increase survival, with song production and plumage reflectance, to female mating choices in wild food-caching birds. These birds inhabit differentially harsh environments creating differential selection pressures on spatial memory ability used to retrieve cached food. Using this system the researchers will be able to directly test the assumption that signals reflect individual quality, an assumption that has been somewhat intangible in the past."

By creating mobile friendly flight planning applications, it puts the farmers in control of their fields. As a result, a drone can fly a specified field (up to 250 acres), collect aerial imagery, and the management system will display an updated map with an aerial representation of the current state of the farmers' fields. With the use of a multispectral camera, the proposed system can detect light frequencies from the canopy of the crops. Those light frequencies can be quantified by a NASA derived index (NDVI) where the current health of each acre can be determined. Over time, this I-Corps team expects to see the platform transform into an insight based application that saves the farmer time, money, and possibly even crops.<br/><br/>This I-Corps team has created a mobile application that can communicate a flight plan to any off-the-shelf drone. The app allows farmers to define their fields and automatically generates the flight plan on their behalf. This means that a farmer can easily procure the drone through their preferred channel, and get it collecting data on their fields without having to worry about learning to pilot the drone. The app allows fields to be bound, defined, and labeled so an operator can simply click a given field and an optimal flight plan is generated. The flight plan allows the operator to determine at which altitude they wish to operate, and the algorithm alters the flight plan accordingly. The proposed system is in the process of evolving beyond an image mosaicking and flight planning application into an analytics engine that can generate prescription recommendations for the farmers' fields. This application leverages historic weather data, as well as scraping real time weather data, to aggregate heat units in order to predict optimal actions for the farmers, such as harvest. With near real-time imaging, historic weather data, and ground based sensor data the team believes they will be able to more effectively predict and optimize yield. The I-Corps program will allow the team to understand which specific crops they can most effectively service, prioritize their feature development, and elucidate more thoroughly on their go-to-market strategy."

It is aimed at understanding the behavior of atmospheric regions from the middle atmosphere upward through the ionized upper layers of the atmosphere and into outer space in terms of coupling, energetics, chemistry, and dynamics on regional and global scales. The mid-latitude ionosphere serves as the intermediary between the active ionospheres of the polar and equatorial regions, but it has not been studied very thoroughly. This Collaborative CEDAR award involving University of Texas at Dallas, Virginia Tech University, and the University of Colorado is aimed at developing the first quiet-time empirical model of the ionosphere electric field distribution to fill in the necessary ground truth needed to produce a true understanding of the global dynamics of the ionosphere. The research effort would use 15 years of Air Force Defense Meteorological Space Plasma (DMSP) measurements of ion zonal flow speeds in the mid-latitude ionosphere to construct an empirical model of mid-latitude ionospheric quiet-time electric fields. This data set would be supplemented by ion drift data obtained from the mid-latitude SuperDARN sites. This database would be made available to outside users, and thus, would be a valuable ionospheric community resource. Following the completion of the development of the quiet time model, observations from storm times will be compared to predictions based upon application of the new quiet time model. The determined differences would be analyzed within the guidance and context of the CTIP (Coupled thermosphere ionosphere plasmasphere)-RCM model runs to understand the underlying physical mechanisms causing the observed variability relative to the baseline model established, to quantify the magnitude and extent of storm-time disturbances, and finally, to quantify the coupling of the mid-latitude ion drifts to the neutral atmosphere and the transfer of energy between the polar and equatorial regions. Finally, making use of nearly two decades of DMSP data to understand and develop empirical models goes to the heart of one of the fundamental challenges of the CEDAR Aeronomy program, which is to quantify a baseline model of mid-latitude electric fields. Consequently, the question of variability as a function of solar phase, geomagnetic activity, and dynamical coupling to the lower atmosphere and to the magnetosphere regions can be more carefully assessed. The results achieved would be of great interest and use to the ionosphere and thermospheric modeling community and also relevant to the CEDAR mission of ""understanding the fundamental properties of the space-atmosphere interaction region (SAIR); identify the interconnected processes that define the SAIR's global behavior, evolution, and influence on the Sun-Earth system"".  <br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to quantify the response of the ionosphere relative to direct, spectrally separated measurements of solar extreme ultraviolet (EUV) radiation from the TIMED and SDO spacecraft. This approach constitutes an immense improvement over previous studies based on proxies. The C/NOFS and DMSP spacecraft at a range of altitudes will provide corresponding measurements of ionospheric parameters. This dataset, spanning more than a solar cycle, allows for the use of advanced statistical analysis techniques and will be used together with the SAMI-2 model to address outstanding science questions related to understanding the ionospheric response to solar EUV variability. Interesting questions to be investigated include the relative importance of and interaction between the responses in the neutral and ionized components of the upper atmosphere."

Ice streams and outlet glaciers are the major pathways for ice discharge from ice sheets into the ocean. Consequently, understanding ice stream dynamics, specifically the processes controlling the frictional resistance of ice sliding on sediments at its base, is essential for predictive modeling of how Earth's ice sheets will respond to a changing climate. Rather than flowing smoothly, Whillans Ice Stream advances in stick-slip cycles: brief periods of rapid sliding, equivalent to magnitude 7 earthquakes, alternating with much longer periods of repose. The PIs will perform simulations of these stick-slip cycles using computer codes originally developed for modeling tectonic earthquakes. By matching observed ice motions, the PIs will constrain the range of frictional processes acting at the base of the ice stream. An additional focus of the project is on brittle fracture processes in ice, expressed through seismic waves radiated by faulting and/or crevassing episodes that accompany the large-scale sliding events. An understanding of ice fracture provides a basis for assessing the susceptibility of ice shelves to rifting and catastrophic disintegration. Project results will be incorporated into outreach activities (from elementary school to community college events) as well as a polar science class for the California State Summer School for Mathematics and Science (COSMOS) program for high school students.<br/><br/>Simulations of the stick-slip cycle will employ 3D dynamic rupture models that simultaneously solve for the seismic wavefield and rupture process, consistent with elastodynamic material response and friction laws on the ice stream bed. Stresses and frictional properties will be varied to achieve consistency with surface GPS and broadband seismic data as well as borehole seismograms from the WISSARD project. The results will be interpreted using laboratory till friction experiments, which link velocity-weakening/strengthening behavior to temperature and water content, and to related experiments quantifying basal drag from ice flow over rough beds. The source mechanism of seismicity accompanying the slip events (shear faulting versus crevassing) will be determined using 3D waveform modeling in conjunction with mechanical models of the seismic source processes.  This proposal does not require fieldwork in the Antarctic."

The conference will foster networking and collaboration among an international assemblage of geologists, geographers, and soil scientists whose research interests focus on loess, which is an eolian sediment largely consisting of wind-blown silt.  Because of its distinctive character and origin, loess has been the topic of considerable research in geography, geomorphology, and soil science.  The conference will bring together scholars from around the world to share results from recent research, discuss topics and issues of mutual interest, and provide opportunities for scholars to explore possibilities for new collaborative relationships.  Although a series of conferences focusing on loess have been convened periodically since 1999, this will be the first such gathering in North America.  The conference will provide an opportunity to highlight much of the loess research in the mid-continental U.S. being done by U.S. researchers to an international audience, and it will provide a venue within which many Americans, who often do not interact directly with loess scholars in Europe and China, to meet, network, and collaborate.  In addition to facilitating interactions among scholars from different nations, the conference will catalyze advances in loess science that will enable better mapping and use of the distinctive soils associated with loess, and it will promote research in loess areas that have received little research attention in the past.<br/><br/>Many of the soils in the richest agricultural parts of the world are formed in loess, which means that research about the geology and spatial properties of loess provides important information about past geologic and climatic conditions wherever it is found.  The conference is expected to attract between 125 and 150 scholars, and it will be one of a number of gatherings preceding the annual meeting of the Geological Society of America in Denver.  The conference will be conducted over four days, with two days in meeting rooms and two days at field sites where scholars will be able to examine representative loess-based features firsthand.  Topics of special emphasis during indoor and field-based discussions will be on fluvial and glacial systems as loess sources; on the role of loess in regions with only thin veneers of wind-blown sediments; and on loess landscapes, eolian transportational systems, and the concept of loess transport surfaces."

Becraft (Iowa State University), Joanne M. Dannenhoffer (Central Michigan University), and Gary N. Drews (University of Utah)<br/><br/>Endosperm is a major component of the seed, and is biologically and economically important. In all angiosperms, endosperm provides nutrients and signals to the embryo during seed development. In cereal grains, endosperm composes a large proportion of the mature seed, and contains large amounts of carbohydrates and proteins, which provide more than 50% of the calories in the human diet, either directly or indirectly through animal feed. Cereal endosperm also serves as a raw material for manufacturing important industrial products, including ethanol. Maize is an excellent model system for molecular genetic analysis of cereal endosperm and is the primary subject of this research project which focuses on maize early endosperm development, encompassing the time when the endosperm grows from a single cell into a multicellular structure composed of different specialized cell types.  Although the molecular mechanisms that control this developmental period have not been elucidated, they are likely to affect many economically important processes including, but not limited to, the regulation of seed size, and accumulation of starch and protein during grain filling. In addition to the training of students and postdoctoral associates, the project will provide summer research training internships for undergraduate students from Central Michigan University.      <br/><br/>To identify genetic pathways that control endosperm cell differentiation, gene expression profiling will be performed on each endosperm cell type at multiple time points; this will be accomplished through a combination of laser-capture microdissection to collect specific endosperm cell types and the RNA-seq method (high throughput sequencing of cDNA) to identify all the genes expressed in the collected tissues. This information will be used as a framework for gene-network analysis in two of the endosperm cell types: the starchy endosperm and basal transfer layer. Starchy endosperm is the major repository for starch and protein accumulation, while the basal transfer layer is important for transporting sugar and amino acid building blocks into the growing grain; both tissues are important for grain yield and quality. The gene networks will be revealed by performing gene co-expression analysis and key transcription factors will be studied with protein-DNA assays and genetic analyses.  Early endosperm development is highly sensitive to drought stress which can decrease grain yield, even if favorable moisture conditions are restored. To identify the gene-expression perturbations caused by drought stress in maize kernels, gene expression profiling will be performed with kernels from drought-stressed plants. In addition, this project will profile the genes expressed during early endosperm development in a closely related cereal, sorghum, and use comparative genomics with maize to reveal fundamental and species-specific aspects of endosperm development. Data generated can be accessed through the project website (www.grainendosperm.org) as well as through long-term repositories such as MaizeGDB and NCBI's GEO and SRA."

Wildfires chemically transform soil organic matter, and mountainous slopes are more prone to erosion after wildfires. Increased sediment transport can lead to increased deposition and accumulation of pyrogenic soil organic matter in surface waters (i.e., rivers and lakes), and the concern is that dissolved organic matter characteristics from wildfires affects the formation of disinfection byproducts. The results from this research will provide beneficial information for utility operators, managers, researchers, and regulators.<br/><br/>Wildfires in forested watersheds transform ecosystems and affect surface water quality. Previous work by the principal investigator (PI) demonstrated that leachates from sediments in wildfire-impacted areas have a greater potential (i.e., increased yield of disinfection byproducts) to form haloacetonitriles after chlorination. Haloacetonitriles, along with other nitrogenous disinfection byproducts, are an emerging area of concern. Although not yet regulated by the USEPA, haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides are more toxic than regulated carbonaceous disinfection byproducts. The proposed study investigates the effect of thermal processes on the formation of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts (haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides) from soil organic matter. Soil organic matter is nitrogen-rich, containing peptide-like material from in situ microbial processes. Soil organic nitrogen is transformed into cyclic dipeptides and heterocyclic aromatic compounds by thermal processes. The objectives are to simulate the transformation of organic matter due to thermal processes, leaching into surface water, and the formation of disinfection byproducts during disinfection processes. Samples will be collected from burned and unburned locations within a wildfire-impacted watershed. Organic nitrogen characterization (i.e., amino acid and NMR analysis) will be used to elucidate which organic nitrogen characteristics are associated with increased haloacetonitriles and haloacetamide formation. In addition to high quality publications, the students involved in this research will have the opportunity to operate the analytical equipment required to produce the needed data during the new Laboratory class that will be designed as an outcome of this project. This will enhance the quality of the teaching and training derived from this proposal. Additionally, the PI is committed to promote the dissemination of these research results through several organizations, such as the Front Range Drinking Water Consortium and the Water Research Foundation."

Work conducted in the principal investigator's (PI's) laboratory at the University of South Carolina suggests that the mobility of carbon nanotubes, examples of engineered nanomaterials, may be significant in waste environments containing ""mature"" leachate (consisting primarily of humic acid). The main goal of this research is to conduct experiments and perform molecular modeling simulations to understand the implications associated with engineered nanomaterial-geomembrane interactions in municipal solid waste landfills.<br/><br/>Engineered nanomaterial production continues to increase: therefore it is inevitable that engineered nanomaterial-containing products/wastes will end up in landfills. Unfortunately, there are no processes or research to evaluate whether currently designed and operating landfills and leachate treatment/storage ponds can adequately manage/contain these materials. Of particular importance is the understanding of how engineered nanomaterials may interact with the geosynthetics present in the liners. This work will elucidate the impact of engineered nanomaterials on high-density polyethylene geomembranes and importantly, how they may influence geomembrane durability/service lives. This research is transformative in that it is the first study in which engineered nanomaterial-high-density polyethylene liner interactions will be explored. Results will provide necessary information to assess whether current solid waste management processes are adequate to safely manage/contain such wastes. The research results will be widely disseminated via presentations and publications. This project is guided by the hypothesis that engineered nanomaterials will influence long-term stability of geomembranes by increasing antioxidant release/depletion. The nature of engineered nanomaterial influences on geomembranes are dependent on material application (e.g., landfill bottom liner or leachate storage pond) and environmental conditions (e.g., oxygen presence). The specific objectives of this work are: (1) Elucidate how selected engineered nanomaterials influence polymer oxidation, antioxidant diffusion, and subsequent changes in mechanical behavior of high-density polyethylene liners; (2) Understand how engineered nanomaterial surface chemistry influences polymer oxidation and antioxidant diffusion; and, (3) Perform molecular level simulations to calculate adsorption/partitioning coefficients, quantify diffusion coefficients, and calculate reaction kinetics for oxidation reactions, and develop a process model to quantify the effects of engineered nanomaterials on antioxidant depletion in high-density polyethylene liners. The PI is committed to promoting teaching, training, and learning while conducting this research. The broader impacts plan is comprised of three components: (1) K-12 outreach; (2) undergraduate research experiences for underrepresented populations in engineering; and, (3) doctoral student mentoring.

The 2016 conference theme is Opportunities for Aquatic Sciences to Impact a Changing World and will focus on the critical contributions that aquatic sciences will make in a world experiencing climate, population, and resource pressures. The conference will bring together 180 participants from multiple countries in an informal setting. The program will consist of plenary talks by established and emerging researchers who are conducting the most innovative and significant research on diverse aspects of environmental aquatic science. <br/><br/>In 2016, the Gordon Research Conference on Environmental Sciences: Water, will continue its long tradition of surveying priority and emerging issues across all aspects of aquatic environmental science. The scope will span multiple disciplines (chemistry, biology, geology, engineering, toxicology, human health), media (soil, groundwater, surface water, atmospheric water, drinking water, wastewater), and scales (molecular, nano, cellular, ecosystem, global). The overarching theme of the 2016 conference recognizes that many of the challenges are intimately linked to water. This proposal advances NSF's broader mission in several ways. First, there are direct societal benefits that arise from the major application of work to be presented at the conference. The need for sufficient amounts of water of appropriate quality for human activities and protection of ecosystem health will be just one discussed benefit.. Solutions to these problems require ideas from, and interactions among, multiple disciplines to allow proper action and development of environmental policy. Second, the conference advances discovery while promoting teaching, training, and learning by offering a platform for graduate student and postdoctoral researchers to present their research and participate fully in the conference activities. The conference also provides a forum for interactions between senior scientists and students and broad participation of scientists from groups underrepresented in science and engineering. The conference format provides an unusual and ideal means for the dissemination of research results through close interaction of participants from industry, government laboratories, and academia. Finally, the conference promotes broad participation from diverse backgrounds, both through the speaker selection and through special Gordon Research Conference funding mechanisms that target underrepresented groups. Assessment of the broader impacts will be performed via survey of participants at the conference."

Today, salmon make up the largest proportion of wild foods harvested by rural Alaskans, but the availability of this important subsistence resource is declining in many upriver areas. Research on prehistoric salmon abundance and use can provide data critical to understanding natural variation in salmon availability and how northern riverine peoples have responded to fluctuations in this important resource in the past.  By providing a long-term perspective for sustainability and food security planning, project data will benefit a variety of salmon stakeholders within Alaska and beyond. The project has a strong educational component, including the development and delivery of a project-based course for the Rural Alaska Honors Institute (a college preparatory program for rural and Alaska Native college-bound students), thus enhancing opportunities for underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This project will address three questions:  (1) How has salmon abundance varied over time in central Alaska? (2) When did prehistoric foragers begin to use salmon, and when did they begin to intensively exploit this resource? (3) How did foragers respond to changes in salmon availability? To address these questions, a multidisciplinary team will use independent approaches: (a) stable isotope analysis of human and faunal remains will reveal the contribution of salmon to the diets of prehistoric salmon consumers (e.g., humans, dogs, bears); (b) zooarchaeological and ancient DNA analyses of fish remains from existing faunal assemblages will allow reconstruction of past fish procurement and processing strategies; and (c) stable isotope analysis of interior lake sediment cores will track natural fluctuations in salmon abundance.  These data will be integrated with models of forager economy and mobility to explore cultural responses to salmon abundance through multiple prehistoric periods. This research will provide the necessary faunal isotope data to accurately reconstruct overall paleodiets of newly discovered multiple human individuals at the interior sites of Upward Sun River (~11,500 yrs old) and Tochak (~1000 yrs old), where faunal and initial isotopic data suggest significant salmon use.  This project provides unprecedented time depth on natural variation in salmon abundance in the North Pacific and in understanding how northern peoples have responded to changes in this critical resource in the past. The study will produce much-needed direct data bearing on prehistoric subsistence strategies in the Alaskan interior throughout the period of human occupation."

The project will focus on the complex interplay among farming philosophies, access to resources, and participation in local and regional food systems.  It also will examine how these factors influence farmer decision making and soil fertility on participating farms.  This project will provide new information regarding the human-environment aspects of agricultural sustainability and insight into the potential for local and regional food system activities like farmers markets to address the challenges of reducing adverse environmental impacts of food production and improving agricultural sustainability. The special attention given to phosphorus will yield new findings regarding the ability of local and regional food systems to break from dependence on non-renewable sources of fertilizer and prevent excessive application of nutrients that can damage connected ecosystems. Findings will be delivered directly to farmers and other engaged in local and regional food systems to help improve their practices as well as to sustainable farming associations and non-profits that work to connect farmers with resources needed to strengthen local and regional food systems.  The results of this research therefore will advance basic scientific understanding about soil sustainability and will assist farmers, policy makers, and food system advocates as they work to ensure the long-term viability of the food system.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>Soils are one of the most important resources for food production and agricultural sustainability, but many aspects of soil sustainability still are poorly understood.  One of these issues is the ability of local and regional food systems to produce more sustainable soil fertility.  In conducting this project, the doctoral student whose dissertation research will be supported will use semi-structured interviews, soil analysis, and geospatial techniques to answer three core questions:  (1) How do farmers participating in a local and regional food systems manage their soil fertility?  (2) How does participation in a local and regional food systems influence soil fertility management decisions?  (3) How resilient is the soil fertility of local and regional food systems?  The student will integrate information from interviews with the results of soil testing for statistical analysis to better understand how social and ecological factors interact and contribute to sustainable soil fertility.  Interview analysis will identify key challenges and successes in sustainable soil management and provide greater context for statistical analysis.  Geospatial techniques will be used to map and analyze degrees of farmer dependence on non-renewable fertilizers.  This student will analyze regional farmers market networks based in New York City, but the research framework and findings will have applications in local and regional food systems in many other regions of North America and elsewhere."

Archaeology provides a unique time depth for analyzing the processes of population aggregation and dispersal and can prove informative on a range of questions concerning the social implications of village life. How do previously dispersed social groups adjust to cohabitation? How is integration achieved and at what pace does it occur when new groups of people come together to construct new villages and other spatial units? Do certain events or forms of organization foreshadow village depopulation? This research attempts to better understand the negotiations among distinct groups as they begin sharing space. Research focused on architecture has revealed important aspects of cultural systems that shape and are shaped by their physical setting. Migration plays a major role in the world today -- for example in many regions of the developing world people flock from rural regions to reshape and expand cities -- and this proposed study of the past can provide insight into the process as it proceeds on a much expanded scale today.<br/><br/>Dr. E Charles Adams and Samantha Fladd will examine the strategies used by groups to modify their spatial setting and the social implications these choices have on the creation and dissolution of a community. Using excavation records from the 14th century ancestral Hopi villages of the Homol'ovi Settlement Cluster, architectural alterations, such as changing room size, internal features, and doorways, and the use of trash to fill rooms will be located spatially and temporally. Significant reorganization throughout the occupation of the villages and their eventual depopulation resulted in frequent architectural changes and the frequent deposition of cultural materials within rooms. Patterns in the composition and scale of these practices of modification will allow for distinctions to be made among social groups within the villages, as well as allow for the assessment of their relative interactions with one another. Depopulation of these villages was gradual and modifications to space, particularly the filling of rooms, illustrate this process. How these groups and relationships change throughout village occupation can reveal fluctuations in social organization that shed light on the relative success of strategies of integration during different phases of aggregation and dispersal. Detailed models of village aggregation and dissolution, applicable to historic and modern contexts, will be generated and a greater understanding of the history of the Homol'ovi Settlement Cluster will be of interest to scholars and descendant communities. Additionally, this research relies on records from previously excavated sites, furthering the ideals of preservation and stewardship central to archaeology and increasing the accessibility to the excavation documentation. Finally, the framework of this project forefronts the training of students in archaeological research and archival practices."

The whole process is expensive and often takes months to complete. This I-Corps team creates a groundbreaking technology, Real-time In-situ Subsurface Imaging (RISI), for imaging subsurface dynamics in real-time (e.g., seconds to minutes). A RISI system can be said as a ""subsurface camera and video camera"" that records the subsurface dynamics in a snap - a technology milestone and invention to be written in the history. Such a technology can be applied to a wide range of subsurface exploration topics such as oil/gas exploration and production, hydrothermal, CO2 storage, mining safety, border security and civil engineering applications.<br/><br/>The RISI technology is a groundbreaking technology that integrates interdisciplinary innovations on distributed computing and signal processing, geophysical imaging and mesh networking technology. Instead of collecting data to a central server for post-processing, the distributed data processing and computing are performed in-situ under resource constraints. Such an approach has never been attempted before and represents a major achievement for both earth and computer science. In sharp contrast to present-time technology, the RISI system significantly reduces the whole process from months/days to seconds, and its deployment and maintenance costs are near zero, as a RISI system is autonomous, self-healing and self-sustainable, and requires little intervention during operations. The I-Corps program will provide insight through customer interviews of the viability of the RISI technology in the marketplace, information regarding desired instrument design attributes, funds for technology development, and a transition plan for commercializing the technology. It will be a great education and outreach experiences for faculty and students involved, and promote the entrepreneurship in the GSU and the broader technical community of Atlanta."

Domestic violence is a significant barrier to the economic and social development of women, families and communities across the globe and is a key area of concern for US policy makers.  The project focuses on an urban community in Costa Rica that was planned and designed 20 years ago as an innovative solution to the problem of domestic violence.  The planning process at its core was informed by anti-violence organizing.  As such it offers an opportunity to look at the relationship between the built environment and the social milieu surrounding violence across generations.  This project is thus a reflective study on how successful a design approach is for addressing domestic violence. By studying the effects of design on the behaviors and attitudes of a residential community this project will connect community, home and interpersonal practices to regional and national policies.  A key output of this project will be a set of resources for creating community level responses to domestic violence that can be taken up and employed by both policy makers and local organizations within the US and other countries. These resources, in addition to the oral histories and case study data, will be made available to the public in both English and Spanish through an online portal.  This portal will also be valuable for engaging undergraduate students in courses on urban planning, politics and gender.<br/><br/>This project will contribute to scholarship on the relationship between urban planning, vernacular landscapes, and everyday practices.  The study brings together literatures on geopolitics, social movement organizing, feminist planning, landscape analysis and memory studies in a conceptual framework that enables the exploration of how anti-violence organizing can be sustained across generations. The central goals of this project are to (1) trace the ways the ideologies of anti-violence organizing might be embedded in the built environment through intentional urban planning; (2) how those ideologies are then experienced and internalized by inhabitants of those places; and (3) if this process works inter-generationally.  Ultimately this project seeks to understand to what extent a particular built environment informs the decision making and perceptions of individuals.  These goals will be accomplished by evaluating a urban community in Costa Rica, where domestic violence was a driving factor in the original design process, using a short term cohort study with the ""builders"" (people who participated in the design and construction of the community 20 years ago) and the ""second generation"" (people who grew up there).  The empirical data will consist of (1) life history interviewing; (2) participant photo documentation; and (3) semi-structured follow up interviews.  This innovative combination of visual and textual methods speaks to the study's conceptual landscape analysis component as well as enabling the investigators to analyze participants' understanding of domestic violence and the sustainability of anti-violence organizing across generations in relation to the built environment."

Existing literature expects that states with relatively high levels of unionization and economic development will arrive at the same policy outcome, rejecting RTW proposals. These factors do not explain divergent RTW outcomes in states with similar economies such as those of the Industrial Midwest. In both the 1950s and 2010s, highly-unionized, industrial Midwestern states like Indiana, Michigan and Ohio faced legislative and referendum proposals for RTW. Despite similar conditions, these states arrived at different policy outcomes. Indiana passed RTW in 1957 and 2012; Ohio voted against it in 1958 and 2011, and Michigan failed to introduce RTW in the 1950s, but passed it in a surprising victory in 2012. These cases challenge expectations from existing literature and pose the following question: why have Indiana, Michigan and Ohio followed divergent paths through right-to-work, despite sharing similar political and socioeconomic profiles?  That is the question this research seeks to answer.  Answering these questions will contribute to the sociology of labor and understanding organizational processes and state practices that shape policy outcomes, a topic of concern for policy practitioners, academics and the public alike. Further, the research will result in a data repository that will be a rich resource for future scholars of these topics. <br/><br/>Given that the interest groups who won Right-to-Work  (RTW) contests in Indiana, Michigan and Ohio formed strategic partnerships with state parties, this project hypothesizes that these party coalitions explain divergent RTW outcomes across the three cases. Drawing from recent work in political science, the sociology of political parties, and the sociology of knowledge and expertise, this project proposes that party coalitions shaped RTW outcomes by building broad bases of organizational support, deploying campaign language that targeted multiple, disparate constituencies, and establishing the cognitive frameworks appropriate for evaluating RTW. This project tests these hypotheses through a comparative-historical analysis of RTW battles in Indiana, Michigan, and Ohio in the 1950s and 2010s. In so doing, this dissertation promises to make three important contributions. First, it will contribute to the RTW literature by providing explanation for otherwise anomalous cases. Second, it will contribute to the sociology of parties by specifying the mechanisms through parties shape policy outcomes. Third, it will facilitate future research by preserving all original source materials in a digital repository, creating a storehouse of information from which researchers, policy practitioners and the public may learn about RTW, the labor movement, and political parties in the United States. In these ways, this dissertation promises to deepen our understanding of the organizational processes and state practices that shape policy options and outcomes in the public sphere, a topic of concern for policy practitioners, academics and the public alike."

However, despite this, an understanding of how populations around the continent will fare under climate change is poorly understood. A complicating matter is the potential effects of a commercial enterprise in the Antarctic: a fishery targeting toothfish, which are important prey for Weddell seals. Although the species is easily detected and counted during the breeding season, no reliable estimates of continent-wide Weddell seal numbers exist, due to the logistic difficulties of surveying vast regions of Antarctica. Large-scale estimates are needed to understand how seal populations are responding to the fishery and climate change, because these drivers of change operate at scales larger than any single population, and may affect seals differently in different regions of the continent. We will take advantage of the ease of detectability of darkly colored seals when they the on ice to develop estimates of abundance from satellite images.

However, despite this, an understanding of how populations around the continent will fare under climate change is poorly understood. A complicating matter is the potential effects of a commercial enterprise in the Antarctic: a fishery targeting toothfish, which are important prey for Weddell seals. Although the species is easily detected and counted during the breeding season, no reliable estimates of continent-wide Weddell seal numbers exist, due to the logistic difficulties of surveying vast regions of Antarctica. Large-scale estimates are needed to understand how seal populations are responding to the fishery and climate change, because these drivers of change operate at scales larger than any single population, and may affect seals differently in different regions of the continent. We will take advantage of the ease of detectability of darkly colored seals when they the on ice to develop estimates of abundance from satellite images.

In recent years, researchers have found that differentiated cells can be converted into stem cells by introducing a few key genetic factors into the differentiated cell. In order to harness this potential for regenerative medicine, it is important to understand the genetic factors that give stem cells their unique potential. The genetic model organism Caenorhabditis elegans has many advantages for studying this process. Importantly, the fates of all cells in the animal are known. This research focuses on two cells that arise through a single cell division and have very different potential: one is capable of making all support cells of the reproductive system, while the other is differentiated. The genetic factors that are different between these two cells will be identified and this will provide insight into what makes a stem cell different from a differentiated cell. In order to train the next generation of STEM professionals, this research will be incorporated into an advanced undergraduate laboratory that gives students a genuine research experience. Students are expected to be from diverse backgrounds, including racial and ethnic groups that are traditionally underrepresented in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Adult stem and progenitor cells are capable of producing a few related cell types. The genes and molecular mechanisms that regulate and determine this capacity are not well understood. This proposal uses progenitors of the C. elegans reproductive system as a model for defining the genetic determinants of multipotency. The somatic gonadal progenitors (SGPs) are multipotent progenitors that generate all somatic tissues of the reproductive system. Each SGP is the product of a cell division that produces one SGP and one differentiated cell, the head mesodermal cell (hmc). Therefore, in this single cell division the potential to generate all of the somatic gonadal types is differentially segregated into one daughter cell. SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes are highly conserved, large protein complexes that regulate chromatin structure and result in gene activation or repression. Molecularly distinct SWI/SNF complexes are expressed in pluripotent stem cells, multipotent progenitors, and differentiated cells, suggesting that different SWI/SNF complexes are likely to play important roles in each of these different cell states. Components of the C. elegans SWI/SNF complex are required to distinguish SGPs from their differentiated hmc sisters. The goals of this proposal are to identify the genes that distinguish multipotent SGPs from their differentiated hmc sisters, and to identify the mechanisms by which SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes regulate these cell fates. These experiments will provide insight into the genes and molecular mechanisms that distinguish multipotent progenitors from differentiated cells, and will identify the role SWI/SNF chromatin remodeling complexes in these cell fates."

Today, salmon make up the largest proportion of wild foods harvested by rural Alaskans, but the availability of this important subsistence resource is declining in many upriver areas. Research on prehistoric salmon abundance and use can provide data critical to understanding natural variation in salmon availability and how northern riverine peoples have responded to fluctuations in this important resource in the past.  By providing a long-term perspective for sustainability and food security planning, project data will benefit a variety of salmon stakeholders within Alaska and beyond. The project has a strong educational component, including the development and delivery of a project-based course for the Rural Alaska Honors Institute (a college preparatory program for rural and Alaska Native college-bound students), thus enhancing opportunities for underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This project will address three questions:  (1) How has salmon abundance varied over time in central Alaska? (2) When did prehistoric foragers begin to use salmon, and when did they begin to intensively exploit this resource? (3) How did foragers respond to changes in salmon availability? To address these questions, a multidisciplinary team will use independent approaches: (a) stable isotope analysis of human and faunal remains will reveal the contribution of salmon to the diets of prehistoric salmon consumers (e.g., humans, dogs, bears); (b) zooarchaeological and ancient DNA analyses of fish remains from existing faunal assemblages will allow reconstruction of past fish procurement and processing strategies; and (c) stable isotope analysis of interior lake sediment cores will track natural fluctuations in salmon abundance.  These data will be integrated with models of forager economy and mobility to explore cultural responses to salmon abundance through multiple prehistoric periods. This research will provide the necessary faunal isotope data to accurately reconstruct overall paleodiets of newly discovered multiple human individuals at the interior sites of Upward Sun River (~11,500 yrs old) and Tochak (~1000 yrs old), where faunal and initial isotopic data suggest significant salmon use.  This project provides unprecedented time depth on natural variation in salmon abundance in the North Pacific and in understanding how northern peoples have responded to changes in this critical resource in the past. The study will produce much-needed direct data bearing on prehistoric subsistence strategies in the Alaskan interior throughout the period of human occupation."

This research project will build on what is understood of agricultural origins by expanding knowledge of food production's implementation in marginal zones beyond sedentary villages. The project data will contribute to a broader effort to understand how ancient human groups created the conditions in which agriculture became the dominant, and eventually exclusive, economic practice across many regions of the world. By setting this particular research in this broader context of human niche construction, the place of pastoralists in the world, both contemporary and past, is reframed. Instead of overexploitation narratives (which characterize much contemporary development literature), pastoralist landscape development and management are viewed as potential innovations and adaptations to new environs which were previously unsuitable to significant population levels. To understand the relationship between food production and local climate on a global scale, pastoralists and their evolutionary landscapes require careful consideration.<br/><br/>Co-PI Abigail Buffington will examine the relationship between the anthropogenic activities of landscape management and the ecology of the broader region of Wadi Sana in the Hadramawt state of southeastern Yemen. This region is today effectively closed to new research projects due to political instability but likely was a significant conduit between regions in prehistory. Domestics from the Levant, South Asia and East Africa eventually became foundational foods in the later agricultural economies of the region. The earliest animal domesticates in Southern Arabia have been recovered from these contexts, as well as evidence of a locally, emergent pastoral economy and very early experiments in vegetation burning and water management. The climatic history of the region provided a beneficial preservation of the sediments in which dating of these discrete phases can be determined. Phytolith assemblages - the microscopic silica deposits that accumulate when plants decay - extracted from these sediments, will be used as signatures of the local plant ecology associated with these niche constructing activities. While this project aims to understand these phytolith groupings as entire entities, there is a possibility that the initial evidence of plant domesticates may be recovered in the course of this study."

As a result, important coastal archaeological sites that were once protected by ice are exposed to increased damage and even complete loss due to a combination of melting permafrost and wave erosion during the extended open water season. With this project the research team will investigate significant prehistoric and historic archaeological deposits at one such threatened site, Iita (Etah) in northwestern Greenland. Research since 2006 has documented rapid erosion of the site and revealed stratified deposits extending back 1000 years. These deposits represent two different cultural groups, the Dorset, who lived there between AD 1050 and 1200, and the Thule (ancestors of the contemporary Inuit) who moved into the area from their homeland in Alaska around 1200. The area around Iita is rich in marine and terrestrial resources, including millions of dovekies, which nest in nearby cliffs. The investigators expect to recover both artifacts and animal bones that will increase our understanding of the different ways in which these two groups used these resources.  The research team may also be able to determine whether they occupied the area at the same time, and if so, how they interacted. The nature of contact between Dorset and Thule people, if it happened, is one of the enduring questions in Arctic prehistory.  The stratified deposits at Iita provide a rare opportunity to investigate this question. The team will focus their work on areas of the site most prone to erosion, recovering data before it is lost forever. <br/><br/>A team of six researchers from Bowdoin, UC Davis, and the National Museum of Greenland will excavate at the site of Iita, Qaasuitsup Kommunia, Greenland. Due to increased ice-free periods in the stormy fall season the site is experiencing rapid erosion, documented over the course of work at this site between 2006 and 2012. Excavations in historic contexts in 2006 revealed a buried early Thule component at the site and hinted at earlier occupations. In 2012 testing by J. Darwent and H. Lange confirmed the presence of a minimum of three discrete stratigraphic levels dating to the Late Dorset period, each separated by sterile sand. These distinct occupation levels offer an unprecedented opportunity to study and compare well-defined relatively brief occupations, in contrast to the often-mixed surface and near-surface sites more commonly found. They offer the opportunity to learn about many aspects of Late Dorset Culture, from the importance of exploiting the massive dovekie colony, to their demise as the ancestors of the contemporary Inughuit moved into the area. The early Thule levels also present at the site offer the possibility of identifying the nature and extent of interaction (if any) between these two groups.  In this remote location, evaluation, monitoring, and mitigation of changes due to erosion are difficult. This fieldwork will allow the research team to both continue monitoring and to partially mitigate impending loss of these significant cultural resources."

Currently there are over five million Americans, predominantly older adults, suffering from heart failure. These patients are expected to follow complex medication regimen and self-management practices at home to stay healthy and prevent getting admitted to hospitals. A mobile application (HeartMapp) is proposed to act as a health coach by reminding patients to follow health care providers' recommendations at home. Decision making on heart failure symptoms are often confusing and challenging for patients. The HeartMapp offers automated feedback to patients based on the patients' weight, heart rate, and symptoms entered in HeartMapp. Thus, patients are alerted when symptoms are mild to take the next step and prevent worsening and readmissions. Under new regulations, if these patients are readmitted within 30-days after discharge from hospital, the hospitals are not reimbursed, as well as penalized if the readmission rates are higher than a government set limit. Reducing readmission penalty for heart failure will provide financial benefit for health care organizations by generating revenue. Therefore, hospitals are also interested in finding ways to keep patients engaged in their self-management. In order to make HeartMapp available, this project needs to better understand the complex health care ecosystem, i.e., all the players in this market, the customers and the value that HeartMapp provides to them, the users and buyers and the approval process, and the revenue streams and resources needed to make it happen.<br/><br/>HeartMapp is an easy to use non-pharmacological, non-invasive application developed with five main features as intervention options: 1) assessment of daily weight, blood pressure, and chronic heart failure (CHF) symptoms with automated feedback to enhance decision making for management of symptoms; 2) exercise including physical activity (walking) and deep breathing to improve physical health and well-being; 3) real time vital signs monitoring utilizing a wearable Bluetooth device; 4) CHF info that includes audio enabled interactive CHF education to improve knowledge; and 5) Stats, a graphical module that displays trends on patient performance. From the technical standpoint, HeartMapp is currently available in the Android platform but it needs to be updated and enhanced to include the features coming out of this I-Corps project and translated into other software platforms (iOS and Windows) to expand the customer base.  The current vision is to create a startup company or collaborate with an existing company to host the software and market the technology and license it to be included as part of existing solutions. The final report of I-Corps project will serve as a guiding document to: 1) submit a Phase I SBIR proposal in order to update the technology and test the HeartMapp for its efficacy in improving self-management of patients with CHF and thus potentially curb costly readmissions; 2) submit a Phase II SBIR proposal to take the technology to the market place; 3) Create a startup company or join an existing company interested in the commercialization of HeartMapp; and/or 4) find investors to provide the necessary funding to achieve our goals."

Being able to predict a threat that occurs seconds or minutes after an environmental cue allows for evasive or defensive action. Despite considerable progress towards understanding how memories are formed, many questions remain, such as how the brain learns about events separated in time. This project uses cutting-edge tools in neuroscience to address a previously intractable problem about how brain systems function on a second-by-second basis to link events in memory. This contribution is significant because it is expected to identify key principles of brain function that will advance our understanding of more complex forms of learning and memory. Undergraduate students, including underrepresented groups in science (women and minorities), participate in data collection, analysis, and dissemination. This project also provides an opportunity to develop educational tools to help stimulate interest in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields within the broader community. These tools include an interactive demonstration of neuronal activity and brain stimulation for annual outreach efforts to high schools in the greater Milwaukee, Wisconcin area. <br/><br/>Nearly all forms of motivated behavior require the association of events that are separated in time, but very little is known about the underlying mechanisms supporting these associations, highlighting a critical gap in the study of memory: how are sensory inputs integrated in memory when they do not overlap in time? The principal investigator recently revealed a causal link between a neural signature of working memory in the prefrontal cortex and the formation of long-term fear memory. The objective of this project is to determine how an auditory cue held in short-term working memory systems within the prefrontal cortex and hippocampus is associated with shock inputs in the amygdala to drive plasticity and adaptive fear responses. With the recent development of optogenetic tools, it is now possible to interrogate the function of discrete patterns of firing in specific neural connections. Here, the investigators leverage this tool in combination with electrophysiology in awake, behaving animals to determine when short-term mnemonic information is integrated with sensory input during memory formation. Given the importance of the prefrontal cortex and the hippocampus for the adaptive use of memory to guide behavior, a hallmark of executive function, determining how mnemonic input from these structures is integrated in downstream brain areas informs the understanding of a broad range of adaptive and maladaptive behaviors."

However, new models are evolving. For example, with 14k taxis on the streets of New York City (NYC), Uber is now is the single largest taxi service in NYC. Such companies must perform near real-time and rely on historical analytics on vehicles on road networks to keep their operations running efficiently. In particular, companies constantly compute network distances on road networks as they perform real time matchmaking between supply and demand. The technology involved in this project enables computing hundreds of thousands of network distances on road network at a very high throughput rate. <br/><br/>This project's technology is different from Google Maps, Here Maps, and other online map services in the sense that they provide APIs to compute the shortest path between a source and destination vertex. This project's technology only focuses on computing network distances at a very high throughput inside a database, which makes this technology essential for companies that perform extensive analytical queries on road networks. This approach will be attractive to food delivery companies, package delivery companies (UPS, FedEx, USPS), taxi/limousine services, and ride sharing services (Uber, Lyft, Ola Cabs). Companies that provide map services such as Google, Microsoft, or ESRI may also find this technology attractive since using it they can improve their local search service by providing network distances instead of resorting to ""as the crow flies"" distances which is currently the case.  The team's current business model would be to customize the system for each customer, requiring the purchase of licenses on a per-machine or per-site basis. This team's  plan is to concentrate on several verticals (i.e., niche markets with specific, compelling needs) and understand their requirements. The team will develop applications to cater to each of the verticals."

Yet, separate from these elements is a melodic level called word prosody. By changing pitch and emphasizing certain parts of a word, we can convey the word's meaning and even the broader significance of a phrase. In approximately 50% of the world's languages, changes in pitch on a single syllable can change a word's meaning. Such languages are called tone languages. The most commonly-spoken language in the world, Chinese, is a tone language, as are most of the languages of East and Southeast Asia, Sub-Saharan Africa, and Southern Mexico. Yet despite decades of research on the building blocks of language, consonants and vowels, we understand little of how humans perceive tone and how tone is integrated into the larger grammatical systems that we use to communicate in everyday life. For instance, Just how is tone processed in the brain? What do speakers produce and listeners tune their ears towards when producing tones rapidly in conversation? How do the deeper grammatical processes affecting tone influence such things?<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to bring together experts from diverse perspectives who focus on tone languages. While linguists have explored the diverse ways in which tone interacts with grammar and meaning, they have paid less attention to its role in cognition. On the other hand, psychologists have focused mainly on the neural and behavioral processing of tone, but have not explored tonal detail nor its interaction with grammar. Furthermore, most of the cognitive research on tone focuses on just a handful of East Asian languages. Yet, tonal systems vary substantially across the world's languages and the research should reflect this diversity. Finally, computational work on tone languages has the potential to promote cross-collaboration among researchers, but such work is still in its infancy. The 5th Symposium on the Tonal Aspects of Languages will focus specifically on integrating different academic approaches to the study of tone, promoting the study of diverse tone languages, and modeling tonal behavior using computational methods. These goals will promote greater collaboration across disciplines and drive the scientific study of tone forward."

This focus on education in cardiovascular disease (CVD) is extremely important and highly relevant for two reasons.  First, CVD remains the number one killer in the United States.  Thus, there is a great need to develop a pipeline of new engineers and scientists who can become leaders in the detection, prevention, and treatment of the disease. Second, the underlying etiology of CVD and its associated technologies combine to form a perfect platform for training in the creative and integrative thinking that is the hallmark of biomedical engineering. The objectives of this program are: 1) To conduct research on multi-scale problems to improve the understanding and treatment of CVD, 2) To apply the creative process to solve engineering problems applied to CVD treatment or intervention, 3) To be able to describe the process of translating research into marketable technology, and 4) To be able to identify requirements for success in graduate and professional schools.  <br/><br/>Over a three year period, this REU program will engage undergraduate students in a 10-week intensive hands-on summer research and professional development/training experience, where they will develop proficiency in the underlying concepts and practice of cellular/molecular engineering, microscopy, or computational methods in biomedical engineering while integrating the creative process towards understanding CVD.  The program will include individual research projects with faculty research mentors, seminars on safety training, research needs, and responsible conduct of research, workshops on the creative process applied to research, medical device development and intellectual property, outreach/dissemination of student research, and a research symposium.  Through these activities Penn State CREATE will provide young researchers with new avenues of investigation, new technologies in quantitative and analytical methods, and new opportunities in novel diagnostic and interventional tools in medicine."

High levels of earthquake hazards are generally expected at plate boundaries, such as the ""Ring of Fire"" along the Pacific Rim. However in the last five years, earthquakes in the interior of continents are rapidly increasing. Most of the increases are attributed to the development in oil/gas exploration, and the associated wastewater disposal into deep formations (i.e., other than the formations that produce oil and gas). For this reason, most of the new events are termed as ""induced earthquakes"" as they are closely related to human activities. The state of Oklahoma has been known as ""the new earthquake capital"" (more precisely, ""the earthquake capital of man-made earthquakes""), with earthquake rates of M larger than 3 exceeding those in California. On February 13, 2016, a M=5.1 earthquake occurred near Fairview, Oklahoma, being the third largest event in the history of the state. The fault that hosted this earthquake had experienced seven M4 earthquakes in the past four months. Local residents reported strong ground-shaking, gradual accumulation of energy (foreshocks), cracks in the house, and more importantly, concerns about safety. The soil in this area is mostly sand (featured with the Little Sahara State Park), which tend to make building foundations unstable, and potential hazard of liquefaction and landslides. This RAPID proposal aims at recording the seismic activity in this region to better understand its cause and ultimately its hazard potential.<br/><br/>With this proposal, we will deploy 10 broadband stations that will provide a dense azimuthal coverage to the western Oklahoma area, in particular around the Fairview and Woodward faults. These faults are separated by only about 8 km, but have distinct seismicity characteristics - the Fairview fault has predominately individual aftershock sequences from M4 events, while the Woodward fault has mostly small earthquakes with gradual seismicity rate changes, they also have different types of correlation with injection volume changes.  The data collected will help to address scientific questions such as: (1) What is the relationship between seismogenic faults mapped from seismicity and geological mapped faults from outcrops and active seismic survey? What do they reveal about the faulting processes? (2) Does injection volume variations influence the maximum size of induced earthquakes? If so, what could be suggested for the volume reduction procedures to mitigate man-made earthquake hazards? (3) Are there resolvable differences in fault mechanisms between the two major faults in this area, which would lead to significantly different seismic responses to fluid injection, e.g., velocity structures, fault strength or fault orientation relative to in-situ stress field? The results will provide important parameters that would help to assess earthquake hazards associated with ground shaking and other secondary hazards, such as liquefaction or landslides."

This project provides valuable insights to understand whether the decline in Federal R&D spending since 2010 hurts U.S. competitiveness.  This project leverages a new quantitative measure of long term technological trajectories, patent influence, to determine if public funding of inventive activity supports research that would be eschewed by the private sector.  The project investigates the long term implications of changes to federal agency support of research on the likely impact of future scientific and technological breakthroughs. The project?s research strategy presents a solution to the difficult problem of measuring the long term effects of basic research funding on invention and offers policy makers a way to better assess the types of programs that are likely to lead to long term scientific and technological breakthroughs.<br/><br/>The public contribution to the knowledge embedded in a patent is measured through the patent?s citations to patents and academic research, its funding sources, and where the invention occurred (i.e., university, a national lab or a private firm). These attributes are then related to patent influence. The use of the influence measure is computationally intensive and only recently feasible given advances in computing technology. This research is the first to provide a comprehensive, quantitative assessment of the long term influence of public support of research and development on technological trajectories, as measured by patents. A pilot study of patents granted and applied for between 2001 and 2004 suggests that while average patents are similar, some types of government funding are more likely to lead to the generation of breakthrough inventions than patents funded by the private sector. The use of quantile regression analysis accommodates the skewed nature of the returns to research and development and allows studying funding effects on breakthrough inventions. The project will calculate both influence and received influence measures for all digitized patents.<br/>"

Many of these changes were first observed and studied using data from the International Arctic Buoy Program (IABP), which maintains at least 100 buoys in the Arctic Ocean that collect data on surface water temperature, air temperature, atmospheric pressure, and ice motion. These data are analyzed and made available to the research community by the United States IABP. IABP data were fundamental in demonstrating that atmospheric pressure has decreased, air temperature has increased, and the clockwise circulation of current and ice in the Arctic Ocean has weakened in recent decades. The integrated effect of all these changes contributed to the precipitous decrease in the average age (thickness) of sea ice observed during this period. The data help us understand the recent record low summer sea ice extents. The project will continue the United States interagency Arctic buoy program which began collecting data in 1979 and provide critical atmospheric, ice, and surface ocean measurements that cannot be obtained by other means. The project also has a multifaceted outreach program to share science with the public that includes the principal investigator participating in programs such as the Polar Science Weekend, public presentations, K-12 school visits, and public communication through interactions with journalists.  <br/><br/>The observations from the IABP have been essential for: 1) monitoring Arctic and global climate change, 2) forecasting weather and sea ice conditions, 3) forcing, assimilation, and validation of global weather and climate models and, 4) validation of satellite derived estimates of sea ice motion, surface temperature, sea ice thickness, etc. Our ability to predict weather and sea ice conditions requires in situ observations of surface meteorology and ice motion. These observations are assimilated into Numerical Weather Prediction models that are used to forecast weather on synoptic time scales, e.g. by the National Weather Service; and into the many long-term atmospheric re-analyses (e.g. National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research re-analysis) that are used for innumerable climate studies. Based on a recommendation by the National Academy of Sciences in 1974, the Arctic Ocean Buoy Program was established by the Pacific Science Center/Applied Physics laboratory, University of Washington, in 1978 to support the Global Weather Experiment. The program continued through 1990 under funding from various agencies. In 1991, the IABP succeeded the Arctic Ocean Buoy Program, but the basic objective remains unchanged: maintaining a network of drifting buoys on the Arctic Ocean to provide meteorological and oceanographic data for real-time operational requirements and research purposes including support to the World Climate Research Program, the World Weather Watch Program, and the Arctic Observing Network. The project will collect data from all Arctic buoys, analyze, disseminate, and archive all IABP data, and maintain historical data bases."

The silver nanoparticles may be shed from these products resulting in exposure.  The antibacterial properties of silver have been recognized since before modern medicine; however, the specific shape and size of silver nanoparticles make them act differently than larger forms of silver. Specifically, they may cross barriers that other forms of silver cannot, following repeated exposures.

It utilizes adult neural cells as a model to test the effects of low levels of AgNPs on neural cell physiology in identified cells in vitro and in vivo. In vitro studies&#8232;will identify the intracellular signaling pathways targeted by AgNP exposure to mediate deficits&#8232;in cytoskeletal structure and function. This will be assessed by combining pharmacology with immunocytochemistry, immunoblot, and time-lapse microscopy of differentiating adult neural cells in culture. The passive and active membrane properties of living cells exposed to low-level AgNPs will be measured by patch clamp electrophysiology to quantify effects on cell physiology during differentiation.

Neurological disorders disrupt this interaction, as well as our control over our bodies. Deep brain stimulation (DBS) has emerged in the nineties as a neurosurgical intervention for the treatment of movement disorders. The principle behind DBS is to implant electrodes into deep brain structures and to inject electrical pulses to suppress pathological brain activity. The clinical personnel that perform programming of stimulation settings however, base their decisions on the observable patient responses rather than a scientific understanding of the underlying pathology, or the physiological response to stimulation. The PI's proposed effort includes studying the neural signatures of movement disorders, and the aftereffects of stimulation to provide insight into treatment options that can be tailored to the current clinical condition of the patient. Responsive DBS is expected to provide improved symptom suppression, reduce adverse effects of continuous stimulation, and prolong battery life of DBS implants. This project will also provide students in the PI's lab with an environment that promotes learning in the design of neural engineering systems, data collection in clinical settings, and analysis of large-scale datasets. All of these skills are prolific to the development of translational medicine applications for those suffering from disabilities, and to the education of the next generation of biomedical engineers.<br/><br/>The overall research goal of this project is to study the electrophysiological underpinnings of neurological disorders using next generation DBS devices capable of recording brain signals in humans, in order to responsively deliver stimulation to the current pathological state of the brain. To this end, the PI is investigating the neurophysiology of Tourette syndrome, which affects an estimated 3 to 9 school-age children in 1000, and to develop responsive DBS systems for its improved and targeted treatment in humans. Online classifieres will be built to detect involuntary tics that characterize Tourette syndrome from neural activity in the centromedian nucleus of the thalamus and the motor cortex. The input-output relationship between DBS parameters and neural activity will be studied to build inverse adaptive controllers that will yield optimal stimulation parameters. The knowledge gained from this project and the established platform can be extended to other movement disorders. The overall objective of the educational plan is to increase interest and engagement in STEM fields and to proliferate the study of engineering through a series of focused educational activities at the K-12, undergraduate, and graduate education levels.<br/><br/>The project will be co-funded by the Activation and Modulation Programs in the Neural Systems cluster of MCB and, therefore, is eligible for BioMaps co-funding."

Of interest to the principal investigator of this project is the ability of stress to impair sustained attention, the process of monitoring situations for rare and unpredictably occurring events. Adequately sustaining attention is critical for accurately performing more complex cognitive tasks.  Therefore, disruptions in sustained attention as a result of stress can lead to widespread cognitive impairments. Surprisingly, the neurobiological mechanisms that underlie the effect of stress on this type of attention are unknown. This project addresses this gap in knowledge by using behavioral, neuroanatomical, and molecular approaches to test how a specific stress-related chemical signal, corticotropin releasing factor, regulates the brain circuitry required for sustained attention in male and female rats. The results from this research will greatly advance our understanding of the interactions between the brain systems involved in stress and attention. These findings thereby may lay the groundwork for the development of strategies aimed at improving cognition during stressful events. In addition to the scientific work, this project includes an education plan designed to improve student learning outcomes for Temple University's diverse undergraduate population and create public resources for improving the teaching of college courses in the ""flipped-classroom"" format, in which students first learn new material outside of class and then use class time to work on exercises with classmates and the instructor.<br/><br/>Studies have examined how stress modulates learning, the neurobiological mechanisms by which stress modulates attention remain underexplored. Recently, the principal investigator of this project demonstrated that sustained attention is disrupted by central infusions of the stress-related neuropeptide, corticotropin releasing factor (CRF) in male and female rats. Sustained attention is known to be mediated by the basal forebrain.  Therefore, this project examines how CRF regulates the basal forebrain from the systems to the molecular levels. Aim 1 is to test the hypothesis that CRF directly modulates the basal forebrain to disrupt sustained attention by combining pharmacological manipulations and a well-validated attention task. Aim 2 is to uncover the circuitry by which CRF can impact basal forebrain neurons by using retrograde tracing, cell-type specific markers, and measures of neuronal activation. Aim 3 is to identify molecular changes induced by CRF in cholinergic basal forebrain neurons by using Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting in combination with next generation sequencing. The findings will improve our fundamental understanding of how stress affects cognition. The rich sequencing data resulting from this work is an important resource for researchers studying attention circuits, and is to be made publicly available for use by other investigators. The project's education plan is designed to improve the flipped-classroom format by developing special assignments that emphasize cognitive and metacognitive techniques to promote active engagement with the out-of-class material. These assignments are made available through public media and their efficacy is examined experimentally.  The insights gained from the educational plan are to be published in education journals."

One of the major themes of this program is the measurement of the transfer of atmospheric wave energy from the lower atmosphere into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, which overlaps the lower ionosphere. An important dynamical phenomenon associated with this wave coupling is called the quasi two-day wave (QTDW), which is a large-scale wave structure seen in the middle atmosphere winds and temperatures that is particularly pronounced within the southern hemisphere region with a spatial extent over many thousands of km. The lifetime of this structure varies between one and two weeks with a rapid growth, evolution, and decay profile that is not understood. The research of this award would utilize simultaneous data from two NASA satellites to follow the spatial progression with longitude of this structure with high temporal resolution. The 10 years extent of the database will allow this phenomenon to be intercompared from year to year and for the two periods of solar maximum and solar minimum.  This research would determine through the application of a theoretical primitive equation model what might be the predominant excitation source generating this wave structure. Two possible candidates would be investigated. One (baroclinic instability) is the development of a dynamical instability mechanism energized by the poleward edge of the stratospheric jet stream. The other (inertial instability) is an instability process energized near the geographic equator as a result of the very weak magnitude of the Coriolis force.  The broader impact of this award is the improvement of our overall understanding of fundamental MLT dynamics. A graduate student would receive half-time support.<br/><br/>The proposed activity will directly address questions regarding the coupling between atmospheric height regions, and possible energetics feedbacks between the QTDW wave phenomenology and the zonal mean circulation. The QTDW structure will be holistically investigated from the generation region into the 110 km region. Momentum and energy exchange across the stratopause and mesopause boundaries will be examined. The study will encompass a decade of observations, 2002-present, which will allow study of contrasting years, e.g., the possible influence of stratospheric warmings."

The establishment and maintenance of a stable middle class has long been regarded as essential to the health of the economy, and the viable pursuit of upward mobility is a key measure of confidence for that system. This project, which trains a graduate student in conducting rigorous, empirically grounded scientific fieldwork, asks how educated youth are able to maintain aspirations for upward mobility in the face of significant structural challenges. The findings will be useful to policymakers, planners, and practitioners interested in sustainable economic development.  <br/><br/>Robert Miles Loomis, under the supervision of Dr. Jennifer Cole at the University of Chicago, examines how members of a growing underclass of educated but irregularly employed rural graduates living on the margins of major metropolises negotiate the tension between aspirations for upward mobility and present realities of poverty and precarious employment. The research specifically such one such group in China (yi zu; or ""ant tribe""), an ideal site for exploring this question as it has seen a rapidly developing middle class since initiating its policies for ""reform and opening"" (gaige kaifang) in the late-1970s. Much of the population now sees education as only way out of poverty. Rural parents, especially, often spend all of their savings to ensure that their children attend college and land jobs in urban areas. The turn to education as a means of social mobility was itself encouraged by the government's decision in 1999 to radically expand the university system, making higher education more accessible through marketization. Yet despite the greater availability of tuition-based degrees, the Chinese economy has not generated enough white-collar jobs to absorb this massive influx of graduates. Yet members of this group, as educated youth, remain hopeful about their ability to enter into China's ""high quality"" workforce. By providing an in depth ethnographic look at this growing population, this project will explore how marginalized rural youth make sense of and act upon the terms of their social participation in contemporary urban China, and the ways they may be reproducing or challenging the nature of value and social hierarchy as they do so. Methods include participant observation and interviews at four different sites in and around Beijing."

At the same time, state transportation agencies across the nation are also relying on CIPP for repairing millions of miles of stormwater culverts. The cured-in-place-pipe repair method involves the installation of a resin impregnated fabric into the deteriorating pipeline or culvert followed by curing in situ with heat (hot water or steam) or ultraviolet light. Cured-in-place-pipe is created by the crosslinking of a polymer resin. Evidence indicates that chemical emissions from steam and hot water cured cured-in-place-pipe sewer pipe repair activities can pose a risk to human health and the environment. The project goal is to understand chemical air emissions from steam cured cured-in-place-pipe installations, one of the most popular cured-in-place-pipe technologies.<br/><br/>A December 2015 chemical emission study of three steam cured cured-in-place-pipe installation sites in a U.S. city indicated styrene was emitted into the air at greater than 1,000 ppm, exceeding all regulatory workplace exposure standards. Levels reported far exceeded the International Toxicity Estimates for Risk value of 20 ppm for the most susceptible population such as children. Styrene is one ingredient of steam cured cured-in-place-pipe, nearly 50% w/w in the uncured resin, and a volatile organic compound (VOC). Styrene, a carcinogen (NTP 2015), has an odor detection limit of 0.16 ppm. Steam cured cured-in-place-pipe is one of the most common sewer pipe and culvert repair methods in use today due to its low cost. The proposed work is urgently needed and will provide a better understanding of cured-in-place-pipe site chemical air emissions. Without this project: (1) risks posed to the environment and persons near cured-in-place-pipe installation sites will continue to be poorly defined, and, (2) cities, utilities, and state transportation agencies cannot implement engineering controls that best protect the environment or human health. This project is in response to the scientific needs of municipalities, utilities, and transportation agencies across the nation who are rehabilitating deteriorated water infrastructure, specifically pipelines and culverts. Cured-in-place-pipe is increasingly being installed throughout the U.S. for stormwater culvert and sewer pipe repair applications. New evidence suggests that cured-in-place-pipe installation activity can emit the hazardous air pollutant styrene, among other volatile organic compounds into the air exceeding workplace exposure standards and it is most common that cured-in-place-pipe emissions are poorly controlled. Currently, there is no reliable data set of time-resolved and volatile organic chemical species emissions from cured-in-place-pipe sites. In light of the growing number of emergency response incidents and population health impacts prompted by cured-in-place-pipe chemical emissions, there is an urgent need for the proposed study. Utilities, cities, and state transportation agencies do not have the information needed to develop construction specifications and engineering control strategies that limit chemical air emissions from cured-in-place-pipe sites. Results will fill a knowledge-gap that inhibits infrastructure owners and managers from better protecting the environment and nearby population from chemical air emissions. This project provides an exceptional STEM learning opportunity for Purdue University students."

Scientists know much about the short-term dynamics of displacement and resettlement. This research would give scientists a rare opportunity to understand those dynamics over the long-term. In addition, the project would strengthen collaboration among international communities of scientists, train a graduate student in methods of scientifically-grounded and empirical data collection, and contribute data that would be of benefit to public policy experts concerned with development and resettlement.  <br/><br/>Dr. Dolores Koenig of the American University will lead a team of researchers investigating the long-term dynamics of forced displacement and resettlement resulting from large infrastructural development projects.

The projects asks whether the long-term impacts of forced displacement and resettlement vary depending on the access that resettled individuals and their descendants have to economic and social resources. In collaboration with researchers from the Institut des Sciences Humains in Bamako, the research team will track household samples from two studies of migrants conducted in the 1980s, and another larger sample from a study conducted in 1993-94. Date will be gathered at four different sites with varied access to resources, to test whether livelihood and other decision-making strategies differ significantly. Data on food security, socioeconomic status, social organization and kinship, health care and education access, consumption patterns, and a range of other decision-making practices will be collected through interviews and other ethnographic data collection techniques.

Due to the potentially mutagenic nature of their transposition activity, it has been assumed that TEs are heavily suppressed, if not completely silenced, predominantly through epigenetic mechanisms, i.e., non-inheritable chemical modifications introduced into chromosomes. The researchers' analyses suggest, however, that TEs are rapidly and transiently derepressed in response to pathogen infection. Based on these findings, it is hypothesized that TEs play important roles in transcriptional reprogramming/activation in response to biotic stress and that their activity leads to phenotypic plasticity and stress adaptation. For the host plant, the proposed ability of TEs to transduce environmental challenges into epigenetic modifications that lead to stable genetic changes should confer significant evolutionary advantages. Therefore, elucidating the molecular mechanisms through which stress adaptation is mediated by epigenetic changes and clarifying their relationship to TE activation following biotic stress will be tremendously valuable for developing new traits in the plant breeding industry. The proposed research also will allow undergraduate students, as well as high school students and their teachers, to investigate solutions to a real-world problem via experimentation using high-throughput assays that will provide a robust dataset after a limited training period. The results of these analyses will be presented at local, state and national science fairs.<br/><br/>The researchers'  analysis of genome-wide chromatin accessibility suggests that the promoters and/or 5' proximal regions of many defense genes contain TEs that display heightened and dynamic chromatin accessibility in Arabidopsis after pathogen infection. These TE-associated chromatin regions exhibit infection-induced dynamic interactions with MORC1, a protein implicated in both RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) and immunity in plants. Given that i) TEs are suppressed mostly by RdDM, ii) pathogen infection induces a burst of TE expression, and iii) both TE transcription and mobility are modulated by the RdDM pathway, epigenetic factors involved in RdDM will be investigated to test the role(s) of RdDM and TEs in the induction of defense genes following pathogen infection. To this end, specific TEs and RdDM components will be silenced or knocked-out to monitor DNA methylation, chromatin accessibility and transcription levels for both targeted TEs and their proximal defense genes following infection. TEs' role in stress adaptation will also be examined by inducing biotic stress-induced TE transposition and determining if novel TE insertions confer stress-induced transcription of their proximal genes in subsequent generations. Altogether, this project seeks to significantly advance our understanding of the relationship between TEs and both immunity and stress adaptation."

As a case in point, the amount of composite materials that are used in commercial aircraft is projected to be nearly 50% by 2020. Additionally, composites are used to increase efficiency of wind turbines by producing larger blade rotors. In spite of having favorable properties such as high strength to weight ratio and moisture resistance that makes them ideal for engineering structures, composites are expensive and energy intensive to produce due to the need for large pressurized ovens (autoclaves) in their manufacturing process. Moreover, composite structures are more challenging to repair, as the repair material is often needed to be glued to the damaged structure using a high performance adhesive rather than bolting repair patches per normal practices for metallic structures. The proposed project utilizes an innovative approach that will significantly reduce the cost, and improve the energy efficiency of manufacturing and repairing large/thick composite structures. The scrap rate in the composite industry is significantly higher than other manufacturers due to the challenging nature of repairing composites. The proposed technology will help reduce the scrap rate, thereby making composite repair more efficient at a lower cost by limiting the major pain points in the current composite bonding practices.<br/><br/>The University of Washington has filed an international patent for the methodology, which protects the primary functionality that makes this innovation possible.

It will also increase our knowledge of autism in adulthood and the ways adults with autism engage with others about the nature of the diagnostic classification. <br/><br/>Heather Thomas, supervised by Dr. Keith M. Murphy of the University of California at Irvine, will investigate how adults with autism living in the United States establish and maintain social networks using various kinds of communicative practices and technologies. Research will be conducted among groups for adults with autism, autistic adults' networks on online social media websites, and national and regional autism conferences to learn about the social dynamics of online and offline social groups and networks created and sustained by adults with autism. Preliminary data suggests that these are ideal sites for examining the formation and maintenance of social groups for adults with autism, autistic adults' self-advocacy practices, and challenges to the widely held belief that autism, a neurodevelopmental disability, necessarily restricts one's interest in and capacity for social connection and meaningful community participation. Data will be collected through interviews, participation in and observation of online and offline social interactions, and collection of significant autism-related media produced in the last decade. In various social groups distributed across Southern California, the researcher will collect audiovisual data and produce descriptive notes through her participation in and observation of recurring weekly events. In exploring digital media sites frequented by autistic adults, she will document the social practices and communication technologies that members of this population use to form social networks."

However, despite this, an understanding of how populations around the continent will fare under climate change is poorly understood. A complicating matter is the potential effects of a commercial enterprise in the Antarctic: a fishery targeting toothfish, which are important prey for Weddell seals. Although the species is easily detected and counted during the breeding season, no reliable estimates of continent-wide Weddell seal numbers exist, due to the logistic difficulties of surveying vast regions of Antarctica. Large-scale estimates are needed to understand how seal populations are responding to the fishery and climate change, because these drivers of change operate at scales larger than any single population, and may affect seals differently in different regions of the continent. We will take advantage of the ease of detectability of darkly colored seals when they the on ice to develop estimates of abundance from satellite images. This project will generate baseline data on the global distribution and abundance of Weddell seals around the Antarctic and will link environmental variables to population changes to better understand how the species will fare as their sea ice habitat continues to change. These results will help disentangle the effects of climate change and fishery operations, results that are necessary for appropriate international policy regarding fishery catch limits, impacts on the environment, and the value of marine protected areas. The project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. It will engage ""arm-chair"" scientists of all ages through connections with several non-governmental organizations and the general public. Anyone with access to the internet, including people who are physically unable to participate in field research directly, can participate in this project while simultaneously learning about multiple aspects of polar ecology through the project's interactive website.  <br/><br/>Specifically, this research project will: 1) Quantify the distribution of Weddell seals around Antarctica and 2) Determine the impact of environmental variables (such as fast ice extent, ocean productivity, bathymetry) on habitat suitability and occupancy. To do this, the project will crowd-source counting of seals on high-resolution satellite images via a commercial citizen science platform. Variation in seal around the continent will then be related to habitat variables through generalized linear models. Specific variables, such as fast ice extent will be tested to determine their influence on population variability through both space and time. The project includes a rigorous plan for ensuring quality control in the dataset including ground truth data from other, localized projects concurrently funded by the National Science Foundation's Antarctic Science Program."

The broader impact/commercial potential of this project is to create sustainable, high&#8208;performance nanocomposites. Expected weight savings is between 13 and 20% per component. Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) regulations require significant increases in fuel economy for vehicles, which has led carmakers to look for innovative ways to shed vehicle weight. It has been shown that for every 10% in weight savings, vehicle fuel consumption is reduced by 7%. The target application is to replace heavy glass reinforcement in polymeric composites with CNCs for car parts, providing lighter weight vehicles with increased fuel efficiency.  On&#8208;going research into CN materials has resulted in significant reductions in cost (with more reductions expected), making CNs an increasingly attractive functional natural nanofiller, the processing of which will provide jobs in both the manufacturing and the technology sector.  Successful implementation of CNs into composites could not only lighten vehicles and reduce environmental impact, but also transform a waste stream into value-added materials, reducing the amount of waste produced by these industries.  <br/><br/>During the SBIR Phase I period, the company showed that lighter thermoplastic composites reinforced with cellulosic nanoparticles could meet the tensile strength values of glass-reinforced composites with much higher loadings, thereby saving part weight.  The Phase II grant will allow the company to scale up the manufacturing processes necessary to produce these lighter, more sustainable composites for the automotive industry. Furthermore, the company will improve performance of these materials in order to attain performance parity with higher&#8208;loaded glass&#8208;reinforced parts and potentially to compete with ultra&#8208;high performance materials such as carbon fiber composites and metals. This technology will be produced using efficient and economical manufacturing processes, allowing this to become a true drop&#8208;in technology for automotive part-makers."

Yet, this focus overlooks the fact that working in organizations is a social experience that can be rewarding and inspiring, or even frustrating and exhausting, and organizational members experience of such work climates can hinder or override rational processes. These product-focused (e.g., mechanical engineering) and person-focused (e.g., organizational psychology) approaches to organizational effectiveness tend to be studied independently, to the detriment of complete understanding productive and innovative workplaces. Each discipline has their own theoretical assumptions and research paradigms, e.g., engineering scholars focus on computational models and algorithms, and organizational psychologists obtain subjective reports and observational data. Theoretical advances require awareness and integration across these disciplines.  Methodological advances have also emerged that may permit better integration of these approaches, such as technology that records dynamic audio or video of team interactions and mapped in real time to the team processes and outcomes.  Although scholars are becoming more aware that both the people-oriented and product-oriented approaches matter to organizational effectiveness, this does not mean that they understand how these should be integrated.  Moving forward in the science of organizations requires cross-disciplinary discussions from scholars across academic silos.  As such, this workshop seeks to foster communication between leaders in the fields of engineering design, business, and organizational psychology, in order to advance the science of organizations through novel interactions between these disciplines.  <br/><br/>An interdisciplinary two-day workshop will be held at Penn State University in University Park, PA.  The goal is to advance the science of organizations - specifically modeling organizational productivity and innovation - through communication about advances in theory and research.  We will use three strategies to obtain this goal.  First, there will be papers and presentations shared from leaders in several disciplines who share a common interest in modeling the productivity and innovation of organizations and openness to multidisciplinary perspectives.  These leaders in the field include named professors and department chairs, editors of top journals, and active scholars with grant funding, from organizational psychology, business, computer science, and engineering.  Second, scholars will discuss new methodological advances for studying how organizational members work together toward shared goals, including ways to integrate the rational decision making models and the subjective multilevel and dynamic human experience.  Finally, there will be informal breakout sessions to encourage cross-disciplinary conversations about the presentations, and permit collaborative opportunities to emerge.  Junior scholars and graduate students with related interests will be invited to attend to advance the next wave of organizational scholarship.  This workshop will provide unique opportunities to build novel theories and research approaches that more truly and comprehensively capture the complexity of productive and innovative processes in today's workplace."

This project provides valuable insights to understand whether the decline in Federal R&D spending since 2010 hurts U.S. competitiveness.  This project leverages a new quantitative measure of long term technological trajectories, patent influence, to determine if public funding of inventive activity supports research that would be eschewed by the private sector.  The project investigates the long term implications of changes to federal agency support of research on the likely impact of future scientific and technological breakthroughs. The project?s research strategy presents a solution to the difficult problem of measuring the long term effects of basic research funding on invention and offers policy makers a way to better assess the types of programs that are likely to lead to long term scientific and technological breakthroughs.<br/><br/>The public contribution to the knowledge embedded in a patent is measured through the patent?s citations to patents and academic research, its funding sources, and where the invention occurred (i.e., university, a national lab or a private firm). These attributes are then related to patent influence. The use of the influence measure is computationally intensive and only recently feasible given advances in computing technology. This research is the first to provide a comprehensive, quantitative assessment of the long term influence of public support of research and development on technological trajectories, as measured by patents. A pilot study of patents granted and applied for between 2001 and 2004 suggests that while average patents are similar, some types of government funding are more likely to lead to the generation of breakthrough inventions than patents funded by the private sector. The use of quantile regression analysis accommodates the skewed nature of the returns to research and development and allows studying funding effects on breakthrough inventions. The project will calculate both influence and received influence measures for all digitized patents.<br/>"

Using an intervention into the existing - largely disconnected - scientific community, female faculty will participate in networking workshops, as well as pre- and post-intervention surveys to understand their current networking needs, improvement of their networking abilities over time, and the impact their network ties have on academic collaboration.  The goal of the intervention process is to lower isolation of female faculty in geotechnical engineering by creating and sustaining a supportive national network that drives career success in academia.<br/><br/>This project will apply social network analysis and professional development activities to improve networking and collaboration among geotechnical engineering faculty in order to bridge the geographical distance and connectivity gaps faced especially by female geotechnical engineering faculty.  Building on past efforts of NSF and others, the project will create a network that fosters active tie creation and provides access to collaboration opportunities among geotechnical engineering faculty in the U.S.  The intervention into the existing network combines face-to-face networking meetings and virtual networking practices to increase collaboration opportunities.  The core challenges are: (a) how to sustain the attention network, (b) how to maintain strong connections among female faculty in their immediate professional environments and, (c) how to create weak ties that will help them in situations where their strong ties are unable to provide the social support, collaboration and information that they need.  The outcomes of the research will improve the faculty's understanding of the importance of networking, provide opportunities for sustaining collaborative connections with colleagues across the nation, and equip participants with the knowledge and skills to collaborate in a networked world.  The summative evaluation, including a before and after social network analysis, will evaluate the effectiveness of the purposeful interventions into the existing network of mostly weak ties among geotechnical women faculty and recommend promising practices for use in other disciplines where women face similar challenges."

This is a challenge because of the complex network of connections among the living organisms and the non-living parts of ecosystems.  Mathematical models are essential tools to keep track of these ecological interactions and to predict how they will respond to environmental changes. However, models need to be linked to data from nature. Two major challenges in developing predictive models of environmental change are 1) collecting sufficient data on how interactions among a complete set of species and environmental factors change over time, and (2) rigorously testing model predictions with experiments. This study will combine a quarter-century long series of data on 100+ species and relevant environmental variables in the rocky shoreline of Tatoosh Island in Washington state, with a long-term field experiment that mimics the extinction of a key species, the California mussel. The long term data will be applied to several different modeling approaches and predictions from these models will subsequently be tested with the long-term field experiment. The research will identify the most promising modeling approaches for making ecological prediction, and make them available to ecosystem managers and policy makers interested in the consequences of environmental impacts such as species extinction and global change. The comprehensive data series also will be made available to other scientists to be used as a platform for additional studies.  This project will also engage undergraduate students in field research, data management, mathematical modeling, and in communicating with the public, managers, and policy makers. Furthermore, because the challenge of understanding networks of species interactions is shared with other scientific disciplines that deal with complex networks, project results will be of general value in other disciplines. <br/><br/>The researcher will conduct annual surveys of replicated permanent plots for plants and animals on the shoreline in two ways: 1) by documenting the species identities under 2,600 fixed points over a 5-year period and generating annual transition probabilities among species, and 2) by generating abundance estimates in permanent 60 x 60 cm census plots.  Fifteen experimental plots will be maintained by selectively removing individuals of Mytilus californianus when they appear, leaving all other species undisturbed.  Environmental data will be collected every 30 minutes using a submersible data logger and a land-based weather station. Water chemistry, including critical nutrients, will be monitored.  These data will be analyzed in several ways, including 1) parameterizing transition-based models (Markov chain models, spatially-explicit cellular automata) with environmental dependencies, 2) parameterizing multi-species population dynamic models from plot counts, 3) applying multi-spatial cross-convergent mapping and testing whether it accurately detects key species known to have strong causal effects from independent experiments, 4) applying neural network models and testing their predictions about the consequences of species extinction, and 5) testing whether there is a relationship between the variability of a species' abundance through time and its importance to the ecosystem as assessed by independent experiments. The community modeling projects enabled by the rich long term data sets have a strong potential to advance our understanding of mechanisms underlying community dynamics and their response to environmental change."

However, when disposed of improperly, it can also find its way into ground and surface waters. While this usually happens in trace quantities, at higher concentrations it may cause adverse health effects.  It cycles between two oxidation states and is toxic in the hexavalent form. This project involves a theoretically sound, but high-risk, untested approach with significant potential impact, to develop a new method of detection of chromium in water. This project will create a new rotating ring-disk electrodes-based tool with the potential to transform the environmental engineering community's understanding of chemical processes that relate to water quality, public health, and regulatory processes.<br/><br/>This EAGER project will develop a novel in situ electrochemical tool for the detection of chromium intermediate species during the oxidation of trivalent chromium Cr(III) species in drinking water. Formation of highly toxic hexavalent chromium Cr(VI, typically in the form of oxyanion CrO4 2-,  can inadvertently take place in drinking water due to the oxidation of residual Cr(III) by disinfectants. However, the mechanisms of Cr(III) oxidation remain largely unexplored. Preliminary investigations in the principal investigator's (PI's) laboratory indicates that the yield of Cr(VI) is controlled by elemental reactions involving the formation of Cr intermediate species, followed by the associated decomposition of these intermediate species. This project aims to develop a novel electrochemical system with multi-stage rotating ring-disk electrodes to quantitatively investigate the formation of short-lived tetravalent and pentavalent chromium species, i.e., Cr(IV) and Cr(V). Currently, the detailed mechanisms of Cr(VI) formation via Cr(III) oxidation are poorly understood. Although it is widely presumed that the low solubility of Cr(III) prevents its release in drinking water and that Cr(III) is chemically inert downstream of water treatment processes, these presumptions are inadequate. Since Cr(VI) is under consideration by regulatory agencies for more stringent drinking water standards, it is urgent to understand the fundamental mechanisms of Cr(VI) formation to develop better control strategies. This research will assess the role of these intermediate species relevant to Cr(VI) occurrence in drinking water. Specifically, in this project, two novel and advanced electrode systems will be developed to examine the nature of Cr intermediate species: (1) state-of-the-art noble metal electrodes (i.e., gold and platinum) for homogeneous Cr(III) oxidation investigation; and, (2) in-house built electrode with deposited Cr(III) minerals for heterogeneous Cr(III) oxidation investigation. Outcomes of this research will establish a protocol for rotating ring-disk electrodes-based electrochemical analysis of chromium intermediates and exploration of fundamental mechanisms associated with Cr(VI) formation.  Outcomes of this research will establish a protocol for rotating ring-disk electrodes-based electrochemical analysis of chromium intermediates and exploration of fundamental mechanisms associated with Cr(VI) formation in aquatic systems.

These reinforcement-learning mechanisms have well-known neural correlates, and theories of such learning provide excellent accounts for human behavior in limited contexts. However, trial-and-error learning has typically been studied in laboratory tasks in which value-associated features are known and are the only stimulus aspects presented to subjects. Thus, theories of how this type of learning is accomplished in the real world face a key problem: there are a multitude of potentially relevant aspects of experience that co-occur with any given decision or outcome, so which associations should be learned and guide future behavior? This project explores how humans cope with a multidimensional world when making experience-guided decisions. A better understanding of human decision-making behavior will facilitate more complete theories of learning, enable us to better predict and enhance real-world decision-making, and improve understanding of how such decision-making might break down due to mental disorders. This project will provide research opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, and include broad public outreach in the form of online demonstrations and explanations of models of learning and decision-making. Further, the proposed activity includes a yearly workshop on MRI methods, which will provide training opportunities in new methods and outreach to students and faculty across fields.<br/><br/>The proposed project will use computational modeling of behavior and model-based fMRI to assess how humans learn about relevant and irrelevant features of the world during reward-guided decision-making. The first study will address whether irrelevant stimulus dimensions are tracked with respect to value, both in terms of choice behavior and in terms of neural representations of value. Specifically, the project will ask whether reward prediction error signals in ventral striatum and elsewhere in the brain are explained solely by relevant feature-value associations, or whether irrelevant feature-value associations are also tracked neurally and influence behavior. The second study will examine whether learned statistical contingencies in one domain, visual perception, arbitrarily influence value learning both in terms of behavior and brain activity. Findings from this study will illuminate how distinct associative learning mechanisms interact to guide behavior. Finally, a third study will examine the role of context in reward-guided decision-making, examining how well contextual features can be incorporated into decision-making. The results of this work will guide development of human reinforcement learning theories towards accommodating the complexity of real-world decision-making environments. This project will illuminate the degree to which control over which particular associations guide behavior is exerted during learning or at the time of choice."

Functional connectivity, or correlations in patterns of brain activation (measured via fMRI), is thought to reflect this inter-regional communication. But communication between brain regions ultimately depends on structural connectivity: the white matter tracts that, either directly or indirectly, connect them. This proposal is aimed at resolving two open questions: 1) What are the dynamic relationships between structural and functional connectivity, for the key networks known to be involved in reasoning and other higher cognitive processes, as these develop together across childhood?, and 2) How do these dynamic relationships affect developmental improvements in reasoning ability?  The answers that we obtain will provide both fundamental insight into the development of brain connectivity and mechanistic insight into the development of reasoning ability.  This knowledge could impact future research both on educational and training programs designed to teach reasoning ability, and on interventions or medical programs designed to correct problems in reasoning. <br/><br/>To address these questions, we will combine fMRI, DTI, and behavioral data from three longitudinal developmental datasets, collected at UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and Vanderbilt University. By combining datasets, we are able to examine longitudinal data from 400 children and young adults between the ages of 6 and 22. Our primary measures of interest include a) intrinsic functional connectivity between specific regions of interest; b) structural connectivity, measured via fractional anisotropy along tracts that connect these regions; and c) reasoning ability, measured via standard cognitive tests. Our main analyses will focus on connectivity within and between two brain networks, the fronto-parietal network and cingulo-opercular network, which are most closely associated with reasoning and other higher cognitive functions. Mixed-model regression analyses will be employed to examine concurrent relationships among structural and functional connectivity in these networks and reasoning ability. Multivariate latent difference score models will be employed to examine lead-lag relationships. The outcome of this research will be a model of interacting structural and functional connectivity development across childhood, and of how the co-development of these two indicators of neural communication relates to developmental improvements in reasoning ability."

However, earthquakes also provide valuable information on Earth?s structure and tectonics. In this project, we will be using information from earthquakes to learn about the structure and tectonics of the Zagros mountains in Iran. The Zagros are a classic example of a young continental ?collision zone?, caused by the Arabian plate crashing into Eurasia, and are also amongst the most seismically-active regions anywhere in the world. However, its many earthquakes are buried under a thick blanket of sediments and so the fault-lines that generate them cannot be identified using conventional field mapping. Instead, we will use cutting-edge seismological techniques to locate very precisely the past half century of earthquake activity, in doing so highlighting the locations of buried faulting at depth. The Zagros can be used as a modern analog to parts of the Rocky Mountains and Appalachians which formed tens to hundreds of millions of years ago and which are no longer seismically active. An improved understanding of the Zagros will therefore help us understand the structure and tectonic history of parts of the United States. <br/><br/>The Zagros range in Iran is a type example of how thick sedimentary basins are shortened during the early stages of continental collision. However, its present-day kinematics are obscured by uncertainties in the locations of steep, seismogenic reverse faults buried within or beneath the 8-16 km-thick sedimentary cover, and by conflicting interpretations of their role in controlling the growth of ""whaleback"" anticlines which dominate its physiography. The prevalent seismotectonic model for the Zagros has earthquakes concentrated along a small number of large, basement reverse faults which account for discrete steps in the exposed stratigraphic level, with shortening of cover rocks away from the master thrusts accommodated by detachment folding along weak salt layers. An alternative model holds that earthquake faulting is widely-distributed through the Zagros, correlating with individual anticlines through fault bend and fault propagation folding. We propose a simple test of these conflicting models that will integrate two state-of-the-art earthquake relocation procedures to yield improved epicenters for the entire, ~50 year back-catalog of several thousand teleseismically-recorded events in the Zagros. The first step repositions discrete clusters of earthquakes with respect to well-located ?calibration? events whose hypocenters are known independently from InSAR observations and modeling or from temporary local seismometer deployments. The second step uses results from the first as prior constraints in a Bayesian relocation algorithm that is better suited to larger data sets spread over wider regions, and which has well-characterized uncertainties and minimal location bias. Epicentral uncertainties will drop from a few tens of kilometers (for routine catalog estimates) to no more than a few kilometers. The existence and importance of major basement faults will be confirmed if the relocated epicenters aggregate into streaks of seismicity aligned with the known steps in stratigraphic level, whereas the opposing model will be supported if earthquakes mostly lie away from the proposed basement faults."

In some places, chieftaincies, clans, sultanates, or kingdoms perform many of the functions of a state: enforcing legal codes, collecting taxes, guaranteeing property rights, and ensuring security. The leaders of some such institutions demonstrate an impressive command over their followers. Yet in other places, residents feel free to disobey their leaders with impunity. The PI examines why leaders of some non-state institutions are able to command compliance from their followers while others are not. To address this question, the project employs both ethnographic techniques and a survey experiment in peripheral regions of Chad, which ranked sixth on the 2014 Fragile States Index. This project contributes to understanding about the mechanisms that relate to governance, order, legitimacy, and compliance in poor and developing countries. Understanding these mechanisms is particularly important to policy makers who are interested in governmental stability and accountability. <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>The project will conduct survey experiments to test for differences in degree to which legacy institution leaders can induce compliance among their followers. The key randomized manipulation will be whether a directive has the backing of a legacy institution leader. The PI will test two outcomes. Contributions made in a version of the ""dictator game"" is the first outcome that is measured. The respondent decides whether and how much to contribute to an apolitical development project for the region. The randomized treatment is an endorsement from a legacy institution leader. Whether participants return to a development-related information session is the second outcome measured. The PI hypothesizes that ""treated"" respondents--those who hear an endorsement from a legacy institution leader--will be more likely to contribute to the project and to attend the meeting. The PI uses Chad as the country of interest. This project contributes to understanding about the mechanisms that relate to governance, order, and compliance in poor and developing countries."

One of the major themes of this program is the measurement of the transfer of atmospheric wave activity from the lower atmosphere into the mesosphere and lower thermosphere, which overlaps the lower ionosphere. An important dynamical phenomenon associated with this wave coupling is called the quasi two-day wave (QTDW), which is a large-scale wave structure seen in the middle atmosphere winds and temperatures that is particularly pronounced within the southern hemisphere region with a spatial extent over many thousands of km. The lifetime of this structure varies between one and two weeks with a rapid growth, evolution, and decay profile that is not understood. The research of this award would utilize simultaneous data from two NASA satellites to follow the spatial progression of this structure with high temporal resolution. The 10 years extent of the database will allow this phenomenon to be intercompared from year to year and for the two periods of solar maximum and solar minimum.  This research would determine through the application of a theoretical primitive equation model what might be the predominant excitation source generating this wave structure. Two possible candidates would be investigated. One (baroclinic instability) is the development of a dynamical instability mechanism energized by the poleward edge of the stratospheric jet stream. The other (inertial instability) is an instability process energized near the geographic equator as a result of the very weak magnitude of the Coriolis force.  The broader impact of this award is the improvement of our overall understanding of fundamental MLT dynamics. A graduate student would receive half-time support.<br/><br/>The proposed activity will directly address questions regarding the coupling between atmospheric height regions, and possible energetics feedbacks between the QTDW wave phenomenology and the zonal mean circulation. The QTDW structure will be holistically investigated from the generation region into the 110 km region. Momentum and energy exchange across the stratopause and mesopause boundaries will be examined. The study will encompass a decade of observations, 2002-present, which will allow study of contrasting years, e.g., the possible influence of stratospheric warmings."

There is yet insufficient capability to predict the observed complex transport behaviors of these particles under environmental conditions.  Consequently, the theory to support optimized design of the above environmental systems is lacking.  Mathematical models currently can describe but not predict these behaviors because, as yet, the models do not represent the underlying mechanisms and processes for particle attachment to surfaces under environmental conditions.  The proposed research aims to determine whether observed complex colloid transport behaviors will emerge from pore-scale representation of the surface heterogeneity responsible for particle attachment.  The proposed investigations involve parallel experiments and simulations at pore (micromodel) and network (packed sand column) scales.  The research will provide for a transformative platform for researchers and practitioners to perform mechanistic prediction of particle transport for design of solutions to environmental problems.  Additional broader impacts include engagement of middle and high school biology, chemistry, and earth science teachers in six-week long summer internships where they undertake field and laboratory experiences examining the role of particles in trace element transport and transformation.<br/><br/>The capability to predict the observed complex transport behaviors of colloids under environmental conditions (e.g., non log-linear profiles of retained colloids, extended tailing of low concentrations, blocking, and ripening) is currently lacking.  Empirically based continuum-scale rate constants and scaling factors are employed in the advection-dispersion equation to describe, and to a limited extent predict, the observed complex transport behaviors.  Whereas these descriptions are extremely useful indicators of mechanisms, true predictive capability will be possible only if the underlying physicochemical mechanisms/processes are identified and parameterized at a more fundamental level.  Pore scale (nanoscale) colloid-surface interactions are well-demonstrated to exert profound influences on colloid transport behaviors at the continuum scale (column and field).  This research aims to determine whether the continuum-scale rate constants and scaling factors can be predicted, and the whether the observed complex continuum-scale behavior will emerge, from pore-scale representation of surface heterogeneity and network-scale representation of packing structure.  This investigation involves parallel experiments and simulations at pore (micromodel) and continuum (column) scales.  Coupled pore scale force/torque balance simulations will be conducted to pore/grain network simulations in order to develop mechanistic prediction of continuum scale rate constants and scaling factors.  New approaches will be used to represent surface heterogeneity responsible for colloid attachment to bulk repulsive surfaces at the pore scale.  The proposed research will also capitalize on, and extend, recent understanding of influences of topology at the continuum (network) scale where the transition between molecular (diffusion-driven) and particle (trajectory-driven) transport behaviors will be explored."

However, the behavior of liquids remains poorly understood between these two extremes, impeding the development of technologies such as molecular sensors, and limiting scientific understanding of the function of biological molecules. The main reason for this gap in knowledge has been the lack of experimental methods to probe the short length scales and fast time scales involved.  The principal investigator has recently developed a novel method to access this regime directly, using short laser pulses to monitor the vibrations of nanometer-scale metal particles floating in the liquids.  This project applies this experimental method, together with rigorous theoretical models, to develop a fundamental understanding of the unusual and complex properties of ordinary liquids at nanometer length scales and picosecond time scales.  The research is integrated with educational activities that have the overall objective of improving the recruitment, retention, and success of underrepresented minorities and transfer students in the physical sciences.  This involves three interconnected activities: (1) outreach to incoming minority and transfer physics students; (2) involvement of undergraduate students in the research project; and (3) a rebuilding of the Modern Physics Laboratory course to involve modern educational approaches and contemporary physics topics.<br/><br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to provide a quantitative understanding of the non-Newtonian effects that arise in conventional liquids, such as water, when they interact with a rapidly moving solid nanostructure. Simplifying assumptions that are used for fluid-dynamics problems at larger scales break down at the nanometer scale.  In particular, the common assumption that conventional liquids have a purely viscous response no longer holds, because the characteristic times for the motion of nanoscale objects are comparable to molecular relaxation times in the liquids. This project investigates this complex response experimentally using a method, recently developed by the principal investigator, based on ultrafast laser spectroscopy of vibrating metal nanoparticles suspended in the liquids.  Measurements of the gigahertz-scale mechanical vibrations of metal nanoparticles in viscous liquids are used to obtain a quantitative, phenomenological description of the linear, shear viscoelastic response of conventional liquids.  Extensions of the experiments access more complex aspects of the viscoelastic response, including compressibility, terahertz-frequency response, and nonlinear viscoelasticity.  The experimental results are compared to molecular-dynamics simulations in order to explain how the continuum viscoelastic response emerges from microscopic interactions. By providing a link between microscopic, molecular-level descriptions and bulk, fluid-dynamical descriptions of liquid properties, the project addresses the grand challenge of understanding how continuum behavior in liquids emerges from microscopic interactions among the molecules that make up the liquid."

As such, more Americans who grew up speaking only English are interested in acquiring Spanish as a second language. Nonetheless, mistakes in grammar and mispronunciation can often lead to unsuccessful communication. While second language instruction tends to focus on the acquisition of vocabulary, syntax and the sounds of the target language, little attention is paid to intonation, or the melody of speech. Importantly, non-native intonation has been shown to cause misunderstandings in terms of the intentions a speaker is trying to convey. Intonation conveys a wide array of meanings, including (but by no means limited to) sentence-type, surprise, focus and politeness. Non-native speakers tend to transfer the melodies associated with specific meanings in their native tongue to their second language, but the relationship between intonation and its many meanings differs from language to language. Therefore, non-native speakers often unintentionally communicate the wrong meaning in their second language. For example, it has been shown that native speakers of Spanish sound rude to English speakers since they use less exaggerated pitch movements, while English speakers may sound over-excited to Spanish-speaking listeners. Therefore, there is a great need for instructors to focus on intonation in the classroom. More research is needed to understand what specific types of issues learners might face when learning the intonation patterns of a second language, and the meanings associated with them. <br/><br/>The present study focuses on how intonation is used to signal information status, that is, whether information in a conversation is new or old to the listener. For instance, if A asks B ""Who ate the cake? "", B can respond, ""Mary ate the cake"". The intonation used on the word ""Mary"" in this context could differ when compared to a context where A says to B, ""Sarah ate the cake"", while B knows that it was actually Mary that ate the cake. Here B could use corrective intonation to indicate that A was wrong: ""MARY ate the cake"". At the same time, reduced intonational prominence might be given to the words ate the cake in the second scenario since the fact that someone ate the cake was already activated in the conversation. This shows that speakers are aware of whether information in conversation is new or old, and modify their intonation patterns based on these differences. However, Spanish and English differ in their intonational strategies for doing so. This research aims to understand how learners who have not received formal instruction on the uses of intonation become aware of intonational differences throughout the learning process. Ms. Sanchez will carry out both production and perception experiments designed to understand how U.S. college students are able to produce and comprehend Spanish intonational strategies for conveying information status. While the work is of theoretical importance, there are practical and pedagogical implications that should allow for non-native speakers to better convey their intentions and understand the intentions of others."

They also tie together former strangers and do so in ways that significantly affect the recovery process for both individuals and communities. The goal of the research is to understand how different networked groups develop, how they change over time, and how those changes affect and are affected by their reaction to the events and their aftermath. Because this is a dynamic process that begins right after an event takes place and unfolds over years, Jones and Murphy have taken a  longitudinal approach: a sustained, focused, long-term investigation of how social groups emerge, coalesce, and divide, as well as how they affect and are affected by their contexts and memberships, during the recovery process.

The network data will be analyzed with formal network modeling measures of embeddedness and bridging. The interview data will be coded for analysis with text analysis software. Preliminary findings suggest that while participation in a network of people who shared and understood their experience sometimes afforded a support advantage, this was not always true. Jones and Murphy will explore the sources of disagreement and conflict, how these affect recovery, and what produces exceptions where these conflicts and individual problems like guilt, depression, fear and helplessness are overcome. This project builds new links between the fields of community psychology and anthropology in disaster and trauma studies. It also brings insights on impact and recovery to a broader audience of political scientists interested in extreme events and governance, geographers who study hazards and vulnerability, and sociologists  concentrating on disasters and social organization. Better knowledge of social aspects of coping in mass trauma events is important for counselors, as well as public officials and policy makers who must help those who struggle to find meaning and justice post-trauma."

The use of red and yellow ochre pigments for symbolic purposes is among the most widespread and persistent of human cultural behaviors. However, the study of archaeological ochre has been hindered by ambiguity over how to interpret this iron-based pigment in the absence of obvious symbolic applications such as cave or rock art. This project combines archaeological, geological, and ethnographic methods to investigate prehistoric through modern use of ochre pigments. The investigators have already conducted interviews with the Maasai and Samburu peoples of Kenya, many of whom still use ochre in their daily lives, and identified outcrops of ochre minerals that these groups exploit for symbolic and functional purposes. Geochemical techniques proven to be effective at telling apart ochre from different sources will be used to analyze samples collected from ochre deposits, and to match them to paint samples from rock art sites and ochre artifacts from archaeological sites in the region. This project will refine minimally destructive methods that can be used to analyze the composition of ochre and other iron-containing materials for anthropological, geological, materials science, and forensic applications. Improving techniques for determining the geographic and geologic origin of ochre pigments and related materials has significant implications for identifying looted heritage items and forgeries. The project will also provide opportunities for public science education via museum outreach, international collaborations, and mentoring in the STEM sciences for underrepresented minority students. <br/><br/>Recent discoveries of ochre pigments from Stone Age archaeological sites have shed light on the great temporal depth of human symbolic behavior. Our understanding of the evolutionary significance and potentially the meaning of ancient symbolism using pigments has been enhanced by novel geochemical techniques for provenance studies of ochre, particularly minimally destructive trace element fingerprinting by Inductively Coupled Plasma - Mass Spectrometry. The project builds on improvements in this method over the last decade by creating a database of trace element and stable isotope (strontium, lead, and iron) fingerprints for ochre sources currently or recently used by inhabitants of the Kenya Rift Valley. The Maasai and Samburu are among the few remaining peoples in East Africa with active rock art and ochre self-adornment traditions. They present the best opportunity for studying how modern humans interact with their geologic environment for symbolic purposes. Once completed, the source database will be used to determine the geologic provenance of ochre artifacts and rock art paints of Stone Age through recent origin that were sampled during field and museum research. This will allow for investigation of hypotheses about symbolically mediated versus least-cost (nearest source) models of mineral deposit exploitation, transport and trade of ochre pigments, and preferential use of specific pigment colors. In addition, the source fingerprint database will be made freely available online for other scientists to use in their own research upon completion of the project."

However, the lack of access to test facilities for technology development and implementation is a major impediment for this transformation. This workshop will focus on evaluation metrics for technologies and the structure and general functions for a potential test bed network.<br/><br/>Recent workshops on energy-positive water resource recovery, organized collaboratively by federal agencies, academic institutions, industry groups, and water utilities, paved a pathway toward the water resource recovery facilities of the future. The energy content (heat and chemical) embedded in wastewater is multiple times the energy used for treatment, and value-added resources such as nutrients, precious metals, chemicals, and clean water can be recovered as well at such facilities.  The most pressing the finding of these recent workshops and activities was the hindrance of new technology adoption due to the lack of test-bed facilities for wastewater technologies. The objective of this workshop focuses on envisioning the structure of a test bed network and specific action plans to assist with technology transfer from laboratory benchtops all the way through demonstration and deployment. The participants from different fields will discuss the following major questions: 1) What will the testbeds look like? 2) How can a testbed network be built? 3) How will different projects will enter the testing pipeline? 4) How can environmental compliance be assured? 5) How can successful demonstrations be translated to the market place? 6) What are the economic, social, and environmental impacts of the projects and testbed network? EPWRRFs are an excellent way to address ""tipping points"" in the food-water-energy nexus by lowering energy usage at water treatment plants, by recovering valuable resources required by agriculture and other industries, and by providing clean water for both potable and non-potable uses.  Enabling these new technologies to transfer to the marketplace is key to solving water quality issues as well as food and energy sustainability problems."

The research will develop novel tools and methods that overcome present analytical barriers. The principal investigator (PI) will develop new technologies to address future problems related to the environment or other challenges relevant to society. This proposal has clear broad impacts on society and well-being via addressing the environmental health risk of air pollution.<br/><br/>The primary objective of this proposal is to demonstrate the efficacy of ""switchable"" polarity materials for the collection and/or chromatographic separation of the most elusive components of the atmosphere that have high polarity and hydrophilicity due to their highly oxidized state. The PI will explore and evaluate methods that use switchable surfaces to alter the polarity of sample collection media and/or sample analysis with changes in the stationary phase of gas or liquid chromatography systems. The polarity of switchable materials is increased via reversible reactions with added carbon dioxide (CO2). Subsequent purging with an inert gas or solvent removes the CO2 and returns the material to its low-polarity precursor. This provides a novel and potentially transformative way to selectively collect/separate polar chemical species that are thermally-degraded or lost in other analytical instrumentation. The techniques proposed would seed a new generation of chromatography methods (with Liquid and Gas Chromatography) where the polarity of the stationary phase can be changed rather than the mobile phase, opening new avenues of analysis and potentially reducing solvent needs. There are many applications to gas- and aerosol-phase compounds relevant to the atmosphere, but also to other laboratory methods where polar analytes require collection/separation from a fluid or chromatographic separation without solvents. This includes novel air sampling inlets of minimal size with coupled collection and separation of polar compounds on the same device. There is also the potential for sampling systems that are directly applicable to the study of water-soluble compounds and their aqueous chemistry in the atmosphere. The results of these methods will seed a new understanding of atmospheric oxidation chemistry that will improve models and enable comprehensive air quality management plans. The anticipated results will aid in sustainability science by providing new usable knowledge to model future air quality, formulate policy, and inform the public. The proposal also contributes to training and career development for a postdoctoral scholar. The results will be quickly disseminated to the public via a potential high-impact journal publication and publically available papers and information on the group website."

In response to the Ebola virus epidemic, both the World Health Organization and the United States Centers for Disease Control advised direct disposal of Ebola-contaminated liquid waste into sewage systems (wastewater collection and treatment systems) and latrines without disinfection. In the wake of this recommendation, several questions were raised regarding appropriate handling of Ebola virus contaminated liquid waste, including the environmental persistence of Ebola virus, efficacy of disinfection approaches against Ebola virus, and risks posed by Ebola virus within wastewater infrastructure. In light of the uncertainty and research following this outbreak, the principal investigator (PI) proposes a workshop to summarize the state of knowledge on Ebola fate in human waste and the environment. This topic will be extended to other emerging deadly pathogens. The goal of this workshop is to summarize current research findings, compare results utilizing Ebola virus surrogates and the Ebola virus, and move towards a consensus on recommendations for outbreak response and research needs. The workshop is proposed to be 1.5 days (tentatively February 18-19) in the Washington, D.C. region.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed workshop will advance understanding in the handling of Ebola contaminated wastewater by sharing cutting edge research. It will also inform wastewater handling in outbreak response. The proposers are well-qualified to conduct the proposed workshop as each have active funded projects in environmental viral persistence and quantification, including Ebola virus persistence. The workshop is coordinated with Homeland Security investigators who are involved in Ebola studies, and the results of the  studies conducted by the investigators will be compared. The proposed project will promote teaching, training, and learning for workshop participants. It is the goal of the workshop planners to invite a small group of postdoctoral scholars and graduate students to enhance participation and training. The proposed workshop will broaden participation and integrate diversity through targeting gender balance in workshop participants and discussion leaders. The results from this project will be disseminated in the peer-reviewed literature and a final workshop report. Ultimately, this workshop will lead to improved public health through better-informed wastewater handling in outbreak response."

These flows are mostly confined to the horizontal plane and are not very efficient at mixing the warm, lighter water near the surface with the colder, denser waters below. At smaller scales of a kilometer or so, the so-called submesoscale, this balance begins to break down and vertical motions become more energetic. Bulk of the existing literature on submesoscale physics has concentrated on fronts within deep, order 100 meter wintertime mixed layers. In this study, high-resolution large-eddy simulations will be used for a systematic study of sharp fronts in shallow, order 10 meter mixed layers and the instabilities capable of extracting the available potential energy from such fronts. These fronts are often found in subtropical latitudes. These high-resolution simulations will complement our existing knowledge of frontal instabilities in deep wintertime mixed layers. The simulations will also document the effects of surface waves on the onset of instabilities. Fronts are vital to the dissipation of the large-scale oceanic kinetic energy through small-scale turbulence. An improved understanding of frontal instabilities in shallow mixed layers, the theme of this project, contributes directly to our knowledge of the large-scale circulation. Frontal mechanisms also promote the supply of nutrients from deeper layers where they are abundant to the surface layers where they are consumed by planktonic plants. The project will also enable continued outreach efforts to convey the scope of this research to general audiences at the Ocean Explorium events in New Bedford, MA and to high school students through the Massachusetts Marine Educators Association.<br/><br/>Shallow, salinity-controlled fronts are often generated in subtropical latitudes by local precipitation or the stirring of river runoff into filaments by large mesoscale eddies. The shallow mixed layers raise important questions regarding the likelihood of occurrence of various submesoscale instabilities observed and documented previously at fronts in deep mixed layers. Earlier observations in the wintertime Gulf Stream and numerical simulations of the same suggest the absence of a preference of one over the other. One of the central tasks in this project will be to examine whether the combination of a smaller Coriolis parameter in the subtropics and shallow mixed layers lead to a preference for symmetric instability over ageostrophic baroclinic instability. Such a preference has important implications as coarse-resolution climate models currently have a parameterization for baroclinic instability in the mixed layer but none for symmetric instability. This project also includes an analysis of the effects of Stokes drift, within the Craik-Leibovich framework, on the instabilities accompanying shallow mixed-layer fronts. Together, the set of proposed simulations have the potential to greatly enhance our knowledge of submesoscale frontal mechanisms in shallow mixed layers, thus building on our current knowledge of such mechanisms in deep wintertime mixed layers."

The Center goal is to enhance knowledge of basic properties and environmental characteristics, toxicity, and applications of nanomaterials. There is a compelling need for studying potential toxicity of nanomaterials and advancing efficient, fast and inexpensive computational approaches to predict toxicity of new species. Understanding of structures, characteristics and biological activities of man-made nanomaterials is critical to prediction of their impacts on the environment and human health. Nanoparticle exposure is common, but short- and long-term exposure effects are currently not fully understood, especially since the primary and agglomerate sizes, surface area, and the characteristics of the surface play such important roles. Conversely, nanotechnology can also be used to create new nanomedicines, sensors, pollutant filters and catalysts with important societal benefits.<br/><br/>The Interdisciplinary Nanotoxicity Center focuses on two research subprojects: addressing nanomaterials discovery and deployment. Subproject 1 focuses on multifunctional nanoparticles and their model counterparts: structures, properties, interaction with environment and applications. The aim of this project is to systematically study structure, energetics and optics of metal and semiconductor nanoparticles and their bioconjugates in various environments. Multifunctional environmental safe magnetic core-plasmonic shell nanopaticle based assay for the detection of toxic pathogens selectively from water will be designed and developed, and the possible use of multifunctional nanoparticles for selective removal of toxic pathogens from drinking water is investigated.  <br/><br/> Subproject 2 investigates toxicity of nanoparticles as a function of environmental factors: experimental studies and computational modeling to include different aspects of the development and production of nanomaterials and investigation of their toxicity. The overarching goal is to develop an operational model for directing production of green metal oxide nanoparticles and to conduct in vitro and in vivo toxicological studies under selected environmental conditions by using engineered metal oxide nanoparticles of controlled size and shape. In addition, computational studies are carried out to develop reliable computational models effective for prediction of physico-chemical characteristics and toxicity of nanomaterials. <br/><br/>Both research areas are strongly interconnected and designed to enhance knowledge of basic properties and environmental characteristics, toxicity, and applications of nanomaterials.

The investigators use administrative data from IRS returns to analyze the effects of taxes and transfers on both inequality and economic activity. The proposed activity will significantly advance our knowledge in the analysis of inequality, taxes, and transfers. Such an understanding is crucial to evaluate the costs and benefits of government tax and transfer policies and hence help policy makers design better tax and transfer systems. This research will also develop a model for partnerships between government statistical agencies (the office of Tax Analysis of the US Treasury and the Statistics of Income division of the IRS) and researchers that could be fruitful both for advancing scientific knowledge but also for improving the design and the practical implementation of tax and transfer policies. In the case of the California Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) project, lessons from the research could be used to further improve the design of the EITC program. Lastly, the investigators integrate the measurement of economic growth with the measurement of inequality by developing a new tool ""Distributional National Accounts"". This new tool has the potential to inform the current debate on inequality.<br/><br/>Specifically, this research uses administrative data to analyze behavioral responses to taxation and inequality in four related contexts: (1) evaluate the effects of the 2013 tax increases at the top of the distribution on income reporting, tax avoidance, and economic activity; (2) evaluate the 2015 California EITC on both tax evasion and labor supply of single parents; (3) evaluate the effects of state income and inheritances taxes on the mobility of individuals across US states; (4) combine US tax return data with National account data to create Distributional National Accounts in order to integrate national accounting analysis with inequality analysis and be able to provide statistics on the distribution of overall economic growth by socio-economic groups in the United States. The first three projects offer innovative research designs analyzing large administrative data using tax policy variations, while the last project aims at offering better distributional statistics to the public that can help bridge the gap between the analysis of economic growth and inequality analysis."

Functional connectivity, or correlations in patterns of brain activation (measured via fMRI), is thought to reflect this inter-regional communication. But communication between brain regions ultimately depends on structural connectivity: the white matter tracts that, either directly or indirectly, connect them. This proposal is aimed at resolving two open questions: 1) What are the dynamic relationships between structural and functional connectivity, for the key networks known to be involved in reasoning and other higher cognitive processes, as these develop together across childhood?, and 2) How do these dynamic relationships affect developmental improvements in reasoning ability? The answers that we obtain will provide both fundamental insight into the development of brain connectivity and mechanistic insight into the development of reasoning ability. This knowledge could impact future research both on educational and training programs designed to teach reasoning ability, and on interventions or medical programs designed to correct problems in reasoning. <br/><br/>To address these questions, we will combine fMRI, DTI, and behavioral data from three longitudinal developmental datasets, collected at UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and Vanderbilt University. By combining datasets, we are able to examine longitudinal data from 400 children and young adults between the ages of 6 and 22. Our primary measures of interest include a) intrinsic functional connectivity between specific regions of interest; b) structural connectivity, measured via fractional anisotropy along tracts that connect these regions; and c) reasoning ability, measured via standard cognitive tests. Our main analyses will focus on connectivity within and between two brain networks, the fronto-parietal network and cingulo-opercular network, which are most closely associated with reasoning and other higher cognitive functions. Mixed-model regression analyses will be employed to examine concurrent relationships among structural and functional connectivity in these networks and reasoning ability. Multivariate latent difference score models will be employed to examine lead-lag relationships. The outcome of this research will be a model of interacting structural and functional connectivity development across childhood, and of how the co-development of these two indicators of neural communication relates to developmental improvements in reasoning ability."

This study will investigate midges in Lake Mývatn, Iceland, and why their abundance fluctuates over 4 orders of magnitude in irregular cycles lasting 4-7 years. Adult midges that emerge from the lake die on shore. During high-midge years, the weight of midges that are deposited in the surrounding heathland is equivalent to 10 humpback whales, providing food for predators and scavengers, nutrients for plants, and the basis for local agriculture. By synthesizing results from field samples and experiments over several population cycles, this project promises new insights into fundamental scientific questions about the causes and consequences of population outbreaks. The project will engage graduate and undergraduate students who will work at Mývatn each summer, providing them exposure to extreme biology as well as to educational diversity, as they work in both the lake and on the shoreline under the tutelage of an interdisciplinary group of scientists. The public will learn more about midge outbreaks through an ongoing 'Smidge of Midge' blog.<br/><br/>Ecosystems that show huge changes through time can reveal the ecological forces that stabilize or destabilize natural dynamics. This project involves both long-term data collection in aquatic and terrestrial systems and targeted experiments to test specific hypotheses. The aquatic data collection will build and expand on an existing database that dates back to the 1970s. The project has added weekly monitoring of many additional variables, including midge larvae density, benthic primary production, and pelagic nutrients. The collection of terrestrial data has continued with the monitoring of midge infall and arthropod communities along transects around the lake that were established in 2008. A suite of targeted experiments will address a wide range of research questions such as (i) the role that midges play as ecosystem engineers, changing benthic conditions to favor large-bodied epibenthic cladocerans over small-bodied infaunal species, (ii) the mutualistic effect that midge larvae have on algal growth, and (iii) the importance of midge adults for the flowering of carnivorous plants. These experimental projects are led by graduate students as part of their PhD theses, and by undergraduate interns as independent projects. This combination of aquatic and terrestrial experiments together with regular sampling will test hypotheses about how the lake and shoreline ecosystems are linked together. The research will examine whether the instability of the lake ecosystem could drive instability of the surrounding ecosystem on land."

The first part of the project will create software for modeling stratigraphy, the layers of rock that accumulate in sedimentary basins around the world.  The patterns of the sedimentary layers, or strata, depend on the complex interplay of changes in sea level, tectonics and the supply of sediments.  The model will be appropriate for modeling stratigraphy over time scales of from 10,000 to millions of years, will be applicable to many settings, and made broadly available for use by other scientists. There is very limited publically available software for this type of stratigraphic modeling.  The second part of the project will apply the new software package to an area off of western Turkey.  This is an area where stretching of the crust is causing the land to sink and accumulate layers of sediment. Mapping of the layers by Turkish colleagues show a complex pattern of both subsidence and uplift of the bay over the last 1 million years due to faulting. Changes in sea level that shifted the coastline back and forth over the 100,000-year glacial cycles provide a framework for interpreting ages of the strata. We will model the stratigraphy to determine the tectonics and contribute to assessing the seismic hazard of this region. It has been subject to recent earthquakes up to M6 and historic earthquakes up to M7. The project will provide training for a young Turkish scientist, and a U.S. undergraduate student, adding to their abilities to quantitatively model stratigraphy and estimate tectonics.<br/><br/>The Gulf of Kusadasi is one of the most seismically active regions of the Western Anatolian Extensional Province with active fault systems expressing N-S extension, E-W compression, and NE-SW and NW-SE strike slip.  High-resolution Turkish multichannel seismic data image an extensional basin, the offshore extension of a rift cutting the area, and two uplifted zones at high angle to it. The preserved sediments contain thirteen stratigraphic sequences composed of prograding deltas with shingled clinoforms that have been correlated to glacioeustatic cycles going back to >1 Ma. The sequences are cut by faults with varied orientations, and they reveal associated patterns of subsidence and uplift. These deposits can thus be used to quantify the vertical motions and fault offsets, and thereby constrain the tectonics of the region. The sequences, interpreted as due to the 100,000 year glacio-eustatic cycles, provide a clear temporal framework for deciphering the tectonic and sedimentary history of the region. We propose to use a numerical sequence stratigraphic model to reproduce the stratal geometries and quantify the vertical motions over the last 1 Ma. In order to do the modeling, we will rewrite Sequence, a code for modeling stratigraphy at a sequence stratigraphic timescale. The calculated subsidence will be used to estimate the extension, after accounting for isostatic unloading by the extension and loading by the sediments. The results will determine whether the area is undergoing pure extension, pure shear, or a mixture of the two. The rates of faulting through time will be estimated and will indicate if the deformation is steady-state, waxing or waning. Quantitative estimates of deformation at this scale are necessary to understand the complex tectonics of the Aegean-Anatolian region, and to better evaluate the earthquake hazard."

Aflatoxins are a class of mycotoxins, toxic chemicals produced by fungi that often grow on crops. Aflatoxins cause up to 172,000 cases of lethal liver cancer globally per year. This research project will study the production of knowledge about liver cancer and aflatoxin, as well as its causes and prevention by tracing the history of aflatoxins since the early 1960s when it was discovered by veterinarians as being responsible for the widespread death of poultry. The discovery of aflatoxins lead to studies asking if there was a causal link between aflatoxin and liver cancer in humans. In the 1970s, regulators had begun introducing thresholds for aflatoxin in food and feed and for prescribing standardized tests to determine aflatoxin contamination. Plant scientists began to study and identify the conditions of aflatoxin development in crops in order to prevent the occurrence in humans and livestock. This project will focus on how aflatoxin became a health problem, how different scientific disciplines, institutions, and research practices have interacted to produce knowledge about cancer, and how this knowledge shaped regulation and public health interventions. The findings will be used to guide policy targeting health safety and agriculture standards.<br/><br/> <br/>This project contributes to the historical literature on science because biomedical understandings of the relation between aflatoxins and liver cancer has grown more complex, as scientists have studied the synergistic influences of genes, hepatitis virus infections, and aflatoxins on the carcinogenesis of liver cancer with methods of molecular epidemiology and tumor genome sequencing. The results of the research will be of interest to historians of science and scholars of development, regulation, and science policy. The research will be done in archives where scientific records of national and international health organizations are housed. The project will also complete oral histories to document how the disciplines of toxicology, epidemiology, veterinary medicine, and plant sciences have interacted to produce knowledge about cancer and aflatoxins.  The project will explore the relationship of laboratory and field by studying how regulatory regimes and scientific knowledge have influenced each other since the early 1960s. In addition the project will map out the research networks formed by scientists to understand how different scales, disciplines, and settings of research and regulation interacted to produce knowledge about cancer and aflatoxins. The project will show how research interactions, practices and approaches changed as the Cold War ended and genetics gained an increasing importance in the life sciences. A historical understanding of the interaction of regulatory regimes and knowledge-making will help to develop more effective policies."

Successive cycles of overflowing and freezing of water from upstream groundwater sources accumulate enormous quantities of ice, with late-winter aufeis on some rivers attaining thicknesses of 3 to 5 meters, covering up to 20 square kilometers in some Alaskan fields (even larger in Siberia), and storing as much as a third of the annual discharge of the river in the form of ice. In addition, aufeis maintain an unfrozen base throughout winter due to the release of latent heat as water is converted to ice, which warms the underlying sediments, and a thick insulating layer of ice above. Although aufeis have been studied by hydrologists and are known to be required for winter and spawning habitat for important local fish species, understanding of their ecology is poor. In recognition of this, these investigators will conduct a targeted assessment of the ecological importance of a single aufeis field on the Kuparuk River, Alaska as a first step toward developing a hypothesis-driven research program.<br/><br/>The investigators propose that aufeis be viewed as winter oases due to their wet bases that supply water and heat to otherwise frozen habitats. Aufeis also function as summer oases by providing a stable supply of water to riverbed and downstream habitats. This preliminary study will focus on assessing 1) river flow and nutrient chemistry above, within, and below the aufeis field, and 2) the potential for year-round, unfrozen habitat beneath the aufeis field. The investigators will collect water samples for nutrient analysis in transects extending 2.5 km upstream and downstream from the aufeis field. They will collect hourly data on river stage, temperature, and electrical conductivity along each transect. They will also install pairs of piezometers to depths of 1 meter and 2 meters to measure the vertical hydraulic gradient between the underlying aquifer and the surface channel, and dissolved oxygen, temperature, and electrical conductivity of hyporheic waters at these points. Measurements of vertical hydraulic gradient will determine whether river reaches are generally upwelling or downwelling. To estimate volume and the potential seasonal contributions of the aufeis to river discharge they will use precise digital elevation models created from low-altitude vertical photogrammetry. Year-round temperature and electrical conductivity records will provide data for simple end-member mixing analyses to determine the proportion of aufeis meltwater to the river during the thaw season. During freeze-up and into the winter, these records will provide estimates of potential downstream influences of the spring-water downstream of the aufeis if subsurface flow is maintained. In order to assess the vertical influence of aufeis, the investigators will instrument nine transects with digital temperature loggers. They anticipate that loggers directly under the aufeis will never record temperatures below freezing but that those outside the aufeis footprint will. The investigators also propose August and April ground-penetrating radar surveys to determine thaw depths. Finally, PVC wells penetrating about one meter below the surface will be used to sample small invertebrate animals living in river sediments and below aufeis. The project will support two masters-level graduate students and will involve two undergraduate field assistants in the summer fieldwork."

They also influence the social acceptance, government regulation, and economic viability of new technologies and industries. This dissertation uses the context of the unfolding boom in gas and oil production enabled by hydraulic fracturing technology to investigate how alternative conceptions of the risks and benefits of industrial projects structure the mobilization of public opposition and support. First, the research distinguishes between NIMBY (""Not in my backyard"") opponents who mobilize on the basis of perceived local impacts, and ideological opponents who react to the industry from a larger set of political beliefs and values. Second, the researchers examine support for industrial siting that has received little attention in existing scholarship. The project introduces public comments as a new source of data for measuring public opinion. The project has potentially important implications for understanding political dynamics behind decisions to site and expand a rapidly-growing industry. The methods used for this study should be broadly applicable to other areas of study that can benefit from ""big data.""<br/><br/>Current energy development in the United States brings renewed social science to explain public reactions to industrial siting. This research tests ""NIMBY"" (not in my backyard) against a complementary explanation of public response to industrial siting based on residents' ideological commitments to help to reconcile inconsistent empirical findings about the relationship between proximity and opposition. The project will examine 91,000 public comments submitted during the regulatory reviews of hydraulic fracturing in two states, Illinois and New York. First, researchers will generate a comprehensive mapping of the relationship between geographic proximity and mobilization for and against proposed hydraulic fracturing projects. Second, the researchers will combine the comments with measures of community context and with individual-level measures of ideology to evaluate competing explanations of mobilization for, and against, industrial siting in a series of statistical analyses. Finally, as a direct test of the proposed theoretical mechanism, the researchers will use natural language processing techniques to code the body of comments for the different ways that commenters talk about hydraulic fracturing. For research on industrial siting, public comments data offer three specific advantages: (1) they offer a behavioral measure of opposition and support of an industry (2) they are geocoded, allowing for precise measurement of a commenter?s proximity to proposed industrial sites, and (3) the text of public comments gives unprecedented insight into the different conceptions that people develop of industry impacts. The results of the analysis, especially the relative effects of proximity and political ideology, may have implications for understanding the dynamics of other policy debates. Finally, the proposed project will demonstrate innovative approaches based on natural language techniques and machine learning concepts to studying these dynamics using existing public records, as well as the use of rigorous multiple methods."

The research will be conducted by Dr. Meredith Welch-Devine (University of Georgia) and Dr. Brian J. Burke (Appalachian State University), anthropologists affiliated with the NSF-supported Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program in southern Appalachia. Drawing on more than 80 years of data, Coweeta scientists have developed projections of future environmental change in the region and have outlined anticipated effects on local biodiversity and ecosystems. Their scientific findings provide a rich resource for local environmental governance and adaptation planning. In parallel, local non-scientist residents of the same region have gathered their own experiential data on biodiversity and change, transmitting it across generations and developing their own theories of its causes and consequences. Unfortunately, such local theories are rarely studied systematically even though they can be contribute significantly to science and to improved policy making. Place-based theories enhance science findings by connecting broad-scale changes to specific locations and micro-level change processes, as well as to the livelihoods, landscapes, and issues that move people to act. Because lay theories can significantly shape how we as a society respond and adapt to the changes around us, it is important to understand where local knowledge comes from and how it is affected by local history, economy, and culture.<br/><br/>The Coweeta region provides an ideal venue for such an investigation because of the availability of comparative scientific data. Also, the region is home to a mix of long-term and newcomer populations with different ways of engaging the natural world. For some residents, nature provides their livelihood, while others have been drawn to the area by its scenic beauty and recreation opportunities. Recognizing that plants and animals are central to people's experiences of their environment, the researchers have chosen to focus on perceptions of biodiversity. They will construct a sample of 90 local residents stratified by how long they and their families have lived in the area (multi-generational residents, one or two generation residents, and newcomers). The researchers will conduct life history and environmental interaction interviews with all members of the sample. An additional 45 residents will be asked to complete comprehensive freelisting exercises to elicit their cognitive models of the natural world, which will be complemented with follow-up interviews focused on changes in the freelisted items. The researchers will also conduct semi-structured interviews with resource managers and environmental policy makers; analyze official documents for differential inclusion of local and scientific knowledge and concerns in policy making; and conduct participant observation at relevant community events. Findings will document how local non-scientists experience and understand the same environmental changes that Coweeta scientists are measuring and recording. Parallel research, funded elsewhere, is being conducted in France, Zimbabwe, and Cameroon; data will be analyzed at the country level and then across the four countries through synthesis workshops. The overall goal is to understand how perceptions of environmental change vary, why they vary, and what the implications are for planning and policy."

Functional connectivity, or correlations in patterns of brain activation (measured via fMRI), is thought to reflect this inter-regional communication. But communication between brain regions ultimately depends on structural connectivity: the white matter tracts that, either directly or indirectly, connect them. This proposal is aimed at resolving two open questions: 1) What are the dynamic relationships between structural and functional connectivity, for the key networks known to be involved in reasoning and other higher cognitive processes, as these develop together across childhood?, and 2) How do these dynamic relationships affect developmental improvements in reasoning ability? The answers that we obtain will provide both fundamental insight into the development of brain connectivity and mechanistic insight into the development of reasoning ability. This knowledge could impact future research both on educational and training programs designed to teach reasoning ability, and on interventions or medical programs designed to correct problems in reasoning. <br/><br/>To address these questions, we will combine fMRI, DTI, and behavioral data from three longitudinal developmental datasets, collected at UC Berkeley, UC Davis, and Vanderbilt University. By combining datasets, we are able to examine longitudinal data from 400 children and young adults between the ages of 6 and 22. Our primary measures of interest include a) intrinsic functional connectivity between specific regions of interest; b) structural connectivity, measured via fractional anisotropy along tracts that connect these regions; and c) reasoning ability, measured via standard cognitive tests. Our main analyses will focus on connectivity within and between two brain networks, the fronto-parietal network and cingulo-opercular network, which are most closely associated with reasoning and other higher cognitive functions. Mixed-model regression analyses will be employed to examine concurrent relationships among structural and functional connectivity in these networks and reasoning ability. Multivariate latent difference score models will be employed to examine lead-lag relationships. The outcome of this research will be a model of interacting structural and functional connectivity development across childhood, and of how the co-development of these two indicators of neural communication relates to developmental improvements in reasoning ability."

Forming drug nano particles, by way of controlling the drug crystal formation process, is one tool to overcome this low solubility hurdle.   Acoustical energy has been shown to aid in the formation of drug crystallization however, current acoustical technologies are not able to reliably achieve the crystal size and distribution needed for many new drug candidates.  A reliable method for nanoparticle drug production will allow better and more effective drugs to make it to market.  Additionally, the Pharmaceutical industry is transitioning from batch to continuous flow manufacturing processes.  This has significant impact on cost, responsiveness, and quality control of the drug supply chain, and will enable more rapid and lower cost drug development and manufacturing.<br/><br/>The proposed project will develop equipment and processes that enable the continuous manufacture of drug nano and micron sized particles by controlling the crystallization using a novel focused acoustical field.

However, almost all submarine basalts have lost much of their volatile inventory by degassing when they are erupted, which has led to a major loss of the reliable chemical data needed to identify pristine chemical signatures from Earth's mantle. As a result, there is significant uncertainty and controversy in our understanding of the origins of volatiles and their fluxes into and out of the Earth. This research carries out analyses of the very rare occurrences of undegassed mid-ocean ridge basalts to obtain information on the mantle isotopic composition of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and noble gases (helium, neon and argon). Collectively, these gases can be used synergistically to better understand how Earth's atmosphere and oceans formed and evolved. Mid-ocean ridges are fundamental geologic features of Earth's surface, and one of the most intriguing challenges in geosciences is understanding the processes by which they are created and evolve. The chemical and isotopic data resulting from this project are fundamental in this regard, and will provide benchmarks for years to come for models of degassing at ocean ridges and the origin and evolution of Earth's volatiles. Broader impacts of the work include funding an institution in Oklahoma, a state that receives comparatively little federal money (i.e., an EPSCoR state) and the development of new international collaborations with French scientists. It also uses NSF-funded analytical facilities at Oregon State University and develops new methods for analyzing noble gases in rock samples, building infrastructure for science. Findings will also be incorporated into classes taught by the investigators and used to develop a new seminar for graduate students centered on modeling of reservoirs, processes and fluxes in chemical geodynamics. <br/><br/>The scientific goals of this research are to test the extent to which regions of the upper mantle beneath mid-ocean ridges and continental rifts are similar in their volatile abundances and isotopic compositions on a global scale. Analyses of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and noble gases in undegassed mid-ocean ridge basalts will allow, for the first time, testing of the inter-relationships of noble gas and major volatile isotopes  in CO2, N2, and H2O without employing degassing corrections. This allows a direct test for regional heterogeneity in the upper mantle. The research also specifically addresses the questions: (1) What proportions of the volatiles C, N and H2O in the upper mantle are primordial versus recycled; (2) do carbon stable isotopes in the ultra-depleted mid-ocean ridge basalts carry a record of earlier depletion in low degree melts that appears to be required in formation of the ultra-depleted source; (3) what is the behavior and concentration of N in the depleted upper mantle; and (4) what record of early Earth processes is preserved in the primordial isotope ratios of upper mantle noble gases."

Solutions to this complex problem will necessarily span multiple spatial scales, time scales, and disciplines. Integrated decision models can aid researchers, engineering practitioners, and policy makers in moving away from short-term fixes toward holistic sustainability solutions. The proposed research develops an integrated decision model for coal-fired power plants that investigates the effects of market conditions, regulatory policy, power plant emission control processes, and materials performance on the cost of sustainable electricity generation.<br/><br/>The most significant barriers to performing integrated assessment of coal-fired power plants are uncertainties in: 1) the cost and efficacy of wastewater treatment technologies for compliance with proposed effluent limitation guidelines issued by the EPA; 2) the interaction effects between air and water emission control technologies during phased implementation of emission regulations at coal-fired power plants; 3) the viability of alternative wastewater treatment processes that circumvent auxiliary power consumption by using waste heat from coal-fired power plants processes; and, 4) the role that new membrane materials might play in enabling these alternative water treatment processes in the future. The proposed work will fill these fundamental knowledge gaps and integrate the findings into an aqueous emissions control decision model that guides policy, directs compliance pathways, motivates technology development, and enables the reliable prediction of future emissions. The most significant barrier to stakeholders using integrated decision-making tools to inform compliance pathways at coal-fired power plants is that these academically-derived tools rarely evolve with stakeholder needs. The proposed stakeholder engagement process, beginning with a research prioritization workshop, continuing through yearly meetings, and culminating in a simple and adaptive decision tool, will increase the probability that this model is widely adopted. Additional outreach and educational tasks are integrated into the model development process and span the K-12, undergraduate, and doctoral research communities. The principal investigator (PI) will engage high-school students in documenting aqueous emissions from Ohio River Valley coal-fired power plants.

For example, as animals feed, their strategies for acquiring food changes. The impact of food odors has a very different effect on a hungry person than one who has just had a large meal. This project brings together laboratories from the Case Western Reserve University Biology department and the Cleveland Museum of Natural History to examine changes in hunting strategy that occur as praying mantises feed. The biology laboratory will examine changes in brain systems that control movement as the insect feeds or receives injections of hormones associated with feeding. Insects provide advantages for monitoring brain activity for long feeding periods. Results will demonstrate how brain systems that are altered by hormones associated with feeding affect hunting and will increase our general understanding of the mechanisms by which hormonal changes alter animal behavior. The museum laboratory will expand the study to a wider range of praying mantis species. The project also has a unique educational component. Project related material will be developed into new high- and middle-school teaching modules for the Cleveland Museum of Natural History's award winning distance learning program, which has reached thousands of students in 48 states. These programs align with Ohio's New Learning Standards. Modules will be offered for free for the duration of the project and 3 subsequent years.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the highly structured central complex insect brain region that has received much recent attention. Numerous forms of sensory information coupled with motor effects and the presence of behaviorally relevant neuromodulators imply an important role for the central complex in behavioral adaptation. Yet, no study has brought all these components together to demonstrate how these brain circuits generate context dependent adjustments in natural behavior. This project seeks do that by relating changes in praying mantis hunt strategies to central complex activity patterns recorded by multi-channel tetrode implants as the hunt takes place in one generalist and two specialist praying mantis species. Tetrode wires will be implanted in the insect's central complex. Then after recovery the subject will be moved to an arena where it hunts either live prey (cockroach nymphs) or artificial prey (moving dots on a computer screen that makes up the floor of the arena). The artificial stimulus allows repeated trials to provide quantitative data on neural activity associated with hunting. Neural and behavioral changes will be documented as physiological state is modified by feeding or insulin injection. Comparative studies will clarify how evolution acts on brain structures to shape behavior for specific niches. Successful completion will be transformative both in our understanding of the central complex's role in behavioral adjustment and, more generally, in defining mechanisms by which brain regions in all animals can alter adaptive behavior, thereby establishing the praying mantis as a new general model for behavioral selection."

Steady-state maintenance of a high production to biomass ratio implies that, on average, these organisms grow, die and are replaced once every week. Predatory infection by viruses has emerged as the primary mechanism responsible for the high mortality rates of phytoplankton populations. Despite the importance of viral mortality in structuring marine microbial ecosystems, little is known about the fundamental mechanisms that regulate host-virus interactions. Phytoplankton are inherently dependent on light and photosynthesis. Given the need for host resources, the viruses that infect these organisms must, therefore, also fundamentally depend on light and photosynthesis. This project will explore the relationship between light and viral infection to develop a framework for how light influences viral infection and phytoplankton mortality in the surface ocean. The widespread phytoplankton species Emiliania huxleyi, and its associated virus, Coccolithovirus, has emerged as the prominent model system for investigating algal-viral interactions due to its ecological relevance and collective mechanistic insight from numerous physiological, molecular, biochemical, genomic, and field studies. Laboratory-based culture studies will be used to elucidate the role light plays in mediating infection in E. huxleyi, specifically addressing whether light is required for viral infection as well as identifying the light-regulated host metabolic processes that viruses may co-opt for successful infection and production. These observations will then be extended to natural populations using manipulative, field-based experiments to elucidate the role light plays in structuring infection in the surface ocean. This project provides hands-on training for a Rutgers University undergraduate student, as well as a postdoctoral researcher. To facilitate ocean literacy, researchers will work with the Education and Public Outreach staff and Tilapia Film, LLC to develop an educational video based on research findings and the Next Generation Science Standards. This video, aimed at middle, high school, and undergraduate students, expands on an already successful video series that highlights scientific practices through real research investigations.  It will be open access and disseminated through existing connections to the New Jersey Science Teacher Association, the National Science Teachers Association, the National Marine Educators Association, and the National Biology Teachers Association. <br/><br/>Predatory infection by viruses is the primary mechanism responsible for the high lysis rates observed in phytoplankton populations. As the most abundant biological entities in aquatic environments, viruses turn over more than a quarter of the photosynthetically-fixed carbon, thereby fueling microbial foodwebs and short-circuiting carbon export to higher trophic levels and the deep sea. Despite its importance, estimates of viral-induced mortality are rarely included in global models of net primary productivity and deep carbon export, in part because we lack a mechanistic understanding of the fundamental factors that regulate host-virus interactions. For viruses infecting obligate photoautotrophs, there is an inherent and fundamental interaction between light and the infection process, as well as a dependence on light-regulated host metabolic processes that may be required for viral replication. Using the model algal host, Emiliania huxleyi and its associated Coccolithovirus, this project addresses the hypotheses that: 1) infection dynamics in E. huxleyi are driven through light-dependent processes, specifically that light mediates viral entry and replication, and that viruses redirect host energy to maximize viral replication, and 2) light increases viral decay relieving hosts of viral pressure. This mechanistic, cellular framework will then be used to elucidate the role light plays in structuring infection in natural coccolithophore populations using manipulative field-based experiments. Given that light is one of the most fundamental, readily, and easily measured features of the ocean, this work will ultimately provide a context for modeling the biogeochemical impact of viral infection in the global ocean."

One fundamental question is: can any of the potential envionmental drivers of evolutionary change be reconstructed with enough precision to allow us to relate them with confidence to the episodes of speciation, extinction and cultural evolution known to anthropologists, and thereby test their relationships in time and space?<br/><br/>This team of paleoanthropologists and earth scientists plans to analyze climate and other environmental histories to provide direct tests of key hypotheses linking environmental  history and mammal (including early human) evolution by collecting and analyzing detailed paleoenvironmental data at three key anthropological sites in Africa. They will collect continuous paleoenvironmental records by drilling long sediment cores from ancient lake beds in the northern Afar, Ethiopia (~3.8-2.9 million years ago-Ma), the Baringo Basin, Kenya (~3.2-2.35 Ma), and the Turkana Basin, Kenya (~2.3-1.42 Ma), and relate these records to the outcrops in the same basins that contain early human and other mammal fossils, as well as stone tools in the younger time periods. As a group these basins contain some of the most critical evidence for human evolutionary history in Africa. Although past investigators have reconstructed climate and other environmental histories from the outcrops in which the fossil humans and artifacts have been found, such environmental records are highly discontinuous due to the nature of the sediments where the fossils occur, and are unsuitable for many of the most informative geochemical records available today because of the weathering that has affected outcropping sediments. Drilling lakebeds near the fossil sites gets around these problems, because lake sediments accumulate much more continuously, and because drilling into the subsurface allows unweathered samples to be collected  Funding for the drilling costs for this project has been secured from other sources: with the IPG funds the team will analyze the cores to generate quantitative and high resolution records of changes in temperature, precipitation, vegetation, fire and volcanic activity and other factors which may have influenced human evolution.<br/><br/>The primary research goal is to obtain long cores from these basins, each of which span critical intervals in human evolution and are close to hominin fossil and archaeological sites. The researchers will apply state-of-the-art paleoenvironmental and paleoclimate methods to these cores to assemble high resolution records covering much of the past four million years of East African environmental history. The team will then evaluate existing hypotheses and generate new hypotheses linking climate history to early human physical and cultural evolutionary adaptations. The paleoenvironmental and paleoecological data collected from the drill cores will be linked directly in time and space to the nearby fossil human, mammal and stone tool records by way of the numerous volcanic ashes present in both the cores and outcrops, along with other dating techniques. By comparing the new records to similar records from nearby ocean sediment cores the researchers plan be able to distinguish local from global drivers of environmental change and in the process test a series of hypotheses linking key events in human evolution with climate and other aspects of environmental history. Finally, the team will use these new, combined paleoenvironmental and paleoanthropological data sets, combined with novel modeling techniques to better understand how landscape and climate change across various scales of time and space may have affected the availability and predictability of critical ecosystem resources upon which early humans would have depended. <br/><br/>This project will greatly expand our understanding of African climate history and will be an opportunity to invigorate interest in human evolution and its relationship to climate with the US and African public. The project will train many American and African students during its field, analytical and internship/synthesis phases, and will generate numerous informal science learning opportunities  through our collaborations with the National Museums of Kenya and Ethiopia and the Smithsonian Institution."

Just as every day we walk through doors of houses, offices, schools, and shops; every minute, ions that are essential to life pass through doors of biological cells. These doors on the surface of cells are called ion channels and transporters. Situated in cellular membranes, these special  proteins control which ions move across the membrane and when. Among these proteins are the CLC proton/chloride antiporters, which regulate the influx of protons and the outflow of chloride ions in a coupled manner. Details of how the CLC proton/Chloride antiporters work in transferring protons remain elusive.  Moreover, it is still under debate if (and how) the proton interacts with chloride ions during its journey through the translocation pore. Professor Lin and his research team, which includes two undergraduate students, seek answers to these questions through computer simulations. They are developing advanced computational techniques that combine quantum- and classical-mechanical models.  They then apply these methods to study the CLC transporters. As malfunctioning doors can block us from reaching our destination, malfunctioning ion channels and transporters can disrupt normal life processes and cause diseases. The research by the Lin group seeks to deepen our understanding of how the CLC transporters work at a fundamental, molecular level, which may, in turn, assist the development of novel therapies for diseases related to these protein malfunctions.<br/><br/>The Grotthuss-shuttling mechanism for proton transfer involves dynamical reorganizations of covalent and hydrogen bonds. While reactive force fields (also called molecular-mechanics, or MM) and multistate empirical valence bond models are efficient in treating water dissociation and proton hopping.  The extension of these models in complex environments is challenging because of the rapidly increasing number of potential parameters needed to account for more valence configurations. Moreover, electronic-structure information is missing for the bond breaking/forming processes, which are described ideally by quantum mechanics (QM). QM simulations are limited to small model systems (~hundreds of atoms) due to high computational costs. The Lin group is developing novel adaptive-partitioning QM/MM methods for proton transfer in complex environments. The adaptive-partitioning schemes feature an on-the-fly smoothly updated mobile QM region that follows the proton wherever it goes. As such, a finite-size QM region becomes infinite and can, in principle, sustain simulations as long as needed. The new algorithms are applied to the study of a prototype CLC antiporter from E. coli. With on-the-fly computed QM/MM potentials and an explicit treatment of protons, the dynamics simulations explore the hydrophobic pore hydration, water wire formation, proton translocation, and chloride ion protonation in the CLC antiporter."

While it is clear that women are increasingly represented in these formal registries and producer groups, it is less certain that this trend is correlated with women's increased access to secure land holdings, credit, and agricultural services; heightened participation in local governance; or increased economic decision-making power at home. According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization, if women and men had access to the same resources, agricultural yields could increase 20-30%. In addition, many environmental conservation and global climate change mitigation programs are based upon the idea that farmers will undertake activities such as planting trees or protecting endangered species, yet relatively few studies have assessed whether and how women farmers will respond to these environmental initiatives. The expanding number of women farmers across the globe will certainly have far-reaching implications for policies related to both poverty alleviation and environmental management. Given the importance of stable agricultural livelihoods to North American issues such as migration, food security, environmental conservation, and drug enforcement, a better understanding of women and agriculture is in our vital interests.<br/><br/>Dr. Sarah Lyon and Dr. Tad Mutersbaugh of the University of Kentucky explore whether activities associated with EQ-GVCs (ethical quality global value chains) correlate with measures of gender equity. This research will be conducted in highland coffee producing areas of Mexico where the percentage of women farmers participating in certified organic and fairtrade coffee production has increased from just 9% to well over 40% in a little over a decade. Oaxaca is also marked by extensive cultural and organizational heterogeneity. The project explores two questions: First, it assesses how this increase affects gender equity in local governance and whether it increases women's land holdings and their access to credit and agricultural training. Second, it examines how women farm, asking whether women have different practices and expectations in comparison with men. To answer these questions, researchers will survey coffee plots; interview both women and men farmers; and observe and participate in activities related to coffee production, producer organizations, and community life. Researchers will also interview coffee buyers, donors, and coffee industry participants in order to better understand the links between gendered production practices and larger market transformations. The research will help identify barriers to women's participation in agriculture with the goal of informing future policies and programs to promote gender equity and women's access to productive resources. This would not only help explore methods for increasingly agricultural output in developing countries, but also assess the scale at which these strategies enhance the life prospects of future generations."

It consists of two pieces: a deep, multi-band map covering 5000 square degrees, and a ""cosmic movie"" of a thirty square-degree region obtained by revisiting that area at least once every six nights.  The wide-area survey will measure positions, shapes, fluxes, and approximate (photometric) redshifts for around 300 million galaxies, and the time-domain survey will discover and measure light curves for several thousand supernovae and other transients.  Data collection began in August 2013 and is planned to run for five annual, six-month observing seasons.  Wide community and public access to the DES data are a vital component of the DES Data Management system, and will make the survey valuable in the long run to groups far beyond those actually carrying out the survey.  DES uses the Dark Energy Camera (DECam), a new wide-field, facility instrument built by the DES collaboration and installed at the prime focus of the Blanco 4-meter telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.<br/><br/>This award supports continued operation of the DES Data Management (DM) system at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA) from January 2016 to August 2021, that is, through the end of DES survey science operations.

The goal is to expand the scope of the popular regression discontinuity (RD) design, which uses the presence of fixed eligibility cutoffs (e.g. Medicare eligibility at age 65) for estimating the effect of public and private policies on some outcome of interest (e.g. health care utilization, mortality) among individuals who are close to the cutoff. In particular, the research provides new methodological tools for dealing with two important and frequent practical challenges for RD designs: (i) how to deal with situations in which some individuals can manipulate their program eligibility, and (ii) how to infer the effect of the program on individuals who are far away from the cutoff. Because RD designs have become a popular method to evaluate many government policies, it is important to address these two challenges. This research, therefore, will improve the statistical methods we use to assess the effects of public policy, and it will allow economists and other social scientists to provide better information to policymakers.<br/><br/>This research project consists of two parts that each addresses an important limitation of standard RD designs. The first part of the project is motivated by the limitation that some units (i.e., individuals or families) may be able to manipulate their value of the so-called running variable used to determine eligibility (e.g., income, which could be misreported). Manipulation is problematic if it leads to units just to the left and right of the cutoff being no longer comparable due to self-selection, in which case treatment effects are no longer point-identified. The investigators show that interesting causal parameters can still be partially identified in RD designs when the running variable is manipulated. This research derives sharp bounds on treatment effects for the (unobserved) subgroups of units not engaging in a manipulation, and also derives new econometric methods to estimate these bounds and to conduct inference. The second part is motivated by the limitation that RD designs only allow for the identification of treatment effects for marginal units at the cutoff and are generally not informative about treatment effects for units away from the cutoff. This lack of external validity limits the usefulness of RD estimates in guiding policies that would change assignments of units away from the cutoff. The investigators develop a latent factor-based approach to the identification and estimation of treatment effects away from the cutoff. To the extent that the source of omitted variables bias in a RD design can be modeled using latent factors, the running variable is one of a number of noisy measures of these factors. Assuming other noisy measures are available, causal effects for all values of the running variable can be non-parametrically identified and estimated."

Vision is complex, and different solutions for vision exist across the animal kingdom, such as compound eyes in insects versus simple eyes in humans. However, many features enabling vision, such as genes, structures and signaling methods, are similar across animals. This is why insects are a useful model for our general understanding of the processes involved in making eyes functional. This project focuses on members of a group of insects that consistently live at low light levels, in a place where food and mates are close by and need not be visually recognized over large distances. The eyes of these insects have been dramatically reduced from the fully developed daylight version, but they are still functional. In studying the process of this reduction over evolutionary timeframes, this project aims to understand the sequence of events and which stimuli led to the reduction (or loss) of visual structures, and what minimum level of organization and complexity is required to maintain a functional eye. Results of this interdisciplinary research will contribute to our understanding of the robustness and adaptability of complex biological systems. This study is also directly relevant to the fields of phylogenetics, evolutionary systems biology, neurobiology and bioengineering. In addition to scientific advancement, this project will reach and train students from diverse backgrounds at all levels of education, including middle/high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. Research results will be integrated into inquiry-based education modules for middle and high school teachers. <br/><br/>This project uses phylogenomic, histological, and molecular methods to test several hypotheses regarding the evolution of reduced, yet functional, eyes in parasitic bat flies. Bat flies are an ideal system for this type of study because 1) all species have reduced or lost eyes, and there are variations among species in the degree of reduction; 2) the group is derived from fully visual, free-living predatory ancestors, and extant species can be studied for comparative analyses; and 3) due to life history characteristics of the group, bat flies trace two distinct ecological niches - the developmental niche (where pupae are deposited) and the host niche (where adult bat flies occur in association with bats) - that introduce variations in host proximity and light environments among species. Comparative studies of the variation in host and developmental niches among species, and the resulting structural patterns in micro- and macro-eye anatomy across the phylogeny will allow for the testing of hypotheses related to 1) which ecological features are driving the evolution of eye reduction and 2) how different physical domains (e.g. macromorphology, micromorphology, and gene expression) evolve relative to these driving forces."

The research will be conducted by Dr. Meredith Welch-Devine (University of Georgia) and Dr. Brian J. Burke (Appalachian State University), anthropologists affiliated with the NSF-supported Coweeta Long Term Ecological Research (LTER) Program in southern Appalachia. Drawing on more than 80 years of data, Coweeta scientists have developed projections of future environmental change in the region and have outlined anticipated effects on local biodiversity and ecosystems. Their scientific findings provide a rich resource for local environmental governance and adaptation planning. In parallel, local non-scientist residents of the same region have gathered their own experiential data on biodiversity and change, transmitting it across generations and developing their own theories of its causes and consequences. Unfortunately, such local theories are rarely studied systematically even though they can be contribute significantly to science and to improved policy making. Place-based theories enhance science findings by connecting broad-scale changes to specific locations and micro-level change processes, as well as to the livelihoods, landscapes, and issues that move people to act. Because lay theories can significantly shape how we as a society respond and adapt to the changes around us, it is important to understand where local knowledge comes from and how it is affected by local history, economy, and culture.<br/><br/>The Coweeta region provides an ideal venue for such an investigation because of the availability of comparative scientific data. Also, the region is home to a mix of long-term and newcomer populations with different ways of engaging the natural world. For some residents, nature provides their livelihood, while others have been drawn to the area by its scenic beauty and recreation opportunities. Recognizing that plants and animals are central to people's experiences of their environment, the researchers have chosen to focus on perceptions of biodiversity. They will construct a sample of 90 local residents stratified by how long they and their families have lived in the area (multi-generational residents, one or two generation residents, and newcomers). The researchers will conduct life history and environmental interaction interviews with all members of the sample. An additional 45 residents will be asked to complete comprehensive freelisting exercises to elicit their cognitive models of the natural world, which will be complemented with follow-up interviews focused on changes in the freelisted items. The researchers will also conduct semi-structured interviews with resource managers and environmental policy makers; analyze official documents for differential inclusion of local and scientific knowledge and concerns in policy making; and conduct participant observation at relevant community events. Findings will document how local non-scientists experience and understand the same environmental changes that Coweeta scientists are measuring and recording. Parallel research, funded elsewhere, is being conducted in France, Zimbabwe, and Cameroon; data will be analyzed at the country level and then across the four countries through synthesis workshops. The overall goal is to understand how perceptions of environmental change vary, why they vary, and what the implications are for planning and policy."

These sea level fields from the Bayesian model solution will be made freely and publicly accessible and available. With their estimates of uncertainty, these fields would be suited for use in state estimation efforts on century time scales. This project is a partnership between academia and industry and would also support an early career scientist.<br/><br/>The main objectives of this project include: reconstructing regional maps and global time series of sea level going back two centuries; elucidating roles of internal versus external forcing of global mean multidecadal sea level change; diagnosing the impacts of static and dynamic processes on multidecadal regional sea level changes; and evaluating the veracity of climate models. The outcomes will fill basic knowledge gaps, improving understanding of ocean circulation and climate change.  To increase basic knowledge of ocean circulation and climate change, and to cope with difficulties related to the sparseness of sea level data in space and time, a hierarchical Bayesian model will be brought to bear on extant datasets (altimetry, tide gauge, vertical land motion), giving observation-based constraints on sea level behavior over the last two centuries. Exploration of the underlying ocean dynamics based on hierarchical Bayesian model solutions will elucidate the physical drivers and space-time scales of multidecadal sea level changes and provide a basis to evaluate climate models."

The additional uncertainty in the climate, the rapid depletion of the world's aquifers, urbanization, and the industrialization of developing economies, all indicate that humanity is in the midst of a water crisis. These challenges have far reaching implications for global security, ecosystem health and economic development, as well as the health safety of both the wealthy and the poor. The principal investigators (PIs) propose to bring together a working group of educators, industry partners, and government officials that will participate in a one day planning workshop to develop a larger regional conference for the broader New England water community. The PIs believe the workshops and conferences will catalyze a New England Water Education Ecosystem that will identify, address, and share solutions to improve water supply abundance, access and safety.<br/><br/>The challenges of solving problems related to safe, abundant, and affordable water supply are critical to the regional, national, and global security. The workshops will be in the northeast incorporating universities ready to tackle these emerging water problems,  and partners in industry are critical to the implementation and commercialization of new technologies. In 2014, a small group of individuals incorporated the New England Water Innovation Network (NEWIN) with the goals of serving as a common voice for the regional water industry and identifying best practices for brining water technologies to market. Additionally, New England Water Innovation Network recognizes the importance of engaging and energizing the next generation of water professionals. The New England Water Education Ecosystem will provide a venue to bring industry partners together with educational partners. In addition, many aspects of the water issues have significant policy components. The State of Massachusetts recognizes the significance of these challenges and is actively engaged in programs to foster water innovation at the both the basic research and commercialization phases. Cultivating connections between higher education, water industry, and government will speed the development of solutions and help prepare students to face these complex challenges."

This large-scale database will contain information on products and services directly offered by public and private firms to their customers over the last 20 years, as well as links to the US Patent and Trademark Office's patent data for the last 20 years. The resulting database and analysis tool will enable researchers to answer many questions, including: How do industries, competition in industries and their products change over time? What are the dynamics of product introduction rates for private and public firms and how did private firms and their array of product offerings change during the recent financial crisis? What products are introduced by public and private firms following increases in patenting activity within an industry? Do the patenting firms introduce the new products or do non-patenting firms? Which government policy changes were most effective in stimulating the growth of entrepreneurial firms, and in what kind of markets did these policies work best? What local product market conditions are most conducive to successful entry by entrepreneurial firms and how do waves of innovation impact product market competition? What economic forces trigger firms to cross the boundary between public and private status? In addition to impacting academics that study innovation and how industries change over time, business decision makers, consumers, and regulators will benefit from the new industry designations. Businesses can use the database and web based tool to assess existing market structure around new products. This will facilitate more informed decisions about where and when to commit scarce resources to enter new markets. By examining the nature of existing competition and market structure by both public and private firms, large and small, entrepreneurs can also better assess the likely success of their new ventures. Regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) can also benefit from refined knowledge of industry structure and product market boundaries. <br/><br/>This project will produce a highly scalable approach for mining historical Web data to create comprehensive product-based databases and tools to query and analyze this data. This integrated database will be built using firm web pages from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine project.  Using the text from these web pages, the resulting database will classify firms as competitors, which will be used to build new industry definitions. These new industry definitions will be based directly on the product and service descriptions firms use to interface with customers. The project will produce a publicly available web-based analytical tool based on ""Elasticsearch"" (www.elasticsearch.com). This tool will allow users to query the database of public and private firms, their competitors, and the products they offer. Using this tool, a user will be able to input a company, or list of companies, and the tool will provide that company's product descriptions and a list of its competitors that produce similar products, along with the corresponding similarity scores, indicating the strength of competitive links.  The analytical tool will also allow a firm's local product market to be visualized as a network.

The PI argues that the different modes through which electoral alternatives are presented to voters are critical to understanding how people vote, and the extent to which certain candidates or parties are disproportionately advantaged or disadvantaged by different types of ballots. The countries selected for this project (Argentina, Chile, Ecuador, El Salvador and Honduras) offer the opportunity to measure a variety of outcomes affecting representation as a result of variations in the ballot structure. Such variations in presenting the electoral offering may benefit certain parties, offset the probability of women being elected, and/or affect whether candidates' personal attributes observed in the picture of them included on the official ballot affect the probability of being elected. Studying the consequences of ballots and their features on electoral outcomes can help to explain how and who people vote for, shedding light on different aspects of representation, such as minority groups' access to legislative seats and the effectiveness and relevance of informational cues provided by the ballot. The results of this project will provide policymakers and citizens considering or engaged in ballot design reform with invaluable information regarding the potential impact of reforms on representation and accountability in particular and the quality of electoral democracy in a given political system more generally.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>This project contributes to a deeper understanding of the electoral process by addressing the role of ballot design and vote casting procedures on representation. Two different analytic strategies are applied to evaluate how the way the electoral offering is presented to the voter affects voter behavior and electoral outcomes. First, the project uses observational data to assess whether different ballot designs lead to different electoral outcomes. Second, given that the causal mechanism operates at an individual level, and that voter behavior can be influenced by a myriad of factors, an experimental research design is used to assess how voters may judge candidates' traits in actual elections. For the first strategy, the PI uses data from Argentina provinces that have replaced the traditional partisan paper ballot with different versions of the Australian ballot. She analyzes how different presentations of the electoral offering benefit certain parties using a quasi-experimental research design. Using Chilean municipal data from 1992 to 2008, the PI examines the probabilities of candidates from underrepresented groups being elected given their order placement on the ballot in open list multi-member proportional representation systems. For the second strategy, she conducts experiments in three open list system countries (El Salvador, Ecuador and Honduras) that employ panachage (where voters have the opportunity to distribute their multiple votes among candidates from different parties in multimember districts). The experiments assess whether candidates' personal attributes affect the probability of being elected and how contextual information provided in the voting booth alters voters' evaluation of and preference for candidates by supplying additional tools to decode informational cues."

Oliver (USDA-ARS/University of Missouri) <br/><br/>Developing drought-tolerant corn varieties that make efficient use of available water is vital to sustain the estimated 9 billion global population by 2050. Corn takes up most of its water through a particular set of roots called the nodal roots. Under drought, the nodal roots must grow through dry soil to reach available water to sustain the plant. However, very little is known about the mechanisms that allow nodal roots to achieve this essential feat. This project will use a combination of physiological and genomics approaches to define the molecular mechanisms underlying how the nodal roots are able to maintain growth under drought. The information generated by the project will lead to the development of innovative approaches to enable corn and other cereal crops to access more water and increase yield under drought, and will thereby contribute to the essential goals of increased food security and stability. In addition to the training of students and postdoctoral associates, the project will provide summer research training internships for undergraduate students from Fort Valley State University, a Historically Black University (HBCU) located in Fort Valley (GA). The project will also disseminate research findings and provide information to the general public through various communication, technical training and outreach activities. These include but are not limited to science communication workshops involving journalism students and hands-on training workshops on metabolomics and the use of bioinformatics tools to analyze and integrate multi-omics datasets.  <br/><br/>This project integrates root physiology and functional genomics [transcriptomics, plasma membrane proteomics, and metabolomics (including hormones)] to deliver a comprehensive understanding of nodal root growth responses to water deficit stress in both controlled laboratory studies and in the field. The project focuses on a maize inbred line that has been shown to exhibit superior ability for nodal root growth under water-limited conditions. A collaborative interdisciplinary team will address the following specific objectives: 1) elucidation of the physiological and molecular basis of nodal root growth responses to water stress using a novel divided-chamber model system for precise imposition of water deficit conditions around the growing roots; 2) characterization of nodal root growth and root growth zone transcriptomic responses in response to water stress in the field, using ""drought simulators"" for precise imposition of the timing, intensity and duration of drought; and 3) integration and analysis of all datasets using a suite of informatics tools to identify candidate genes that will be genetically validated in plants. This multidisciplinary strategy provides unique opportunities to greatly improve basic understanding of root biology under drought, and to broadly train the next generation of plant scientists. Data and biological materials generated by this project will be accessible to a project website (to be developed) and through deposition to long-term repositories such as the Maize Genetics Cooperative (for germplasm), and MaizeGDB, Gramene and the NCBI's GEO and SRA (for sequence and phenotypic datasets)."

Defects are deviations from the ideal expected structure of a material and include: missing atoms, the appearance of impurity atoms, and rearrangements of atoms. Most conventional three-dimensional semiconductor materials, such as those that make up the transistors in computers, rely on the intentional incorporation of defects to modify their properties to enable them to function as required for the application. For instance, photovoltaic solar cells rely on incorporation of defects to enable sunlight to electricity conversion as a renewable energy source. Thermoelectric materials rely on defect incorporation into semiconductors to convert heat to electricity, which is used to power satellites in space and may be useful for waste heat harvesting on earth. The properties of defects in semiconductors are closely linked to the behavior of electrons in the material, which is governed by the laws of quantum mechanics. <br/><br/>The goal of this research is to develop and apply predictive computational tools to understand how defects control the properties of emerging two-dimensional materials that are promising for applications. Single atomic-layer thick graphene with a honeycomb arrangement of carbon atoms that resembles atomic-scale chicken wire provides one example.  In comparison to three-dimensional materials, the defect-property relationships in two-dimensional are not well understood. A unique coupling between material structure and electronic properties arises in 2D materials and leads to a distinct and rich defect physics that is different from 3D materials.

Recent advances in 2D materials have raised intriguing possibilities with applications in electronics, photonics, energy harvesting and storage, and other areas. A critical barrier is that defects in 2D materials exhibit behavior from those in 3D materials, and currently they are not well understood. A unique coupling between topological structure and electronic structure arises in 2D materials and gives rise to a distinct and rich defect physics. The goal of this work is to exploit this unique coupling to enable unprecedented functionality through the purposeful addition of defects in a controlled way.<br/><br/>To merge aspects of topological structure and electronic structure in 2D materials, the PI will invoke approaches that span length scales from the atomic scale where a quantum mechanical description based on the interacting Schrodinger equation is required to micrometer-scale topological defect structures. Statistical mechanics frameworks that predict the defect topology of a 2D material that deforms in 3D will be directly linked with first-principles electronic structure methods to demonstrate that topology and chemical doping can be integrated in ways that enable new functionality. First-principles approaches will utilize both hybrid density functional theory and emerging, high-accuracy quantum Monte Carlo methods. Since quantitative first-principles descriptions of defects require extraordinarily high accuracy, potential limitations to the accuracy attainable will be assessed. The integrated approach will be used to answer several outstanding questions on defect physics in 2D systems.  These include: (a) How can topological structure and functionalization be integrated to design high-performance 2D thermoelectrics? (b) How can topological structure and chemical doping be integrated to design high-performance 2D photovoltaics? (c) Do 2D materials undergo defect-mediated ductile/brittle transitions as their 3D counterparts? (d) What is the nature of the defect-induced insulator to metal transitions in 2D materials? <br/><br/>The research effort will be integrated with educational and outreach activities to increase the diversity of the next generation technical workforce. Through the introduction of a new course entitled ""Community Outreach for Science and Engineering Researchers,"" the effort targets several key junctures of the student development pipeline from middle school to graduate students.

Between 6,000 and 12,000 residents (including children) had severely high levels of lead in the blood and experienced a range of serious health problems. Therefore, rapid and accurate water quality test for various contaminants such as lead (Pb) ions at the point of use is a core requirement for drinking water safety. <br/><br/>This project aims to: (1) validate a prototype handheld device for lead ion detection using Flint water samples and improve the handheld device performance, and, (2) enable rapid screening of Flint water for lead ions during the pipeline retrofitting, during seasonal transition from winter to summer, and after, at various point-of-use systems. This RAPID project will contribute to the development of a rapid and low-cost detection method for lead ions in Flint water using a handheld device. Similar to the glucose meter for home use, the handheld device consists of a meter and a disposable (one-time use only) sensor test strip based on reduced graphene oxide. The device is capable of detection of lead ions in water at a concentration well below the maximum contaminant level defined by the US EPA. In this project, the prototype handheld device will be validated for rapid lead ion detection in Flint water samples, which is representative of lead-contaminated drinking water. The resulting handheld device will then be used to enable rapid screening of Flint water for lead ions during the pipeline retrofitting, during seasonal transition from winter to summer, and after new point-of-use systems being developed. The anticipated result of the proposed project is a reliable and rapid point-of-use handheld device for lead screening in drinking water."

Studies demonstrate that larvae of species that inhabit shallow waters can behaviorally respond to changing oceanographic conditions by moving vertically into currents that can promote their transport to coastal, nearshore habitats where they settle to bottom habitats and complete their life cycle. However, the oceanographic mechanisms that promote such transport, and how they might be impacted by infrequent events such as El Niño, are poorly resolved. Given that El Niño events might increase in frequency and magnitude under climate change, it is imperative to assess how El Niño affects larval transport and larval settlement. To this end, this study will use an unprecedented set of nearshore biological and physical measurements spanning pre-El-Niño, during El Niño, and the predicted return to El Niño neutral conditions, to test mechanistically how larval transport and settlement respond in a nearshore coastal environment. This project will also provide educational and research opportunities for students at the University of San Diego, a liberal arts university. At least one laboratory exercise demonstrating the impacts of El Niño on larval transport and settlement will be developed for undergraduate students, and students will be recruited to participate in all aspects of the project to provide them with hands-on research experience. This research will form the basis for the thesis work of at least one M.S. graduate student. Finally, given that the research falls within a Marine Protected Area, results will be broadly disseminated and shared with coastal managers and the CA Department of Fish and Wildlife.<br/><br/>Larval transport and settlement are fundamental processes for understanding the population dynamics of benthic invertebrates. Previous studies and unpublished observations indicate that El Niño events profoundly impact community and population processes, and in Southern California, El Niño effects range from alteration of larval transport and settlement of local populations, to the geographic expansion of subtropical species. This research will test the hypothesis that the current (2015-2016) El Niño event will result in a reduction of barnacle larval transport and settlement in Southern California nearshore habitats. Two mechanisms might be involved; first, a deepening of the thermocline forced by El Niño would result in reduction of larval transport by internal tidal bores, a mechanism that requires shallowing of the thermocline. Second, the distribution of larvae of littoral barnacles would be deeper, more offshore, and less constrained to nearshore habitats during El Niño than in El Niño neutral conditions, resulting in a reduction of nearshore larval abundance and settlement. The effects of El Niño on nearshore circulation, hydrography, larval transport and settlement in Bird Rock, Southern California, will be measured by a) deploying an array of instrumentation to measure temperature, pressure (waves) and currents; b) measuring daily barnacle larval settlement, and; c) assessing cross-shore and depth distribution of invertebrate larvae. These observations will be contrasted with two years of comparable observations taken at Bird Rock in 2014 (El Niño neutral conditions) and 2015 (during El Niño). Additionally, the investigators will measure weekly settlement at Bird Rock, and at Dike Rock, a site 7 km to the north, where previous observations at the end of the 1997/1998 El Niño indicated that barnacle settlement was very high. This will enable the evaluation of the generality of the settlement response as El Niño conditions eclipse, and examination of how settlement varies along a coastline."

These wetlands are the main terrestrial source of natural organic matter (NOM) that causes the yellowish tea-colored water in coastal blackwater rivers such as Waccamaw River in South Carolina (SC). Importantly, the concentration of NOM is highly correlated with concentrations of total mercury and methylated mercury, mediating the bioavailability and transport of mercury in coastal ecosystems. On October 1-5, 2015, the interaction between a stalled extratropical cyclone (nor'easter) and hurricane Joaquin caused torrential rain and extensive flooding in a short period of time in the coast of SC, resulting in a large volume of NOM exported from the forested wetlands into the coastal blackwater rivers. Such large quantity of NOM exports on an unprecedented scale could potentially mobilize relatively stable and recalcitrant pools of mercury and carbon from the forested wetlands into the blackwater rivers. This highly interdisciplinary research will dramatically improve understanding of mercury and carbon biogeochemistry under extreme weather conditions and demonstrate the relationships within the context of ecosystems. This study represents a new and unique collaboration between four investigators with different specialties from three universities including two assistant professors respectively in a minority serving institution and an undergraduate institution. This study will also raise the awareness of the impacts of extreme weather events on low-lying coastal areas in the Southeastern United States. <br/><br/>Coastal wetlands are considered as important carbon and mercury sinks. However, extreme weather events under the changing climate could alter the equilibrium status, affecting the stability of carbon and mercury pools in the coastal ecosystems. The goal of this RAPID research is to study the influences of the extreme flooding on carbon and mercury cycles and associated biogeochemical processes in coastal wetlands and blackwater rivers. Specifically, the study will integrate field investigations, controlled field experiments, and hydrological computer modeling to examine carbon and mercury exports, sources, and temporal trends along the hydrograph of the extreme flooding event. The research team has been collecting water samples along the Waccamaw River since Oct 4, 2015, representing the rising limb of the hydrograph. Samples were analyzed for general water quality, dissolved organic carbon, ultraviolet absorbance, nutrients, cations, anions, total mercury, and methylated mercury in the filtered and unfiltered samples. To determine the carbon and mercury budget, a hydrological model will be used to estimate the total water discharge from this flooding event that went into Waccamaw River. The PIs will engage in a transformative research study to assess novel decomposition process routes of terrestrial organic matter in forested wetlands under the influence of extreme flooding event.  The PIs contend that the novel method of using stable mercury isotope along the hydrograph of the flooding event, coupled with measurements of dissolved organic matter in water using ultraviolet/visible and fluorescence spectroscopy, will be useful for understanding the relationships between carbon and mercury in coastal blackwater rivers. Determining the temporal variation of carbon and mercury will be useful for developing a mechanistic and landscape-level understanding of how extreme flooding events affect the biogeochemical process of terrestrial organic matter in coastal ecosystems."

For example, as animals feed, their strategies for acquiring food changes. The impact of food odors has a very different effect on a hungry person than one who has just had a large meal. This project brings together laboratories from the Case Western Reserve University Biology department and the Cleveland Museum of Natural History to examine changes in hunting strategy that occur as praying mantises feed. The biology laboratory will examine changes in brain systems that control movement as the insect feeds or receives injections of hormones associated with feeding. Insects provide advantages for monitoring brain activity for long feeding periods. Results will demonstrate how brain systems that are altered by hormones associated with feeding affect hunting and will increase our general understanding of the mechanisms by which hormonal changes alter animal behavior. The museum laboratory will expand the study to a wider range of praying mantis species. The project also has a unique educational component. Project related material will be developed into new high- and middle-school teaching modules for the Cleveland Museum of Natural History's award winning distance learning program, which has reached thousands of students in 48 states. These programs align with Ohio's New Learning Standards. Modules will be offered for free for the duration of the project and 3 subsequent years.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the highly structured central complex insect brain region that has received much recent attention. Numerous forms of sensory information coupled with motor effects and the presence of behaviorally relevant neuromodulators imply an important role for the central complex in behavioral adaptation. Yet, no study has brought all these components together to demonstrate how these brain circuits generate context dependent adjustments in natural behavior. This project seeks do that by relating changes in praying mantis hunt strategies to central complex activity patterns recorded by multi-channel tetrode implants as the hunt takes place in one generalist and two specialist praying mantis species. Tetrode wires will be implanted in the insect's central complex. Then after recovery the subject will be moved to an arena where it hunts either live prey (cockroach nymphs) or artificial prey (moving dots on a computer screen that makes up the floor of the arena). The artificial stimulus allows repeated trials to provide quantitative data on neural activity associated with hunting. Neural and behavioral changes will be documented as physiological state is modified by feeding or insulin injection. Comparative studies will clarify how evolution acts on brain structures to shape behavior for specific niches. Successful completion will be transformative both in our understanding of the central complex's role in behavioral adjustment and, more generally, in defining mechanisms by which brain regions in all animals can alter adaptive behavior, thereby establishing the praying mantis as a new general model for behavioral selection."

However, almost all submarine basalts have lost much of their volatile inventory by degassing when they are erupted, which has led to a major loss of the reliable chemical data needed to identify pristine chemical signatures from Earth's mantle. As a result, there is significant uncertainty and controversy in our understanding of the origins of volatiles and their fluxes into and out of the Earth. This research carries out analyses of the very rare occurrences of undegassed mid-ocean ridge basalts to obtain information on the mantle isotopic composition of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen and noble gases (helium, neon and argon). Collectively, these gases can be used synergistically to better understand how Earth's atmosphere and oceans formed and evolved. Mid-ocean ridges are fundamental geologic features of Earth's surface, and one of the most intriguing challenges in geosciences is understanding the processes by which they are created and evolve. The chemical and isotopic data resulting from this project are fundamental in this regard, and will provide benchmarks for years to come for models of degassing at ocean ridges and the origin and evolution of Earth's volatiles. Broader impacts of the work include funding an institution in Oklahoma, a state that receives comparatively little federal money (i.e., an EPSCoR state) and the development of new international collaborations with French scientists. It also uses NSF-funded analytical facilities at Oregon State University and develops new methods for analyzing noble gases in rock samples, building infrastructure for science. Findings will also be incorporated into classes taught by the investigators and used to develop a new seminar for graduate students centered on modeling of reservoirs, processes and fluxes in chemical geodynamics. <br/><br/>The scientific goals of this research are to test the extent to which regions of the upper mantle beneath mid-ocean ridges and continental rifts are similar in their volatile abundances and isotopic compositions on a global scale. Analyses of carbon, nitrogen, hydrogen, and noble gases in undegassed mid-ocean ridge basalts will allow, for the first time, testing of the inter-relationships of noble gas and major volatile isotopes  in CO2, N2, and H2O without employing degassing corrections. This allows a direct test for regional heterogeneity in the upper mantle. The research also specifically addresses the questions: (1) What proportions of the volatiles C, N and H2O in the upper mantle are primordial versus recycled; (2) do carbon stable isotopes in the ultra-depleted mid-ocean ridge basalts carry a record of earlier depletion in low degree melts that appears to be required in formation of the ultra-depleted source; (3) what is the behavior and concentration of N in the depleted upper mantle; and (4) what record of early Earth processes is preserved in the primordial isotope ratios of upper mantle noble gases."

An outcome of this study will be an enhanced, value-added sea level dataset based on the hierarchical Bayesian model approach, which will complement the available sea level estimates from altimetry, tide gauges, and ocean circulation models. These sea level fields from the Bayesian model solution will be made freely and publicly accessible and available. With their estimates of uncertainty, these fields would be suited for use in state estimation efforts on century time scales.

The outcomes will fill basic knowledge gaps, improving understanding of ocean circulation and climate change.  To increase basic knowledge of ocean circulation and climate change, and to cope with difficulties related to the sparseness of sea level data in space and time, a hierarchical Bayesian model will be brought to bear on extant datasets (altimetry, tide gauge, vertical land motion), giving observation-based constraints on sea level behavior over the last two centuries. Exploration of the underlying ocean dynamics based on hierarchical Bayesian model solutions will elucidate the physical drivers and space-time scales of multidecadal sea level changes and provide a basis to evaluate climate models."

They can choose from a variety of strategies to delineate the location of an object, using for instance the directions where the sun rises/sets, projecting their own body axes onto the object, or introducing another object as landmark. These descriptions provide an opportunity to probe into the way people think and talk about space as a cultural practice shared among the members of a speech community. Linguists and psychologists are particularly interested in the factors that influence the selection among such strategies. Language, cultural factors such as education and literacy, and environmental variables such as topography and population geography have all been hypothesized to play a potential role in this process. <br/><br/>A critical but understudied question in this connection is the impact of bilingualism. If the language a person speaks influences how they represent space cognitively, then speakers of multiple languages might think in ways that differ from how monolinguals think. Such hypothetical effects offer an opportunity to gain rich and detailed information about the role of language in cognition. This project focuses on Taiwan to explore the effect of language, culture and environment on the way monolingual and bilingual speakers represent space in language and cognition. Due to its migration history, Taiwan can be considered a natural linguistic laboratory with a great amount of variation among bilingual speakers in terms of age, education and residential neighborhoods. The test languages, Mandarin Chinese and Taiwanese Southern Min, a distant cousin of Mandarin, exhibit very distinct features and practices of use in spatial reference. The project will document the use of spatial descriptions by monolingual and bilingual speakers of these languages and study the impact of the first and second language, education, literacy, and the environment on spatial cognition"

Plants go through successive phases in their lifecycle. During vegetative development plants convert the energy from sunlight into resources. When plants switch to flowering, the accumulated resources are incorporated into the seeds. As a consequence, the timing of flowering impacts both plant biomass production (biofuel production) and the number of fruits and seeds produced (yield). Plants adjust the time to flower formation based on environmental cues, most importantly the season of the year and the temperature. When seasonal cues are optimal for flowering, plants produce a substance called  ""florigen"". Florigen moves throughout the plant and triggers production of flowers. A closely related substance named ""antiflorigen"" prevents flower formation in the absence of the seasonal cue. Despite its important function, it is not understood how antiflorigen prevents flowering, nor how antiflorigen activity is overcome to allow flower formation. The proposed activities will address these deficiencies. Insight gained can be used to enhance desirable traits in crop species. The research will be discussed with the general public in conjunction the national citizen science ""Project Bud Burst"" at the Morris Arboretum. Contributions to enhancing high school education will be made through lectures and workshops during the yearly high school summer research academy and hands on teacher professional development. Finally, undergraduates will be engaged in research related to the role and regulation of antiflorigen in laboratory classes and in the research lab.<br/><br/>This proposal will address two general questions. The first is how TFL1 represses onset of flower formation. Using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and analysis of gene expression, the proposal will identify the genes directly repressed by the antiflorigen TFL1 prior to the onset of flower formation. Both candidate gene and unbiased genomic approaches will be employed. Follow-up molecular and genetic studies will assess the biological contribution of the TFL1 target genes to TFL1 function. Finally, the proposed activities will elucidate how TFL1 is recruited to its target loci. The second question to be addressed is how TFL1-mediated repression is overcome to allow formation of the first flower upon perception of inductive cues. Using biochemical, genetic and genomic approaches, the proposed activities will test the hypothesis that competition by the FT florigen for access to shared target loci and subsequent negative feedback by LFY and AP1 on TFL1 expression play critical roles in this process. Mathematical modeling will be used to determine whether the uncovered interactions explain the behavior of the system."

Vision is complex, and different solutions for vision exist across the animal kingdom, such as compound eyes in insects versus simple eyes in humans. However, many features enabling vision, such as genes, structures and signaling methods, are similar across animals. This is why insects are a useful model for our general understanding of the processes involved in making eyes functional. This project focuses on members of a group of insects that consistently live at low light levels, in a place where food and mates are close by and need not be visually recognized over large distances. The eyes of these insects have been dramatically reduced from the fully developed daylight version, but they are still functional. In studying the process of this reduction over evolutionary timeframes, this project aims to understand the sequence of events and which stimuli led to the reduction (or loss) of visual structures, and what minimum level of organization and complexity is required to maintain a functional eye. Results of this interdisciplinary research will contribute to our understanding of the robustness and adaptability of complex biological systems. This study is also directly relevant to the fields of phylogenetics, evolutionary systems biology, neurobiology and bioengineering. In addition to scientific advancement, this project will reach and train students from diverse backgrounds at all levels of education, including middle/high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. Research results will be integrated into inquiry-based education modules for middle and high school teachers. <br/><br/>This project uses phylogenomic, histological, and molecular methods to test several hypotheses regarding the evolution of reduced, yet functional, eyes in parasitic bat flies. Bat flies are an ideal system for this type of study because 1) all species have reduced or lost eyes, and there are variations among species in the degree of reduction; 2) the group is derived from fully visual, free-living predatory ancestors, and extant species can be studied for comparative analyses; and 3) due to life history characteristics of the group, bat flies trace two distinct ecological niches - the developmental niche (where pupae are deposited) and the host niche (where adult bat flies occur in association with bats) - that introduce variations in host proximity and light environments among species. Comparative studies of the variation in host and developmental niches among species, and the resulting structural patterns in micro- and macro-eye anatomy across the phylogeny will allow for the testing of hypotheses related to 1) which ecological features are driving the evolution of eye reduction and 2) how different physical domains (e.g. macromorphology, micromorphology, and gene expression) evolve relative to these driving forces."

This project focuses on the Eastern North America continental margin offshore Cape Hatteras that was formed after the breakup of supercontinent Pangaea. A large suite of data has been collected across the transition from continental crust to oceanic crust in this region.  These data will be analyzed and interpreted to obtain an improved understanding of events surrounding the final stage of continental breakup including the relationship between the timing of rifting and the occurrence of offshore magmatism and early opening of the Central Atlantic Ocean.  The project will also provide new information on landslides that have occurred along the margin of the U.S. and an estimate of the number of landslides that might have produced tsunamis.  A postdoctoral researcher will be trained in geophysical data analysis and interpretation, and the results of the proposed work will be incorporated into outreach programs for high school and middle school students.<br/><br/>This project consists of the processing and interpretation of offshore, long-offset multichannel seismic (MCS) data from the Eastern North American Margin. The long-offset MCS data analysis will provide critical new information about the along-strike variations of the complex transitional crust between unambiguous continental and oceanic crust at a smaller-scale than previous studies. The crustal-scale closely-spaced MCS profiles will be essential to image the small-scale heterogeneities of the volcanic products along the margin, spatial patterns in basement topography, thickness of sediment and rift unconformities within the sediments and features within the crust and lithosphere (e.g., faults and crustal thickness variations). MCS imaging of those features are needed to assess the late-stage rifting processes and variations in time and space of these processes. Different kinematic plate models for the earliest stage of evolution of the Central Atlantic Ocean make very different predictions for the half spreading rate. In addition, large-scale segmentation at the modern Mid-Atlantic ridge has also been proposed to be inherited from the geometry of the adjacent continental margin. MCS data from this project will constrain variations in basement roughness, crustal thickness and crustal structure and reflectivity along and across new oceanic crust that will provide important constraints on the early seafloor spreading history and will help to distinguish between competing models."

When authorities are viewed as legitimate, citizens have an enhanced intrinsic motivation to comply with the law and to cooperate with those who enforce it. This research tackles two key questions. What features of enforcement institutions bestow legitimacy on authorities? And what are the consequences of legitimacy for citizen behavior? <br/><br/>It employs both laboratory and lab-in-the-field experiments, the latter of which enhance policy relevance by focusing on subjects from low-income, mostly minority communities, whose experiences of law enforcement may differ from those of typical student subject pools.  Assessing the causal antecedents of legitimate authority is a surprisingly tricky empirical problem. Given that citizens' compliance with the law may be motivated both by deterrence and by citizens' perceptions of legitimacy, how can legitimacy be measured in a way that is separate from citizens' anticipations of punishment? This work employs novel experiments designed to decouple the relationship between citizens' extrinsic (deterrence) and intrinsic (legitimacy-based) motivations."

These signals act through distinct and overlapping signaling pathways, which have been studied extensively. The key factors that control and integrate interactions between these pathways however remain poorly understood at the gene regulation level. A plant's ability to prioritize tradeoffs between growth and defense is critical for optimizing its fitness in an ever-changing environment. How growth- defense tradeoffs are regulated at the molecular level is largely unknown and is a central question in plant biology. Recent evidence suggests that transcription factors (TFs) of the basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) class play important roles in regulating gene expression networks that control growth-defense trade-offs. The goal of this project is to study unknown bHLH TFs in tomato, a representative crop of the Solanaceae and the third most valuable crop family in the world, to provide new knowledge regarding: (1) the transcription circuits that play a major role in tomato growth and defense; (2) the factors that regulate these transcription circuits; and (3) the potential pathways that can be engineered to enhance disease resistance while optimizing plant fitness. Ongoing international collaboration will provide a framework to share emerging concepts, tools and technology. This research will provide hands-on research and mentorship training at the graduate, undergraduate, and high school level with special consideration of women, underrepresented minorities, low-income students, and disabled students.

Recent evidence suggests that the tomato pathogen Xanthomonas euvesicatoria specifically regulates basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH)- controlled transcription circuits to dynamically alter tomato growth and immunity to promote pathogenesis. One of these networks in roots is required for lateral root development and is hypothesized to impact the efficiency of nutrient acquisition. The goals of this research is to: (1) use RNAseq and ChipSeq technologies to study the DH1 transcription network(s) controlling development and immunity in tomato; (2) determine how Xanthomonas directly alters the transcription complex that controls DH1 transcription in tomato leaves to provide mechanistic insight for how pathogens manipulate TF-modules during infection; and (3) define additional bHLH TFs that function in growth and/or immunity in tomato. This information will be used to engineer novel approaches to optimize growth in important crops.

Bacterial sphingolipids are a novel group of compounds that the Principal Investigator (PI) proposes to investigate as signals that can influence the development and evolution of other organisms. These studies may lead to a greater understanding of how communities of microbes, including our own, function and are maintained. The PI is committed to enhancing awareness of the role of host-microbe interactions in the broader educational and research community by integrating these concepts into undergraduate and graduate course curricula, direct mentoring of graduate and undergraduate students, and community presentations at local venues. Importantly, this proposal leverages the location of research to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities. As the major Native Hawaiian-serving institution in the nation, the University of Hawaii at Manoa provides the opportunity to involve Native Hawaiian students in targeted undergraduate research programs and K-12 outreach in STEM fields. Finally the PI will produce short online videos on host-microbe interactions accessible to general audiences in the Hawaiian language. <br/><br/>Animals evolved in seas that swarmed with bacteria, yet the influences of bacteria on animal origins are poorly understood. Historically research on interactions between marine animals and microbes has emphasized bacterial pathogens, but bacteria interact with eukaryotes in other ways, and these interactions can affect animal evolution. Choanoflagellates are the closest living relatives to animals, and their ability to transition between single-celled and multicellular states is relevant to discussions of metazoan origins and their reliance upon bacteria as prey is relevant to discussions of host-microbe interactions. Algoriphagus machipongonensis is a bacterium that is associated with the choanoflagellate Salpingoeca rosetta, and the PI has shown that a novel sphingolipid from this bacterial species regulates multicellular development in the choanoflagellate. Sphingolipids are potent second messengers in eukaryotes, but the functions of bacterial sphingolipids are poorly understood. The discovery that bacterial sphingolipids regulate multicellular development in one of the closest living relatives of animals suggests that these compounds act as signaling molecules in bacteria as well. Three aims are proposed to address the hypothesis that sphingolipids produced by Bacteroidetes bacteria also mediate microbe-microbe signaling via membrane vesicles: (1) Identify and characterize the proteins in A. machipongonensis that are involved in bacterial sphingolipid regulation; (2) Determine and characterize how bacterial sphingolipids affect other prokaryotic cells; and (3) Define the signaling interface between bacterial sphingolipid signals and other cells. These organisms are easily maintained under laboratory conditions, and analyses will be facilitated by the availability of the genome sequences of two choanoflagellates and their prey bacteria, ease of maintaining these organisms under laboratory conditions, their amenability to biochemical and cell biological approaches, and genetic techniques developed by the PI for the bacterial partner ."

Networking improvements will be facilitated by developing a cohesive intellectual community that provides access to mentoring, novel information and new resources, as well as collaboration partners.  Using an intervention into the existing - largely disconnected - scientific community, female faculty will participate in networking workshops, as well as pre- and post-intervention surveys to understand their current networking needs, improvement of their networking abilities over time, and the impact their network ties have on academic collaboration.  The goal of the intervention process is to lower isolation of female faculty in geotechnical engineering by creating and sustaining a supportive national network that drives career success in academia.<br/><br/>This project will apply social network analysis and professional development activities to improve networking and collaboration among geotechnical engineering faculty in order to bridge the geographical distance and connectivity gaps faced especially by female geotechnical engineering faculty.  Building on past efforts of NSF and others, the project will create a network that fosters active tie creation and provides access to collaboration opportunities among geotechnical engineering faculty in the U.S.  The intervention into the existing network combines face-to-face networking meetings and virtual networking practices to increase collaboration opportunities.  The core challenges are: (a) how to sustain the attention network, (b) how to maintain strong connections among female faculty in their immediate professional environments and, (c) how to create weak ties that will help them in situations where their strong ties are unable to provide the social support, collaboration and information that they need.  The outcomes of the research will improve the faculty's understanding of the importance of networking, provide opportunities for sustaining collaborative connections with colleagues across the nation, and equip participants with the knowledge and skills to collaborate in a networked world.  The summative evaluation, including a before and after social network analysis, will evaluate the effectiveness of the purposeful interventions into the existing network of mostly weak ties among geotechnical women faculty and recommend promising practices for use in other disciplines where women face similar challenges."

One way in which past environments are inferred is through the analysis of fossilized animal remains, with mammals featuring prominently. In many studies, recovered cranial and dental remains are analyzed in order to reconstruct past faunal communities from which past environmental conditions are then inferred. An alternate method involves analyses of postcranial (e.g. femora and humeri) elements within an ecological functional framework linking skeletal morphology to locomotory patterns and habitat use. While studies of craniodental remains from smaller mammals, such as rodents, have contributed to understanding of the past, analyses of their postcrania have lagged behind those of other groups, such as African antelopes. As rodents are the most abundant and ecologically diverse group of modern mammals, this project will address this issue and test whether this currently underutilized source of data can be used to reconstruct past environments. By generating an accessible comparative database, the results from this study will be applicable to not only reconstructions of paleoenvironments occupied by early human ancestors, but also archaeological studies and can be adapted for modern small mammal biodiversity surveys and habitat monitoring. This study will also provide public science outreach through presentations in both the U.S. and Africa. These presentations will build upon current collaborations with various institutions and contribute to undergraduate, graduate, and public understating of the natural history of the region. Finally, this project provides graduate training for the Co-PI and undergraduate training through the enrollment of students in Department of Anthropology's Graduate-Undergraduate Mentorship Program at Texas A&M University.   <br/><br/><br/>Utilizing several different methods, this study tests whether analyses of African rodent postcrania can provide useful data for reconstructing past environments. First, using both traditional linear measurements and two-dimensional outlines from digital photographs, this study tests if modern rodent postcrania can be used to identify what taxa (i.e. genus and species) are present, and thus can be used in a similar manner as craniodental remains to reconstruct rodent community composition. Second, traditional linear measurements will also be utilized to test if modern rodent postcrania can be used to assess locomotory patterns within an ecological functional framework to infer habitat use. The correspondence in environmental signals obtained between these two approaches (taxonomic and ecological functional) will then be assessed. After compiling a modern comparative dataset, fossilized rodent postcrania from the South African hominin-bearing sites of Sterkfontein and Swartkrans will be subjected to a dual taxonomic and ecological functional based analysis in order to test previously proposed paleoenvironmental signals that have used other proxy data, including rodent craniodental remains. This study will improve our ability to reconstruct past environments associated with early hominin remains through analyses of a currently underutilized source of data, rodent postcrania, and will help clarify the environmental context at two sites important to our understanding of human evolution."

But anthropologists have documented many cases where groups of human beings find other methods for pursuing sovereignty than through the formation of autonomous nation-states. This project asks what factors influence human beings to seek sovereignty through means other than political independence. The project would aid public policy experts in their efforts to understand and anticipate social movements not only in the United States, where this research is taking place, but in other parts of the world where sovereignty claims have taken new form. In addition, the project would strengthen collaboration among scientists in the mainland U.S. and Puerto Rico, broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences, and train undergraduate and graduate students in methods of scientifically-grounded and empirical data collection.  <br/><br/>Dr. Yarimar Bonilla of Rutgers University explores how notions of citizenship and national identity are reimagined within contexts of shifting and disputed forms of sovereignty. The research explores the Puerto Rican statehood movement, an important site for answering this question as the movement has paradoxically gained popularity among those who have advocated other forms of sovereign status over annexation and statehood. As an unincorporated territory of the United States, Puerto Rico's relationship to the United States has long been ambiguous and misunderstood. Famously described as ""foreign in a domestic sense,"" Puerto Rico is a space where notions of citizenship nationality are hotly debated. For many years the island's commonwealth status promised local residents ""the best of both worlds"" in the sense of offering US citizenship with a measure of local sovereignty. However, as the economy has stagnated over the past twenty years leading to failing infrastructure, a seemingly unpayable public debt, and historic levels of out-migration (resulting in a larger concentration of Puerto Ricans in the continental United States than in the Puerto Rican territory), a growing number of Puerto Ricans currently support political annexation to the United States. This project will examines how and why a large number of Puerto Ricans advocate for Puerto Rico to become the 51st state. Utilizing data collected through archival research, participant observation, surveys, focus groups and individual interviews, the PI will examine how statehood is imagined by its advocates and what problems it is deemed capable of solving. The findings of this research will have broad implications for thinking about the cultural meanings of citizenship in an era of shifting sovereignty and about the current landscape of political possibility in the United States and its margins."

However, despite this, an understanding of how populations around the continent will fare under climate change is poorly understood. A complicating matter is the potential effects of a commercial enterprise in the Antarctic: a fishery targeting toothfish, which are important prey for Weddell seals. Although the species is easily detected and counted during the breeding season, no reliable estimates of continent-wide Weddell seal numbers exist, due to the logistic difficulties of surveying vast regions of Antarctica. Large-scale estimates are needed to understand how seal populations are responding to the fishery and climate change, because these drivers of change operate at scales larger than any single population, and may affect seals differently in different regions of the continent. We will take advantage of the ease of detectability of darkly colored seals when they the on ice to develop estimates of abundance from satellite images. This project will generate baseline data on the global distribution and abundance of Weddell seals around the Antarctic and will link environmental variables to population changes to better understand how the species will fare as their sea ice habitat continues to change. These results will help disentangle the effects of climate change and fishery operations, results that are necessary for appropriate international policy regarding fishery catch limits, impacts on the environment, and the value of marine protected areas. The project will also further the NSF goals of training new generations of scientists and of making scientific discoveries available to the general public. It will engage ""arm-chair"" scientists of all ages through connections with several non-governmental organizations and the general public.

To do this, the project will crowd-source counting of seals on high-resolution satellite images via a commercial citizen science platform. Variation in seal around the continent will then be related to habitat variables through generalized linear models. Specific variables, such as fast ice extent will be tested to determine their influence on population variability through both space and time.

However, recent research has found that, when someone experiences a loss due to the violation of a social norm, moral indignation rather than empathy drives third parties to compensate victims. This research project builds on that finding to investigate the underlying motivation for anger-driven compensation. Using behavioral games from experimental economics and scale measures from psychology, this research tests the general hypothesis that people compensate victims of social norm violations in order to signal their own endorsement of the norm. This research advances the science of giving by providing a more nuanced view of the psychological determinants of giving behavior. This understanding lays the framework for further applied work to increase voluntary assistance as well as norm conformity.<br/><br/>A large body of psychological work has shown that compensation is driven by feeling empathic concern for the victim. Compensatory behavior has been explained as a form of efficient resource sharing through indirect reciprocity. Recent research, however, has demonstrated that, when a loss is due to the violation of a social norm, moral anger, and not empathic concern, drives third parties to compensate victims. Given this difference in motivation from other types of compensatory behavior, this result suggests a distinct psychological mechanism underlying the compensation of victims of social norm violations. As the punishment of norm violators has also been shown to be motivated by anger, punishment and compensation may both be driven by the same psychological mechanism and shaped by the same evolutionary pressures. In light of this similarity, this research develops the norm broadcasting hypothesis: the function of compensating the victim of a social norm violation is to signal the compensator's endorsement of the violated norm. Adapting models of third party punishment, this research explores two possible hypotheses underlying the benefits that this public broadcasting delivers to the compensator, both of which could simultaneously contribute to the emergence of this behavior. The first is the reputation broadcasting hypothesis: by compensators signaling their endorsement of the norm, observers will prefer interacting with the compensator in the future. The second is the norm stabilization hypothesis: by signaling their endorsement of the norm, the compensator mitigates the norm undermining effect of the violation, increasing the likelihood that the norm is maintained and, in the case of cooperative norms, increasing the expected benefit to the compensator from cooperation's surplus generating properties in future interactions. Using a series of modified trust games, the four proposed studies test these three hypotheses. Because the finding that moral anger drives the compensation of victims of norm violations grounds this project, the first study replicates this result with monetary incentives. The second study, designed to test the general norm broadcasting hypothesis, measures whether third parties compensate more when they are being observed by others. The third study tests a prediction of the norm stabilization hypothesis: that those who observe the victim of a norm violation being compensated are more likely to obey the norm themselves. Lastly, the fourth study tests a prediction of the reputation broadcasting hypothesis: that people prefer those who previously compensated a norm violation victim when selecting a partner for a game in a similar social context."

This program will concentrate on the areas of harmonic analysis and approximation theory, areas of mathematics that underlie the representation and approximation of functions and data.  The emphasis will be put on constructive high-dimensional methods of approximation and representation.  Recently, driven by applications in engineering, biology, medicine, and other areas of science, new challenging problems have appeared.  A common feature of many of these problems is that they involve data and multivariable functions in extremely high dimensions, in which setting classical methods of approximation do not work well.  This is an important and rapidly developing area of mathematics.  A recent increase of activity at the interface of harmonic analysis and approximation theory makes the timing perfect for a research program that emphasizes this interplay and will help the cross fertilization of both fields.  CRM is a renowned mathematics research institute which provides excellent facilities for such a program, and both harmonic analysis and approximation theory have historically been strongly represented in the activities of CRM.<br/><br/>The program will include a workshop on ""Function Spaces and High-Dimensional Approximation"" (May 2016), several advanced courses on ""Methods of Constructive Approximation and Harmonic Analysis"" aimed at graduate students and postdocs (May-June 2016), and a Conference on ""Harmonic Analysis and Approximation Theory"" (HAAT 2016, June 2016).  In addition there will be ample time for collaborative research.  The program will bring together different groups of mathematicians working in several areas of analysis and numerical analysis to try to make a breakthrough in high-dimensional problems, which are very important in data compression and processing (critical to information technology applications and medical imaging).  Progress in this area will impact several other mathematical sciences communities, including signal and image processing, numerical mathematics, learning theory, and optimization theory.  The schedule of the events in the program has been carefully coordinated with other European and US events in these fields, which will allow a large number of US-based mathematicians to participate.

Antarctic ice shelves, the ocean-floating margins of the massive Antarctic ice sheet, are showing signs of rapid decline. Ice shelf decay leads to increased discharge of grounded-ice to the ocean, and to mean sea-level rise. Ice shelf disintegration would drive the continental Antarctic ice sheet, in particular the West Antarctica section, to eventual collapse. Ocean waves may provide the tipping force necessary to trigger the failure of a thinned, mechanically weakened ice shelf. Monitoring how the ice shelves are responding to changing oceanic and atmospheric conditions is critically needed, but obtaining such measurements is technologically and logistically challenging. This award supports the development of novel technologies that can meet the challenge.<br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/>The project aims to address the observational gap that exists in Antarctic ice-shelf glaciology for timescales shorter than the few-day ice-fields provided by satellite geodesy and imagery. Through these efforts, a new scientific instrument will be devised and prototyped that closes the gap into the high-frequency (from monthly to sub-seconds) domain where ice shelves respond dynamically to oceanic forcings. This will be accomplished by integrating state-of-the-art GPS and seismometer sensors into a single broadband scientific instrument with data download capabilities in near-real time. This scientific device will be packaged into an ice penetrator that can be air-dropped onto an ice shelf (and tabular icebergs) from a helicopter. The technology readiness of this geodetic-seismic ice penetrator (GSIP) will be assessed based on verification of performance of a functional prototype through both laboratory and field trials. Having continuous, high-resolution GSIP observations of Antarctic ice shelves would provide meaningful constraints to Antarctic ice-shelf decay models, and contribute to an improved understanding of ice-ocean dynamic interactions. GSIPs would greatly simplify logistic challenges by expediting deployment, reduce the on-ice footprint in Antarctica, enhance current capabilities for in situ glaciological observations, and benefit the broader polar community."

Wildfires chemically transform soil organic matter, and mountainous slopes are more prone to erosion after wildfires. Increased sediment transport can lead to increased deposition and accumulation of pyrogenic soil organic matter in surface waters (i.e., rivers and lakes), and the concern is that dissolved organic matter characteristics from wildfires affects the formation of disinfection byproducts. The results from this research will provide beneficial information for utility operators, managers, researchers, and regulators.<br/><br/>Wildfires in forested watersheds transform ecosystems and affect surface water quality. Previous work by the principal investigator (PI)demonstrated that leachates from sediments in wildfire-impacted areas have a greater potential (i.e., increased yield of disinfection byproducts) to form haloacetonitriles after chlorination. Haloacetonitriles, along with other nitrogenous disinfection byproducts, are an emerging area of concern. Although not yet regulated by the USEPA, haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides are more toxic than regulated carbonaceous disinfection byproducts. The proposed study investigates the effect of thermal processes on the formation of nitrogenous disinfection byproducts (haloacetonitriles and haloacetamides) from soil organic matter. Soil organic matter is nitrogen-rich, containing peptide-like material from in situ microbial processes. Soil organic nitrogen is transformed into cyclic dipeptides and heterocyclic aromatic compounds by thermal processes. The objectives are to simulate the transformation of organic matter due to thermal processes, leaching into surface water, and the formation of disinfection byproducts during disinfection processes. Samples will be collected from burned and unburned locations within a wildfire-impacted watershed. Organic nitrogen characterization (i.e., amino acid and NMR analysis) will be used to elucidate which organic nitrogen characteristics are associated with increased haloacetonitriles and haloacetamide formation. In addition to high quality publications, the students involved in this research will have the opportunity to operate the analytical equipment required to produce the needed data during the new Laboratory class that will be designed as an outcome of this project. This will enhance the quality of the teaching and training derived from this proposal. Additionally, the PIs committed to promote the dissemination of these research results through several organizations, such as the Front Range Drinking Water Consortium and the Water Research Foundation."

Even as the trend towards mass incarceration seems to be reversing, a large population of people remains who exit jails and must attempt to reenter society. Racial minorities represent a significant portion of these returning prisoners, notably African Americans and Latinos. Women also have also been affected by mass incarceration; as a result of the War on Drugs, drug felony convictions (in addition to non-violent property offenses) account for nearly 80 percent of the female inmate population (Women in Prison Project 2006). Furthermore, as scholars have demonstrated, there is a social stigma attached to a criminal record that serves to limit the job opportunities of people returning from prison, even more so, when those individuals are minorities. The successful reintegration of former prisoners is a social good that benefits all of society as it reduces the risk of future crime (and the cost of re-incarceration) and makes for a safer, less unequal society.  This study is a qualitative case study of a private re-entry organization in Cleveland Ohio that will help understand the re-entry process.<br/><br/>The proposed research is a qualitative case study of a private reentry organization in Cleveland, Ohio. The major research questions are: 1) Do reentry organizations purposefully broker social and cultural capital for their clientele? How does such brokerage occur? 2) Does the gender of the formerly incarcerated client affect how and what social and cultural capital is brokered by the organization? If so, how? And finally, 3) What is the impact of such brokerage of social and cultural capital on the formerly incarcerated individual who is seeking to reintegrate into society? Data were collected via participant ethnography and interviews with those who make use of the reentry organization and their caseworkers. The intellectual merit of this research is that it will illuminate the sociological processes of reentry of the formerly incarcerated particularly in relation to the brokerage of social and cultural capital by a reentry organization. The findings of the research should have the impact of informing future programming models for future reentry organizations and should also influence policies adopted by the governmental agencies that fund those organizations. The findings of this research will be useful, not only to the reentry field, but also to organizations attempting to reintegrate any stigmatized or marginalized population such as the homeless, the disabled, and refugees. Due to the focus on gender, this research will also be useful for other organizations that work with mixed populations by making them more cognizant of the potential pitfalls of ""gender-neutral"" policies."

The NSF-funded Cyberinfrastructure Engineer (CIE) collaborates closely with researchers to understand their needs and guide their use of cyberinfrastructure to ensure optimal benefit, and also works with university network engineers to make architectural, design, and configuration changes to the cyberinfrastructure to better serve the research community and ensure they are able to fully leverage local, regional, and national cyberinfrastructure. The CIE is part of an emerging program that embeds staff from the university's Research Computing and Cyberinfrastructure (RCCI) unit within key research groups to provide a liaison between these groups and to provide collaborative technical support for their needs in cyberinfrastructure, including high performance computing, data-intensive computing, private cloud, peta-scale storage, and end-to-end network performance. The CIE engages not only with CWRU research groups, but also with their collaborators at other institutions to ensure the optimal use of cyberinfrastructure resources at all institutions and along the network paths that link them. Such activity is a critically important success factor as researchers tackle increasingly large problems and collaborate in geographically distributed research teams, and as they work to converge data-intensive and numerically intensive computing within the National Strategic Computing Initiative. Finally, the CIE participates in formal classroom presentations to students who rely on campus cyberinfrastructure in their research and learning experience in STEM education.<br/><br/>At CWRU, the CIE has primary responsibility for the university Science DMZ , perfSONAR, and data transfer node services.  As the Science DMZ is tightly integrated with the university's high performance computing, data-intensive computing, private cloud, peta-scale online research storage, and near-line research data archive services, the CIE's responsibility extends into all areas of campus cyberinfrastructure and requires close coordination and collaboration with staff having primary responsibility in those areas.  To ensure optimal end-to-end network performance, the CIE routinely works in collaboration with peers at other universities, government institutions, and regional and national networking organizations including Internet2, the Ohio Academic and Research Network, Ohio Supercomputing Center, NIH facilities such as NCBI, DoE facilities such as ORNL, and the NSF-funded national supercomputer centers. The CIE is involved in the university's efforts in IPv6, identity and access management, SDN, and OpenFlow, and works closely with information security and the network security groups."

The stress released during an earthquake (called the stress drop) controls the ground accelerations produced by the earthquake waves, and hence the damage potential. The stress drop is also fundamental to understanding and modeling the physics of the earthquake source, because it defines the energy budget. It is important to know whether stress drop varies from region to region, and with earthquake magnitude. This is because earthquake parameters and ground shaking measurements in regions of high seismicity are often used to estimate hazard in other regions that may have lower historic seismicity rate, for example regions with induced seismicity. However it is currently unknown how much stress drop really varies between earthquakes. The observed variability ranges over a factor of 100 to 1000, which poses significant challenges in interpreting stress drop results. It is often not clear how much of the variability comes from measurement uncertainties, and how much represents real regional variations in fault properties. The investigators will focus on the section of the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield, in central California, where there is a high rate of earthquakes, including distinct sequences of small repeating earthquakes, and the fault also creeps slowly. It is one of the best-instrumented sections of fault in the world. The award will aid the development of a new geophysics group at the University of Oklahoma by supporting a beginning-career female PI, and a graduate student. The student will have the opportunity to be an active participant in the research communities in both Boston and Oklahoma. The research activities will help to establish earthquake research in Oklahoma, a state with increased awareness of earthquake hazard due to dramatic increase in seismicity, and will be integrated into classroom activities.<br/><br/>The large number of earthquakes and the long-term dense networks of seismometers make this region a natural laboratory for understanding earthquake source physics. The multiple-scale dense observational networks provide on-scale recordings for a wide magnitude range; the existing detailed research provides a well-defined context in which to interpret the results. The Investigators propose to apply multi-scale (both large- and small-scale) analysis methods to the dense dataset of earthquake waveforms aimed at resolving the continuing controversy regarding earthquake scaling and variability. The investigators will calculate the stress release for a large number of earthquakes in multiple ways, using different subsets of the data. The work will focus on three distinct questions: (1) Is the apparent scaling of stress drop an artifact of poor data with limited bandwidth, limited magnitude range, and inadequate correction for site and propagation effects? (2) Do the stress drops of repeating earthquakes at Parkfield change with time as a result of the change in strain rate from the 2004 M6 Parkfield earthquake? (3) What data quality and analysis requirements are needed to confirm that spatial and temporal variations observed here and in future studies are real? The proposed research will increase understanding of the earthquake source process, both at Parkfield, and beyond. The methods developed, and the greater understanding of their limitations and constraints should enable a higher resolution of earthquake source parameters, and hence seismic hazard maps, worldwide."

The goal is to help us understand the economic institutions that help foster cooperation among individuals.  These institutions range from formal law enforcement to on-line information sharing systems, to word of mouth social networks, and even to the use of money. In order to understand how these institutions help support the cooperation that is necessary for economic growth, the PI plans to work in two steps.  First, what kinds of cooperative behavior could emerge in the absence of such institutions? Second, what new kinds of behavior can emerge when a particular institutions is introduced? The research will develop foundational results in game theory. It will also help us understand the value of information sharing institutions, centralized vs decentralized enforcement institutions, and the ways in which wealth can be employed in society. The award also funds new curriculum development in game theory and political economy for graduate students and undergraduates.<br/><br/>The project includes several interrelated research projects on dynamic games and institutions, divided into three parts: game-theoretic foundations of enforcement institutions, foundational research on repeated games, and dynamic models of political power, wealth, and status. The PI will develop a model of the foundations of enforcement institutions to compare the roles of private-order (eg decentralized) and public-order (eg, centralized) enforcement. Community enforcement models are a special case of repeated games with private monitoring; the PI plans to develop a new type of recursive characterization of (or bound on) equilibrium payoffs in games of this type. Finally, game theory results on coalition formation will be used along with public finance ideas on optimal fiscal policy without commitment to develop a new model of dynamic fiscal policy under political constraints."

By centering race as a factor agricultural and environmental politics, this project seeks to advance understanding of the relationship between rural inequality and environmental change. It asks how the racial politics of the plantation impacted early development of pesticides as an agricultural technology; how historic tensions between agricultural productivity and racial equity contributed to current structures of agro-environmental regulation; and how different narratives of agricultural change connected to race relations inform contemporary debates over the use and regulation of pesticides. Placing the dual objectives of racial equity and agricultural productivity at the center of inquiry, the project provides a policy-relevant analysis of the obstacles to and opportunities for greater environmental and social sustainability through agricultural practices.  Oral histories produced through this study will be archived, and made publically available, in order to expand public knowledge and inform future research.

Taken together, state migration policies, refugee laws, and international agreements constitute what is here termed the ""refugee regime"" - a set of institutional practices through which the migration policies of countries in the West and the Middle East have become increasingly interconnected. This research draws attention to (1) the transnational activities of state agencies, humanitarian organizations, and non-state actors in managing forced migration, and (2) forced migrants' experiences along their journeys. In doing so, this research re-situates the politics of migration management from a top-down disembodied conception to one informed by the everyday encounters, narratives, and struggles of forced migrants themselves. This research will make important contributions to the field of political geography and broader interdisciplinary debates in refugee studies, security and border studies, and feminist methodology. This study further seeks to interrogate popular representations of forced migrants as passive victims or burdens on the welfare state. Findings from this research will inform public debates about Syrian forced migrants through a series of public information workshops and policy briefs. Research findings will be disseminated to wider society in order to foster a better understanding of forced migrants' lives and the challenges that migrants' face.<br/>Findings from this research will also inform the co-PI's undergraduate teaching on international migration, transnationalism, and geography. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement Award, this project will provide support to enable a promising student to establish an independent research career.<br/><br/>This project responds to calls for studies on how migration management works across national borders and how migrants experience and negotiate their journeys between places of departure and arrival. It does so by answering two central research questions: 1) How is the refugee regime constituted across transnational space? 2) How do Syrian forced migrants experience the refugee regime across their migration trajectory and once they arrive in their final destination? In order to answer these questions this project comprises archival research, interviews, and participatory mapping with Syrian forced migrants, as well as interviews with staff of state and non-state institutions. Using these methods, this research contributes new findings to scholarship on the securitization of migration and the changing geographies of borders and migration management."

However, sewer overflows during wet weather flow are a widespread issue in the US. Sewer solids are a major contributor to pollution during urban wet weather flows. Therefore, sewers are not merely a conduit for wastewater, but rather, complex bioreactors: microorganisms can decay, grow, and have their transport attenuated during conveyance. Surprisingly little is known about the biological processes which occur the sewer deposits and their effect on the fate of microbial agents (i.e., pathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria) and that is the objective of this proposed project. <br/><br/>To perform Quantitative Microbial Risk Assessment for overflow events, optimize sewer maintenance plans, and design wet weather flow treatment, it is necessary to understand the processes affecting the survival of microbial agents (here defined as pathogens and antibiotic resistant bacteria) in sewer solids and biofilms. This is especially true in the case of sewer overflows, but is also important in order to use sewer samples for tracking the incidence of human disease. Sewer surveillance is a useful tool for epidemiology that would benefit from improved understanding of the fate of microbial agents during conveyance in sewer systems. A field survey will be performed to determine the biochemical factors driving the microbial quality of sewer deposits and the relative loading of microbial agents in wastewater and sewer deposits. Next, a controlled simulated sewer experiment will be performed to determine the fate of microbial agents in sewer deposits to provide kinetic data in sewer sediments and biofilm. Finally, a combined sewer overflow (CSO) event will be sampled to characterize the flux of the microbial agents during wet weather flow events. This field study will use the microbial signatures of sewer sediments developed to differentiate between the flux of microbial agents from sewer solids and wastewater. High-throughput, viability-based molecular assays will be applied in this study and allow for sensitive detection of pathogens and the determination of the dynamics of the viable and non-viable antibiotic resistance gene loads. This understanding is essential for determining the risk posed by antibiotic resistant genes in sewer sediments upon release in the environment. Overall, the proposed project will provide critical insight into the fate of microbial agents in sewers and during wet weather flow. The research approach extends biomolecular analytical methods for understanding the fate of microbial agents in sewer deposits. The quantitative data gathered on the environmental factors driving the proliferation of pathogen and antibiotic resistance in sewers will inform quantitative microbial risk assessment, improve models of wet weather pollution events, and aid in the development of mitigation strategies. Of particular interest is the potential application of the knowledge gained here on in-sewer biological processes for improved implementation of sewer surveillance for tracking infectious disease. Sewer epidemiological methods are currently limited by our lack of understanding of critical environmental factors and biochemical processes driving the fate of microbial agents in sewers. Therefore, this work has the potential to transform not only our ability to protect public health during wet weather flow, but also our ability to perform public health surveillance in the sewer matrix. The project targets: (1) recruiting and retaining undergraduate women students in engineering; and, (2) improving scientific literacy. Educational materials and learning modules will be developed and presented biannually in STEM outreach to Girl Scouts (grades 6-12) and at Rutgers Day. A project website will be created to improve public scientific literacy and broaden public knowledge of CSO issues."

It will integrate exciting new fossil discoveries as well as anatomical and new genomic data. A unique feature of the fossil record for these flies is that many diverse higher flies are preserved with life-like fidelity in fossilized resin (amber) that is from 17 to 130 million years old.  This profoundly enhances the accuracy with which the timing and amount of evolutionary change can be measured. With these data, this project can address whether higher flies are diverse because their speciation is so rapid, or because their extinction rate is low, or both.  It also can address whether higher flies were affected by mass extinctions that occurred  66 million years ago, when most dinosaurs became extinct, and whether the largest group of higher flies, which represents the largest radiation of all life in the past 66 million years, also are the fastest evolving. Besides these broad questions, this study will also address the rate of evolution of fruit flies (Drosophila), based on several hundred specimens in amber.  Since fruit flies are a model system for genetic and genomic research, this will provide a unique context for research in genomics and evolution. The project also will provide research training and experience for high school students and develop a museum exhibit on the evolution of flies.<br/> <br/>This project will construct a comprehensive evolutionary framework through the analysis, study, and interpretation of over 30 years of accumulated data on the phylogeny, biogeography, and general evolution of the ""higher"" flies (Brachyceran Diptera).  It will build upon the principal investigator's experience from hundreds dissections of exemplar living species, thousands of measurements and digital images of living and fossil species, and writing descriptions for over 70 fossil species to first assemble a data matrix of 592 morphological characters from 526 taxa, including both fossil and extant species. This morphological and molecular data will be used to compile a monograph on the morphology, fossil record, and phylogeny of the Brachycera, emphasizing the Mesozoic Era.  This project also will produce a detailed descriptive study on diverse new Drosophilidae preserved in amber (42-17 million years ago) and two papers that address divergence times of lineages in lower Brachycera and in the Ephydroidea, especially Drosophila, analyzed with morphological and genomic data.  Outreach will include mentoring high school student interns in the amber laboratory and developing a traveling or permanent exhibit at the American Museum of Natural History, ""Flies."""

Structural resistances for these structures can be estimated, enabling the estimation of tornado wind speeds associated with the damage.  This Rapid Response Research (RAPID) project will investigate tornado wind structure and estimated wind speeds through three-dimensional (3-D), digital data preservation of the tornado damage to the oilfield facility and irrigation system structures.   Preservation of this 3-D structural damage data will enable future researchers to validate wind-damage prediction models, via physical modeling, computer modeling, and other predictive damage modeling (for example, loss estimation and risk assessment modeling).   <br/><br/>Using a suite of remote-sensing data collection methods, the project team will rapidly collect high-resolution, 3-D structural damage data through photography and photogrammetry, laser scanning, unmanned aerial vehicle visual imaging, and satellite imaging.  The data collected from this project can serve as the basis for collaborative, multi-disciplinary studies emphasizing the accurate and highly detailed preservation of structural damage from tornadoes, heightened understanding of the complex wind structures of tornadoes, validation or refinement of tornado wind speed estimates, and development of more resilient infrastructure.  Undergraduate students will participate in data collection and then use this data to collaborate on future research alongside graduate students and faculty researchers from three institutions, thus training future leaders in the mitigation of natural hazards damage."

Manipulating plant hormones with chemical and genetic tools has been instrumental in the green revolution; a deeper understanding of how hormones control plant growth will likely fuel future advances in agriculture. In this project, biological sensors will be developed to detect a recently recognized plant hormone called strigolactone, and an unknown molecule in plants (KL) that controls seed germination, seedling growth, and leaf shape. The biological sensors will be used in this project to purify KL, which may be a novel hormone, and to identify genes that produce it. Discovery of KL may lead to the development of new agrichemicals or genetic modifications that promote uniform seed germination and seedling vigor, thus increasing crop yields. Strigolactone sensors will be useful tools for plant breeders to more easily develop crops with altered strigolactone levels, which can in turn influence the fertilizer requirements of crops and their susceptibility to weeds. Undergraduate students and a postdoctoral researcher will be trained in research skills and scientific communication, leading to enhancement of the scientific workforce. Research discoveries will be communicated to the public through journal publications, press releases, news articles, and local speaking opportunities.<br/><br/>Karrikins are compounds found in smoke that promote seed germination after fire and enhance seedling vigor. The karrikin signaling pathway is highly similar to the strigolactone signaling pathway, suggesting common ancestry. A receptor that is necessary for karrikin responses, KARRIKIN INSENSITIVE 2 (KAI2), has been identified, but karrikins are unlikely to be its native ligand. The aims of this project are to (1) develop sensitive and specific biological assays to detect the unknown KAI2 ligand (KL) and strigolactones, (2) identify genes involved in KL biosynthesis, and (3) highly purify KL from plant extracts as a steppingstone toward its identification. Biological sensors for karrikins/KL and strigolactones based on transcriptional or proteolytic responses will be engineered. These bioassays will be used in genetic screens to identify KL-deficient mutants. Finally, bioassay-guided fractionation will be used to isolate KL in small molecule extracts from plants. The discovery of KL and KL biosynthesis genes will catalyze a new field of research in plant biology that impacts the understanding of seed dormancy, seedling photomorphogenesis, and leaf development. It will also provide insights into the ancestral function of the KAI2 signaling mechanism in basal land plants, which later duplicated and evolved to mediate growth control by strigolactones."

Recycling and prevention of waste through reuse are key aspects of these policies, yet little is known about how these waste management measures are practiced, especially as goods for reuse are exported from one country to another. This dissertation focuses on the global value chain for used clothing to understand what happens to discarded items that are transformed from waste and diverted from landfill by being given value. Drawing from economic sociology and waste studies, this project seeks to provide an account of valuation of these waste flows. This dissertation will develop a theory of valuation that can account for cases in which goods are highly unstandardized. Existing sociological explanations of valuation cannot account for how value is created along the global value chain of used clothing, where goods are highly variable and supply is unpredictable. Understanding how waste is transformed into a commodity is important to countries seeking to develop waste management policies that are nationally and globally effective and sustainable. <br/><br/>This study is a multi-sited, mixed-methods study that traces the value chain of used clothing from the United Kingdom to Poland. The central empirical question asks how value is created along the global value chain of used clothing. This dissertation relies on a comparison of how used clothing market actors at different points along the global value chain of used clothing make decisions about value and waste. Data will include in-depth, semi-structured interviews with actors involved in the collection, sorting, processing, exporting, importing, or selling of used clothing in the UK and Poland. Interviews will be informed and supplemented by observation and participant observation in sites at each of six analytically-identified stages along the value chain of used clothing between the UK and Poland. Field notes, interview transcripts, and photographs will be qualitatively coded. Quantitative data regarding amounts and percentages of clothing sold/discarded will come from a structured component of interviews and supplemented by existing industry data. These data, as well as existing business register data, will be analyzed using tabular and multivariate analysis to help explain variations found in the qualitative data and to assess the generalizability of the qualitative findings. This research contributes both to economic sociology and to recycling and waste policy."

The research will also attempt to explain why 29 states relaxed firearms restrictions, while 16 states tightened restrictions in the two years that followed the shooting. This study employs two methods of analysis. First, to determine how the gun control and gun rights movements responded to the event, the Co-PI compares two different  cases to assess how and if two major national gun control organizations and two major national gun rights organizations changed their policy agendas, targets,tactics, and organizational structures between 2011 and 2014. Second, the co-PI uses qualitative comparative analysis to show why some states strengthened firearms restrictions while others relaxed restrictions during the 2011-2012 and the 2013-2014 legislative sessions. The findings of this study will be useful to scholars who study social movements, public health, state-level policy change, and professional political organizations. In addition, this study will contribute to public knowledge and discourse about social movements in America.<br/><br/>This dissertation contributes to the academic literatures on social movement strategy and on policy outcomes by explaining how movement organizations respond to critical events and why laws sometimes change during the political debate that follows them. There is agreement in the literature that critical events are important for social movements. Little is known, however, about how opposing movement organizations change in response to such events, or how these responses are mediated by other features of the political context and by each organization?s own internal constraints. Similarly, scholars have established that critical events can shake up the political agenda and facilitate policy change. But we still know little about the conditions that facilitate policy change after such events, or whether these conditions are distinct from those that fostered similar policy changes before the event occurred. The Co-PI will conduct intensive case studies of two important gun control organizations and two important gun rights organizations about their organizational structures, targets, tactics, and political agendas between 2011 and 2014. To answer the second question, she will conduct fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to determine what factors led to changes in state-level firearms restrictions in the legislative sessions before and after the shooting. The researcher will compare the conditions that led to four different state-level policy outcomes.  This dissertation has two objectives: 1) to detail how political organizations respond to critical events; and 2) to determine the conditions under which state laws change after such events. The findings of this study will be useful to scholars who study social movements, public health, state-level policy change, and professional political organizations.

The Division of Undergraduate Education has created several grant opportunities to support institutional transformation in STEM instruction by providing institutional grants under the WIDER program during 2012 and 2013 and thereafter in the IUSE: EHR program in the Institutional and Community Transformation track. (WIDER stood for Widening the Implementation and Demonstration of Evidence-Based Reforms. IUSE: EHR stands for Improving Undergraduate STEM Education in the EHR Directorate.)  This conference will assemble Principal Investigators and co-Principal Investigators on projects supported by those two programs, as well as allied NSF programs under the NSF-wide IUSE framework, e.g. IUSE: GEOPATHS, IUSE: RED, and IUSE: POLAR. To save transportation costs, it will piggyback on a national meeting of NSF grant recipients in an array of the aforementioned programs past and present.  This meeting is scheduled for the spring, 2016. Following NSF's 4-year focus on transforming institutions through grants in order to overcome intra-institutional barriers to adopting research-based instructional strategies, there is now a substantial number of institutions engaged in spreading the use of evidence-based teaching approaches and associated efforts in assessment and evaluation. Each institution is engaged in a partly unique set of activities to increase and support the spread of research-based practices. The structure of the conference is designed to determine how different approaches are working in different institutional contexts in order to identify those that are robust to institutional setting and those that are more idiosyncratic to the host institution. In a single institution there is a tendency for the research team in each institution to be heavily influenced by the idiosyncrasies of their institution. By connecting across institutions, teams will be able to develop a broader perspective on the effectiveness of various strategies that can be deployed in service of the main goal of spreading effective teaching practices across the instructional faculty.  <br/><br/>The primary purpose of this project is to conduct a research integration study of the preliminary findings of the projects supported by WIDER and IUSE: EHR. This integration study will provide a venue for research teams to compare results and share their understandings of what is working. The conference will lead to three outcomes: identification of successful strategies across a variety of institutional contexts, a synthesis of findings, and a network of sponsored projects for further follow-up. This conference will use the experience and expertise of the Principal Investigators through research integration by dialogue, using the approaches of a consensus conference and a consensus development panel through use of break-out sessions.  A 7-step meta-ethnographic approach will be used."

This is done with the design and implementation of novel and modular radio frequency (RF) interface circuit which is powered from the existing power electronics control circuitry of ECM in motor housing without impeding upon its performance. The novel RF circuit can be interfaced with the existing ECM systems or integrated during the manufacturing process. The accuracy of the communication is enhanced by using the reciprocal frequency counter method.  This technology makes conventional ECM a ""smart"" ECM and gives them wireless communication capability with smart phones which have android or IOS software platforms.

Currently, physical therapists, athletic trainers and strength and conditioning coaches only have very blunt tools to assess each individual?s strength and very limited information about the optimal muscle profile. Therefore, training and rehabilitative approaches are developed via experience and trial and error. The technology proposed here solves these problems by making using of an image-to-model pipeline to quantify muscle size and provide valuable and actionable information based on the quantification. However, the obstacles for a wide adoption of this technology include specific magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) protocols and lengthy image segmentation process. In the previous funding cycle these two problems have been addressed with substantial technology advancements. The proposed activities in this funding cycle will continue the technical development process to further bring down the cost with improved image segmentation process and provide additional value with advanced data analysis. It will ultimately be a revolutionary tool to improve muscle health."

The relevance and importance of ML is not limited to specialized technological innovations, as it was in the past. Nowadays, it also increasingly influences everyday life through its contributions to applications such as voice/face recognition, credit fraud detection, intelligent recommendation systems and many others. Furthermore, ML is inherently multi-disciplinary as it draws from advances in multiple disciplines such as engineering, computing, statistics, mathematics, physics and biology, to name a few major ones. Since its start in 2009, AMALTHEA, one of the first ML-focused REU sites, involves 10 undergraduate students per year from a broad spectrum of disciplines, and the educational experience spans 10 weeks in the summer. The participants are exposed to cutting-edge ML research, as well as professional development activities, such as technical seminars and career-related workshops. Moreover, these participants perform closely-mentored research, whose results are going to impact the field of ML itself, as well as how ML is applied in other scientific disciplines. Over the 2016-2019 time span, the project will directly impact a diverse group of 30 motivated students, the majority of which may not have access to such research participation opportunities otherwise.<br/><br/>The project's thrust area is the theory of ML and how it can be integrated and applied to important real-life problems, hence exposing participants to both theory and applications. Past projects include applications such as automated anuran recognition from frog calls, uncovering criminal networks from crime locations, human-object interaction recognition, modelling of group dynamics in virtual worlds, speaker-independent speech recognition and license plate recognition among others. On the other hand, past contributions to the theory of ML have been steered towards topics such as functional data analysis, wavelet-based density estimation, non-linear dimensionality reduction, kernel methods and anomaly detection to name a few. Short video highlights of such projects can be found on AMALTHEA's YouTube channel located at https://goo.gl/2JhYoF.

The treatment and disposal of high-strength organic wastes involves high capital and operating cost expenditures. This project focuses on the valorization of biomass wastes to useful chemicals using a novel low pH microbial fermentation process that affords efficient extraction of the products. The extracted products will provide low-cost biodegradable deicers for applications on roads, highways, and airports for snow and ice control. This benefits include avoidance of waste treatment costs, the generation of value-added products, and the elimination of water and soil pollution from currently used chloride deicers.<br/><br/>Considerable amount of energy and resources are expended in aerobic and anaerobic treatment of wastes at present. The only chemical that is currently produced at large scale from organic wastes is methane gas, a low-value commodity chemical that is in excess supply. It is produced by anaerobic process that is costly and complex to operate. This project is aimed at developing a two-stage fermentation process for the conversion of biomass wastes to calcium magnesium acetate and propylene glycol. The EAGER project will develop microbial growth kinetics data and continuous immobilized cell fermentation data for the conversion lactic acid to acetic acid at low pH values where product extraction is most efficient. Novel porous supports will be used for cell immobilization. Extraction studies will be conducted at low pH values for acetic acid extraction. This project will develop new knowledge in the area of low pH bioconversion, advance knowledge in the area of immobilized cell fermentation, and advance knowledge in the area of acid extraction from fermentation liquor at low pH values. This project is transformative as it can engender research into the valorization of many different organic wastes and biomass to useful products. This project will have significant social, economic, and environmental impacts. The proposed project will enable the generation of high-value chemicals that will provide economic benefits to society. The capital and operating costs associated with the treatment of oxygen-demanding wastes will be eliminated. Moreover, the biodegradable deicers that are produced will replace non-biodegradable deicers such as sodium and calcium chlorides that are currently used for road and airport runway deicing. Large-scale application of inorganic salts to deice roads and highways has caused sodium and chloride contamination of surface waters, ground waters, and soils. Society will benefit from the health and aesthetic advantages associated with a cleaner environment and a healthy ecosystem from the use of biodegradable deicers. In addition, these new deicer products will prevent costs associated with automobile corrosion and costs related to rehabilitation of buildings and civil infrastructure that are damaged by application of conventional deicing chloride salts."

Social scientists do not have a clear understanding of how these institutions relate to one another within an internal economy of homeless management and how these relationships shape the survival of the houseless. Further, every city in the United has an insufficient supply of shelter beds and homeless housing units. There is, then, an important empirical puzzle as to how, why, and when, in this context of housing scarcity, certain individuals and groups end up in one institution rather than another. Rather than just view homelessness as an outcome of poverty, this dissertation seeks to explain the role institutions of homeless management play in sorting and stratifying the poor and possibly deepening the poverty of the precariously housed through policy toward the homeless. This dissertation research will integrate several fields of study in sociology, social welfare and public health and help understand the ways in which policy affects marginalized groups.<br/><br/>To answer the empirical puzzle of who gets what and when within a homeless services system, the dissertation will provide a comparative study of the streets, shelters, and permanent supportive housing programs in the city of San Francisco; a city considered a national model for its multi-service shelters and ""housing first"" approach. The study will adjudicate among three common explanations of institutional entry, restriction, and preference: (a) institutional factors (b) discretionary factors and (c) individual factors that affect their entry, exit, restriction, and circulation between street, shelter, and homeless housing.  The dissertation will also assess how residing within one institution or another affects health, work, welfare, criminalization, and social ties. These processes will be studied through a ""multi-sided ethnography,"" working alongside social workers on the streets, shelters, and permanent supportive housing on the one hand, and navigating alongside homeless people through these same spaces.  This  research contributes to the sociology of the homeless, social welfare, sociology of poverty and has strong broader impacts in its potential contribution to homeless and housing policy."

There is yet insufficient capability to predict the observed complex transport behaviors of these particles under environmental conditions.  Consequently, the theory to support optimized design of the above environmental systems is lacking.  Mathematical models currently can describe but not predict these behaviors because, as yet, the models do not represent the underlying mechanisms and processes for particle attachment to surfaces under environmental conditions.  The proposed research aims to determine whether observed complex colloid transport behaviors will emerge from pore-scale representation of the surface heterogeneity responsible for particle attachment.  The proposed investigations involve parallel experiments and simulations at pore (micromodel) and network (packed sand column) scales.  The research will provide for a transformative platform for researchers and practitioners to perform mechanistic prediction of particle transport for design of solutions to environmental problems.  Additional broader impacts include engagement of middle and high school biology, chemistry, and earth science teachers in six-week long summer internships where they undertake field and laboratory experiences examining the role of particles in trace element transport and transformation.<br/><br/>The capability to predict the observed complex transport behaviors of colloids under environmental conditions (e.g., non log-linear profiles of retained colloids, extended tailing of low concentrations, blocking, and ripening) is currently lacking.  Empirically based continuum-scale rate constants and scaling factors are employed in the advection-dispersion equation to describe, and to a limited extent predict, the observed complex transport behaviors.  Whereas these descriptions are extremely useful indicators of mechanisms, true predictive capability will be possible only if the underlying physicochemical mechanisms/processes are identified and parameterized at a more fundamental level.  Pore scale (nanoscale) colloid-surface interactions are well-demonstrated to exert profound influences on colloid transport behaviors at the continuum scale (column and field).  This research aims to determine whether the continuum-scale rate constants and scaling factors can be predicted, and the whether the observed complex continuum-scale behavior will emerge, from pore-scale representation of surface heterogeneity and network-scale representation of packing structure.  This investigation involves parallel experiments and simulations at pore (micromodel) and continuum (column) scales.  Coupled pore scale force/torque balance simulations will be conducted to pore/grain network simulations in order to develop mechanistic prediction of continuum scale rate constants and scaling factors.  New approaches will be used to represent surface heterogeneity responsible for colloid attachment to bulk repulsive surfaces at the pore scale.  The proposed research will also capitalize on, and extend, recent understanding of influences of topology at the continuum (network) scale where the transition between molecular (diffusion-driven) and particle (trajectory-driven) transport behaviors will be explored."

Our revolutionary moisture management technology utilizes a novel 3D microfluidic transport principle to move sweat from the skin to the outside of clothing, where it can drip away or be controlled. Compared with conventional moisture wicking products which are based on capillary absorption, our technology allows fabric and apparel products to remain lightweight, always dry, highly breathable and never-saturated.

Our proposed research aims to develop a broad range of textiles that can continuously transport moisture, so that fabric remain dry, breathable and lightweight during high intensity physical activities in hot and humid environment. Utilizing the large-scale manufacturing process developed in Phase I, ongoing research efforts will focus on the implementation of the technology on a broad range of fabric materials (e.g. polyester/polyurethane blends, cotton). As well, scientists at ATACAMA will optimize designs of the fluidic channels based on body sweat mapping research and will further enhance the robustness of the fluidic network.

The stress released during an earthquake (called the stress drop) controls the ground accelerations produced by the earthquake waves, and hence the damage potential. The stress drop is also fundamental to understanding and modeling the physics of the earthquake source, because it defines the energy budget. It is important to know whether stress drop varies from region to region, and with earthquake magnitude. This is because earthquake parameters and ground shaking measurements in regions of high seismicity are often used to estimate hazard in other regions that may have lower historic seismicity rate, for example regions with induced seismicity. However it is currently unknown how much stress drop really varies between earthquakes. The observed variability ranges over a factor of 100 to 1000, which poses significant challenges in interpreting stress drop results. It is often not clear how much of the variability comes from measurement uncertainties, and how much represents real regional variations in fault properties. The investigators will focus on the section of the San Andreas Fault near Parkfield, in central California, where there is a high rate of earthquakes, including distinct sequences of small repeating earthquakes, and the fault also creeps slowly. It is one of the best-instrumented sections of fault in the world. The award will aid the development of a new geophysics group at the University of Oklahoma by supporting a beginning-career female PI, and a graduate student. The student will have the opportunity to be an active participant in the research communities in both Boston and Oklahoma. The research activities will help to establish earthquake research in Oklahoma, a state with increased awareness of earthquake hazard due to dramatic increase in seismicity, and will be integrated into classroom activities.<br/><br/>The large number of earthquakes and the long-term dense networks of seismometers make this region a natural laboratory for understanding earthquake source physics. The multiple-scale dense observational networks provide on-scale recordings for a wide magnitude range; the existing detailed research provides a well-defined context in which to interpret the results. The Investigators propose to apply multi-scale (both large- and small-scale) analysis methods to the dense dataset of earthquake waveforms aimed at resolving the continuing controversy regarding earthquake scaling and variability. The investigators will calculate the stress release for a large number of earthquakes in multiple ways, using different subsets of the data. The work will focus on three distinct questions: (1) Is the apparent scaling of stress drop an artifact of poor data with limited bandwidth, limited magnitude range, and inadequate correction for site and propagation effects? (2) Do the stress drops of repeating earthquakes at Parkfield change with time as a result of the change in strain rate from the 2004 M6 Parkfield earthquake? (3) What data quality and analysis requirements are needed to confirm that spatial and temporal variations observed here and in future studies are real? The proposed research will increase understanding of the earthquake source process, both at Parkfield, and beyond. The methods developed, and the greater understanding of their limitations and constraints should enable a higher resolution of earthquake source parameters, and hence seismic hazard maps, worldwide."

FogKicker is made from nanocellulose, a natural nanomaterial that can be extracted from waste paper, wood, or plants. Nanocellulose is an extremely hydrophilic material, which readily and efficiently absorbs water. To make FogKicker, nanocellulose is added to a dilute aqueous solution, which allows the solution to be applied to a variety of surfaces. When FogKicker dries, it creates a hydrophilic coating on the surface it is applied to. This hydrophilic coating absorbs moisture, preventing fog from condensing where the coating is applied; this is how FogKicker prevents the formation of fog on any surface. To formulate the FogKicker solution, the team has also developed a novel process for the extraction of nanocellulose, which has broad applications in automotive, aerospace, packaging, and construction.

Moreover, this research examines the interactions between national and subnational institutions as they relate to enforcement of pollution regulation.  This project examines how two major institutions have created divergent incentives structures for local bureaucrats that produce the following research questions: 1) Does the fact that budget-poor bureaucrats are dependent on polluting firms make budget-poor bureaucrats more likely to defy the central authority and protect polluters than their budget-rich counterparts?; 2)Do state ownership of firms make it easier for local officials to obtain compliance from certain polluters? By highlighting the impact of state institutions on bureaucratic behavior, this project draws attention to under-explored structural explanations for why government agents systematically defy-or obey-government leaders. It also examines the tools and strategies authoritarian leaders use to confront emerging governance crisis. <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>This research project explains how authoritarian countries enforce pollution regulation. Moreover, this research examines the interactions between national and subnational institutions as they relate to enforcement of pollution regulation. Using China as the case of interest, this project draws on case study research and statistical analysis to ascertain when officials in China's 283 prefecture-level cities choose to punish-or protect-polluters. The quantitative component uses two original datasets to test for key variables associated with weak enforcement of pollution regulation in China:  First, using NASA satellite data, the PI compiles a database on the level of pollution violations in 283 cities. Second, to assess how firm ownership affects pollution enforcement, the PI compiles data on individual firm characteristics of all major polluting firms in the 283 cities. The PI  project then uses interview research with regulators (local officials) and the regulated (polluting firms) to explain the patterns revealed by quantitative data. Interviews are conducted in two regions of China with contrasting records on pollution to understand how incentives to enforce pollution regulation may vary in these two regions. The PI focuses on the motivations of individual officials and factory owners. This study provides important understanding on the incentive structure that regulates administrative behavior in authoritarian regimes."

The balance between uptake and release of these quantities influences both the Arctic region and the global climate system.  The terrestrial cycling of carbon, water, and energy are strongly linked, and therefore need to be studied at the same time and in the same place. This project continues long-term measurements of carbon, water, and energy balance in terrestrial and freshwater systems in the Alaskan Arctic, extending measurements that began in 2007.  Carbon loss over the winter has recently increased dramatically at one of our study sites, as winter air and soil temperatures have warmed. This study will determine whether these losses continue and seek to understand the underlying causes. Broader impacts of this project include contributions to teaching and learning, including underrepresented groups, support of undergraduate summer research, participation in the Marine Biology Laboratory Logan Science Journalism program and the Arctic LTER Schoolyard program, and outreach to K-12 schools in Fairbanks, Alaska, and to Native Alaskan communities. This project will support career development of two female Principal Investigators at UAF.<br/><br/>The proposed research will extend continuous measurements of carbon, water, and energy balance in three tundra ecosystems near Imnavait Creek, Alaska. Ecosystem/atmosphere flux measurements have been collected at these sites via eddy covariance since 2007. Long-term monitoring of hydrology and stream chemistry of Imnavait Creek and depth of thaw in its catchment area will be maintained. Additional measurements to help interpret these data will include water table depth, plant community composition, and vegetation greenness via reflectivity, which is related to leaf area and biomass. Long-term measurements of stream chemistry and discharge are available at Imnavait, enabling comprehensive assessment of carbon budgets.  All data will be made publicly available and archived at the Arctic Long-Term Ecological Research (LTER) web site, the International Arctic Research Center Data Archive, and the Advanced Cooperative Arctic Data and Information Service (ACADIS).<br/>"

This large-scale database will contain information on products and services directly offered by public and private firms to their customers over the last 20 years, as well as links to the US Patent and Trademark Office's patent data for the last 20 years. The resulting database and analysis tool will enable researchers to answer many questions, including: How do industries, competition in industries and their products change over time? What are the dynamics of product introduction rates for private and public firms and how did private firms and their array of product offerings change during the recent financial crisis? What products are introduced by public and private firms following increases in patenting activity within an industry? Do the patenting firms introduce the new products or do non-patenting firms? Which government policy changes were most effective in stimulating the growth of entrepreneurial firms, and in what kind of markets did these policies work best? What local product market conditions are most conducive to successful entry by entrepreneurial firms and how do waves of innovation impact product market competition? What economic forces trigger firms to cross the boundary between public and private status? In addition to impacting academics that study innovation and how industries change over time, business decision makers, consumers, and regulators will benefit from the new industry designations. Businesses can use the database and web based tool to assess existing market structure around new products. This will facilitate more informed decisions about where and when to commit scarce resources to enter new markets. By examining the nature of existing competition and market structure by both public and private firms, large and small, entrepreneurs can also better assess the likely success of their new ventures. Regulators including the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Department of Justice (DOJ) can also benefit from refined knowledge of industry structure and product market boundaries. <br/><br/>This project will produce a highly scalable approach for mining historical Web data to create comprehensive product-based databases and tools to query and analyze this data. This integrated database will be built using firm web pages from the Internet Archive Wayback Machine project. Using the text from these web pages, the resulting database will classify firms as competitors, which will be used to build new industry definitions. These new industry definitions will be based directly on the product and service descriptions firms use to interface with customers. The project will produce a publicly available web-based analytical tool based on ""Elasticsearch"" (www.elasticsearch.com). This tool will allow users to query the database of public and private firms, their competitors, and the products they offer. Using this tool, a user will be able to input a company, or list of companies, and the tool will provide that company's product descriptions and a list of its competitors that produce similar products, along with the corresponding similarity scores, indicating the strength of competitive links. The analytical tool will also allow a firm's local product market to be visualized as a network. In addition to the hosted, online search tool, users will be able to download bulk datasets to perform their own local processing."

It examines how environmental conditions interact with socio-political factors and development policy to influence the production of the world's most valuable seafood commodity. Shrimp diseases result in dramatic economic losses in regions reliant on aquaculture and create high market volatility in regions that primarily fish for wild shrimp, such as the United States. A better understanding of the socio-political and environmental conditions that drive the problem of disease will strengthen the food production economies of both types of regions, particularly for small-scale producers who are disproportionately affected by disease outbreaks. The project incorporates environmental and contextual factors into commodities research, which has traditionally focused on the role of firms in explaining how commodities like shrimp are produced. The focus on shrimp disease is expected to help improve disease remediation management for shrimp farmers as well as assist the identification and dissemination of effective responses to market volatility for U.S. producers. <br/><br/>Shrimp are produced in two distinct ways: (a) aquaculture (farming) in land-based ponds and (b) traditional wild-capture methods. Most consumers in the global marketplace do not differentiate shrimp produced by these two methods. As a result, the growth of aquaculture has dramatically increased supply and caused a fall in global prices for producers using both methods. This growth has been accompanied by the emergence of diseases in shrimp farms, which have caused significant economic loss and dramatic price volatility in the global market. Despite decades of research, treatment of most major diseases remains difficult or impossible. The problem is especially severe for many small-scale producers in both the U.S. and Asia, who are impacted by the general fall in prices and lack the knowledge or resources to effectively respond to disease losses or market volatility. This project addresses these issues by asking what structural and socioeconomic drivers lead to the emergence of disease in certain areas, how disease impacts producers at local levels, and how small-scale producers adapt and respond to disease. The research methods combine analysis of contextual historical and economic data with interviews with shrimp producers and local traders in field sites in North Carolina and Aceh, Indonesia. This approach addresses the ""black box"" problem of commodities research, in which the consumer side of commodity exchanges are well understood, but the social and environmental conditions of production at the local level are not. Interviews draw on the investigator's connections with producer groups in both regions to better understand production relationships, livelihood strategies, and policy impacts, with an emphasis on how they shape and are shaped by the emergence of disease."

Changes include the restructuring of food systems so that local farming economies are increasingly tied to global networks and processes. One somewhat surprising response on the part of local food producers has been the rise of binational family-based farming enterprises, which, despite being small to midscale ventures, successfully coordinate across state lines to facilitate vertically integrated operations, mitigate inequities, and access produce markets.  The research supported by this award will investigate how this occurs: how do local family fruit and vegetable producers utilize global networks, coordinate transregional projects, and contribute to food system circulations? And what role do traditional modes of organizing family farms, such as kinship networks, play in contemporary farming operations? The research will be carried out by University of Kentucky doctoral student Mary Elizabeth W. Schmid, with direction from anthropologist Dr. Ann E. Kingsolver, in the western North Carolina region of southern Appalachia, with comparative research in other southeastern U.S. states and Mexico. <br/><br/>Schmid will document family and enterprise histories, provisioning strategies, forms of relatedness, cultural practices, and decision-making processes to determine how members draw on family and non-family relations to enable strategic production, distribution, and marketing coordination across time and space. Her mixed methods approach will include archival research, participant observation, interviewing, social network analysis, ethnographic mapping, and qualitative analysis of textual data. She will map family and enterprise networks, temporal cycles, transnational kinship circuit flows, and the social organization of fruit and vegetable production and marketing. Findings from this research will contribute to understanding the functioning of small to midscale fruit and vegetable production enterprises in the contemporary economy and the social and economic effects of agricultural policies intended to regulate this sector."

Despite this importance, however, entrepreneurship research has only recently expanded beyond studying precursor conditions (such as entrepreneurial personality traits and untapped market opportunities) to address the process of starting a business--developing a business model, incorporating, registering intellectual property, making first hires, and so on.  The present project seeks to map the field of start-up activities and to identify the common pathways that nascent entrepreneurial ventures follow in transiting that field.  The PI hypothesizes (a) that start-up trajectories cluster into distinct archetypes; (b) that the choice of archetype depends on identifiable attributes of the founding team, the new firm, and the social context; and (c) that different start-up sequences will yield different outcomes, depending on these team, firm, and context contingencies.  If confirmed, these predictions would represent a significant advance over current ""one size fits all"" models of the start-up process. Such a shift would have a transformative impact on science, teaching, practice and policy in the field of entrepreneurship.<br/><br/>This project advances the entrepreneurship literature's recent turn toward ""process studies"" that explore the contingent, unfolding nature of new firm emergence.  Applying a set of under-utilized statistical techniques to data on the timing of 36 start-up activities recorded by the Panel Study of Entrepreneurial Dynamics (PSED I and II), the investigation seeks to identify temporal patterns in the early trajectories of nascent entrepreneurial ventures.  First, the project will adapt multi-dimensional scaling (MDS) techniques from psychometry to map the set of start-up activities onto a multi-dimensional activity space, based on various measures of the activities' temporal similarity to one another.  Second, the project will adapt sequence analysis (SA) techniques from genomics to cluster the observed start-up sequences into a limited number of archetypal trajectories through the activity space.  Third, the project will assess the impact of exogenous conditions such as founder attributes, organization type, and environmental context in determining a new venture's particular trajectory.  Fourth, the project will evaluate the interactive impact of these exogenous contingencies and archetypal trajectories in shaping the new venture's survival and performance outcomes.  In furtherance of these analyses, the project will refine MDS and SA methodologies to better accommodate the unique features of social-scientific data such as the activity sequences in the PSED.  The project will also supplement the existing PSED data sets with new measures of socio-political and economic conditions in respondents' environments. These new methods and variables will enhance the PSED's usefulness as a data infrastructure for exploring social vs. economic, local vs. global, and objective vs. subjective environmental influences on the start-up process, both for the current investigation and for other investigations in years to come."

The REU project also will provide students an opportunity to collaborate with their faculty mentors and student peers across the nation after the summer program. <br/><br/>The sample research projects cover open research topics in software testing and analytics. Software Testing and Analysis of Scientific Software is to investigate the technique for adequately testing complex scientific software systems. The experimental data generated from the testing will be analyzed with machine learning tools for improving the test efficiency and effectiveness. We expect students will master basic principles of software testing and become skillful in creating test strategies and using tools for testing scientific software. Fault Detection Effectiveness and MC/DC Coverage of Combinatorial Test Cases will investigate the integration of combinatorial testing and MC/DC (modified condition/decision coverage) testing. Studies such as how logical expressions can be effectively tested, sensitivity analysis of different partitions of the input domain and factors that may affect combinatorial-based test generation, and a cross comparison between tests generated using different combinatorial testing algorithms will be conducted. Students will receive rigorous training in software testing and software testing research in this project. Software Analytics for Mobile Domain Specific Language (DSL) Construction will analyze program analysis results for the improvement of the development of DSL, and Guided Test Generation for Web Applications will use program analysis results to derive tests for testing web applications.

The research will provide new insights into interpretations of pollen from lake sediment cores that reveal changes in vegetation over time and contribute important information about interannual variation in pollen productivity and composition of a natural grassland environment.  Although conducted in a contemporary context, the project will help answer important questions in paleoecological research by helping quantify the relationships between pollen (as a vegetation proxy) and key drivers like fire, herbivory, and topography.  The project will enhance the value of a long-term dataset that is the longest-running annual record of North American grassland pollen composition.  The doctoral student will work with a high school serving underrepresented populations to integrate a research-based module into their science curriculum.  In addition, the project also will yield new information and insights to more effectively refine allergy assessments in the health and medical fields.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>North American grasslands emerged about 25 million years ago and have persisted despite dramatic changes in climate and fauna.  Over time, and especially throughout the Holocene Epoch, the species composition and the extent of the biome has changed, but the role of the biotic and abiotic factors influencing those changes remain unknown.  The doctoral student will conduct this project in a tallgrass prairie in Kansas.  The study area is diverse, with variable topography, and includes sites that have experienced a range of different burning and grazing treatments.  The research will focus on quantifying the relationships between grassland pollen assemblages and the biotic and abiotic variables influencing the region.  This will be accomplished by identifying pollen from multiple traps throughout the study to produce a multi-year set of modern pollen data.  The doctoral student will quantify these data in order to assess interannual variations in grassland pollen through multivariate statistical analyses.  Outcomes from this research will enable better interpretation of past vegetation cover and facilitate better predictions of grassland response to human-induced shifts in fire and herbivory regimes during a range of current and possible future climatic conditions."

Frozen water is present in the atmosphere -- in clouds -- where foreign particles such as mineral dust promote ice nucleation. Consequently, surface-assisted ice nucleation, i.e. heterogeneous ice nucleation, has a significant effect on cloud microphysics. This implies that it is important to accurately describe heterogeneous ice nucleation in order to be able to accurately model the weather and climate. Though theoretical and empirical descriptions have been developed, there is still no complete description of the requirements of the heterogeneous ice nucleation process, and no framework to know a priori if a given surface will be a good ice nucleating agent.<br/><br/>Through the synergistic experimental and simulation efforts, the foundation for molecular level understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation will be built. The focus of this research will be to relate the effects of surface charge and lattice match to heterogeneous nucleation of ice with an emphasis on the free energy of formation and the nucleation rate. Straightforward molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will provide detailed insights into water behavior near mica surfaces and will be compared with experimental findings. In addition, the kinetics and thermodynamics of ice nucleation will be calculated from simulations. The research will provide the basis for building predictive models of heterogeneous ice nucleation that can be incorporated into larger scale models relevant to atmospheric chemistry and weather prediction.<br/><br/>The simulation tools developed and results of this research will provide the basis to answer several of the top 10 questions related to molecular behavior of frozen water as listed by Bartels-Rausch (Nature, 2013), which are essential for predicting the future of our planet. Phase transitions assisted by surfaces in aqueous systems are relevant to a wide variety of fields and processes including biological assemblies, surfactants, nanotoxicology, semiconductor industry, food industry and others. Also, the research presents several learning opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in different forms. The collaborative nature of this research and the exchange program between the two scientist groups will expose the students to a multitude of tools used to study challenging problems in atmospheric chemistry.<br/><br/>The simulations will be used to develop informative videos to be used as educational tools as well as for recruitment of students into science and engineering. User-friendly modules that enable students to perform some simple molecular simulations, which can be used as supplements for class lectures to illustrate concepts in thermodynamics, kinetics and materials will be developed. These will be available to the scientific community free-of-charge. The results from the research will be published in peer-reviewed journals and will be presented in various national and international meetings."

While archaeologists have been able to find campsites that date to more than 13,000 years ago in the United States, we know very little about how the first people who inhabited North America lived. Shawnee-Minisink in Pennsylvania is one the oldest and best preserved archaeological sites in North America. This site allows us to examine early American social interaction and ways of life, which are rarely available at other sites of the same age. Data on the spatial distribution of artifacts from this site will be used to develop theoretical and methodological models to help better interpret other hunter-gatherer sites throughout the world. Information from this work, which places the site into a broader thematic context, will be used to nominate the site as a National Historic Landmark. The site currently listed on the National Register of Historic Places. The project also has pedagogical focus in training students and providing undergraduates with research experiences through the Smithsonian?s internship program.<br/><br/>These goals will be achieved through a detailed spatial analysis and refit study of 18,000 mapped artifacts. Ethnographic research has demonstrated the utility of using spatial data to examine hunter-gatherer behavior and social interactions. This research will examine: 1) site structure and organization through the spatial clustering of artifacts, 2) the function of specific work areas through artifact use-wear and the study of manufacturing debris from stone tool production, 3) intra-site social interaction by linking individual spatial units through the refitting of  artifacts and reduction debris, and 4) extra-site social interaction based on the distribution of exotic raw materials, links between work areas, and the spacing artifact clusters. This study is significant because few first American sites have been the focus of a detailed intra-site spatial study. As ethnographers have observed few highly mobile hunter-gatherer groups using stone tools and living on sparsely populated landscapes at middle latitudes, this project provides an opportunity to examine a prehistoric hunter-gatherer site at a large spatial scale and test relationships between the archaeological and ethnoarchaeological records. Lithic refitting patterns, isolated work areas, and overall spatial patterning will provide new insights into the way human behavior manifests itself through discarded artifacts. In this respect, this research provides a valuable dataset from which future comparative studies of social organization can be drawn to examine past human behavior.  Archaeological spatial data compiled and analyzed during this project will be accessible online through the Smithsonian Institution."

Iñupiaq people of the northwest Alaskan coast today rely on marine mammal hunting for a large portion of their subsistence as they have for millennia, but it is uncertain how observed and expected changes in the marine ecosystem might affect future food security. Archaeology is uniquely situated to provide perspective on this problem because it can consider human activity over long periods of time, and investigate how past changes affected marine mammals and their human hunters. This research will examine if and how environmental variability in the Arctic over the past 2,000 years affected marine mammals that in turn influenced human hunting patterns. This project will compare evidence for changes in marine conditions and their timing to variation in human diet based on the remains of animal bones from archaeological sites. This research will also contribute long-term baseline data enabling broader understanding of marine ecological dynamics in the Arctic. Results of the study will be incorporated into National Park Service public media and curriculum that is shared with northwest Alaska schools. <br/><br/>Hunter-gatherers generally focus on capturing resources that provide the highest energy return compared to energy expended. The diet of northwest Alaskan peoples has varied over the past two millennia, but it is unclear if these shifts are in any way linked to the health of marine mammals, on which contemporary communities rely. It is expected that variations in marine mammal health, brought about by changes in the marine environment, should drive these shifts. To evaluate this claim, the co-PI will identify and tally animal remains to asses changes in human diet over the study period. The marine environment will be reconstructed by measuring isotopes of carbon and nitrogen present in archaeological marine mammal bones throughout the same period. The analysis is complemented by an existing radiocarbon chronology that will be augmented where needed to ensure tight control over the ages of analyzed samples. By comparing the timing of changes in human dietary preference to changes in the marine environment, this study will assess the influence of marine health on the diets of coastal Alaskans. Results of this research will provide time-depth and broader context to studies of current environmental changes and their impact on communities reliant on marine mammal hunting."

Aufeis are massive accumulations of ice common to many arctic rivers, particularly in northeastern Siberia and the North Slope of Alaska. River aufeis form during freeze-up when thickening surface ice and permafrost restrict river discharge, causing water to overflow existing ice. Successive cycles of overflowing and freezing of water from upstream groundwater sources accumulate enormous quantities of ice, with late-winter aufeis on some rivers attaining thicknesses of 3 to 5 meters, covering up to 20 square kilometers in some Alaskan fields (even larger in Siberia), and storing as much as a third of the annual discharge of the river in the form of ice. In addition, aufeis maintain an unfrozen base throughout winter due to the release of latent heat as water is converted to ice, which warms the underlying sediments, and a thick insulating layer of ice above. Although aufeis have been studied by hydrologists and are known to be required for winter and spawning habitat for important local fish species, understanding of their ecology is poor. In recognition of this, these investigators will conduct a targeted assessment of the ecological importance of a single aufeis field on the Kuparuk River, Alaska as a first step toward developing a hypothesis-driven research program. <br/><br/>The investigators propose that aufeis be viewed as winter oases due to their wet bases that supply water and heat to otherwise frozen habitats. Aufeis also function as summer oases by providing a stable supply of water to riverbed and downstream habitats. This preliminary study will focus on assessing 1) river flow and nutrient chemistry above, within, and below the aufeis field, and 2) the potential for year-round, unfrozen habitat beneath the aufeis field. The investigators will collect water samples for nutrient analysis in transects extending 2.5 km upstream and downstream from the aufeis field. They will collect hourly data on river stage, temperature, and electrical conductivity along each transect. They will also install pairs of piezometers to depths of 1 meter and 2 meters to measure the vertical hydraulic gradient between the underlying aquifer and the surface channel, and dissolved oxygen, temperature, and electrical conductivity of hyporheic waters at these points. Measurements of vertical hydraulic gradient will determine whether river reaches are generally upwelling or downwelling. To estimate volume and the potential seasonal contributions of the aufeis to river discharge they will use precise digital elevation models created from low-altitude vertical photogrammetry. Year-round temperature and electrical conductivity records will provide data for simple end-member mixing analyses to determine the proportion of aufeis meltwater to the river during the thaw season. During freeze-up and into the winter, these records will provide estimates of potential downstream influences of the spring-water downstream of the aufeis if subsurface flow is maintained. In order to assess the vertical influence of aufeis, the investigators will instrument nine transects with digital temperature loggers. They anticipate that loggers directly under the aufeis will never record temperatures below freezing but that those outside the aufeis footprint will. The investigators also propose August and April ground-penetrating radar surveys to determine thaw depths. Finally, PVC wells penetrating about one meter below the surface will be used to sample small invertebrate animals living in river sediments and below aufeis. The project will support two masters-level graduate students and will involve two undergraduate field assistants in the summer fieldwork."

As tectonic plates move and deform, faults (or cracks) between and embedded in the plates do not slide but are locked due to frictional resistance. As time passes (tens to hundreds of years for large earthquakes) the stress on these faults increases. An earthquake rupture occurs when the level of stress resolved on the fault exceeds the frictional resistance (at least in some local region of the fault). Thus modeling the full earthquake cycle (tectonic loading, nucleation, and full evolution of rupture) is challenging because it requires the resolution of many vastly different timescales. Additional challenges arise from the fact that faults are geometrically complex -- with large-scale bends and branches as well as small-scale non-planar features -- and are surrounded by heterogeneous materials including sediments and clays, as well as much stiffer materials such as granite. Furthermore, field observations of faults reveal an abundance of cracks and micro-fractures -- often referred to as a damage zone -- which must often be included in models to produce realistic results. In this project we will develop, validate, and utilize an earthquake cycle model that can rigorously and self-consistently handle complex fault geometries, damage zones, and heterogeneous materials. We will also explore how geometry and heterogeneity affect the earthquake locations, magnitudes, and recurrence intervals. This proposed work benefits the society at large as understanding the impact of complexity on the earthquake cycle directly informs our understanding of seismic hazard.<br/><br/>Seismic hazard analysis requires an understanding of the earthquake cycle including the interaction of remote loading and near-fault structure. Currently, no existing models can account for both the interseismic and coseismic periods with complex fault geometries, heterogeneous materials, and plastic deformation. This funding supports the development and application of a numerical model that rigorously accounts for interseismic loading as well as rupture dynamics in both two- and three-dimensions. To capture the effect of slow tectonic loading on the evolution of the stress field, a computationally efficient quasi-static model will be used. As inertial effects become important, the model will transition to a fully dynamic description where the wavefield is modeled along with its interaction with fault interfaces. All stages of the earthquake cycle will be modeled in a single, self-consistent computational and mathematical framework capable of capturing both complex geometries and material descriptions. The group will develop a parallel quasi-static and dynamic rupture modeling environment that handles complex geometries (e.g., branches, bends, and step-overs), general boundary conditions, plastic deformation, and variable material and frictional properties. The investigators will use the developed model to consider how geometry affects nucleation location, recurrence interval, magnitude, and evolution of the near-fault stress field will be studied as well as the role that plasticity and bi-material properties play when all stages of the earthquake cycle are rigorously considered."

Phase I initiated a Master Teacher Job Shadow for freshmen/sophomore STEM majors, providing an opportunity for undergraduate STEM majors to spend an entire week with a Master Teacher for a realistic look into the profession. Phase II will provide an opportunity to reach into its community college partners' STEM major populations to identify additional shadowers.<br/><br/>Through T4 Phase II, project researchers will conduct longitudinal investigations into (1) How early teaching engagement and short-term mentoring activities affect STEM majors' persistence and career choice; (2) What factors affect Scholars' persistence to degree and persistence to undergraduate STEM teaching certification; and (3) How inclusion into the T4 mentoring community impacts the Scholars in the areas of teaching efficacy, their students' learning, and their growth as teacher leaders. Phase II will sustain paired longitudinal comparison groups developed in Phase I and generate new comparison groups for the new Scholars. T4 Phase II will expand opportunities to study the effect of the cohort model on preservice teachers as well as the impact of including Master Teacher mentors in their preparation. Better understanding the linkage between supportive academic community and the retention of classroom teachers is vital to improving teacher retention rates nationwide."

The structure of centromeres is not well understood, although coordinated changes in the DNA and associated factors are necessary for centromere function. Furthermore, centromere structure and function can change over time raising questions about how the genome responds and adapt at the chromosome level. Centromeres are difficult to study because they are composed of retrotranspons and other mobile elements that consist of highly repetitive sequences. The ability to assemble spans of short repeated sequences is notoriously difficult, so the centromere regions of chromosomes have remained nearly obscure to researchers. This project will sequence and analyze the centromere regions of all ten maize chromosomes using new sequencing technologies and software tools that permit assembly and analysis of the repetitive sequences and will permit study of the associated factors unique to centromeres. The results of this project will add value to the already sequenced maize genome and will result in an improved reference genome fully available to the plant research community. By discovering the structure and function of centromeres, the potential to construct artificial chromosomes will be expanded and agronomic traits associated with centromeres may be identified. As part of the project, undergraduate students will be trained in modern plant engineering methods and synthetic biology. The team of undergraduate students will participate in an international student research competition, thus promoting student and public understanding of plant centromeres and synthetic biology. <br/><br/>Little is known about the role of DNA in centromere function and evolution. In a first step, the nature and arrangement of centromere-specific repeats at all ten maize centromeres of the inbred B73 reference genome will be determined using PacBio technology. The impact of these repeats on the deposition of centromere-specific proteins will be determined using a number of different experimental approaches, including comparative genomics and epigenomics, as well as biochemical and genetic assays. Neocentromere formation is an epigenetic change that involves movement of CENH3, the centromere specific histone H3, to a new genomic region. Rapid invasion of neocentromeres by centromeric retrotransposons (CR) provides an unprecedented opportunity to study the interplay of epigenetic and genetic changes. A large number of epigenetic marks have been, or are being, mapped in the standard maize genomes. Histone H2A.Z nucleosomes, which may represent persistent marks of transcribed regions, will be mapped and integrated with all available epigenetic signatures to determine the reciprocal effects of genetic (double-stranded DNA breaks and retrotransposons insertion) and epigenetic (histone variants, histone modifications, gene expression, DNA methylation). At least one additional epigenetic marker that specifically binds centromeric repeats will be characterized in detail. All data produced in the course of this research will be deposited at MaizeGDB (maizegdb.org) and GenBank (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/)."

Studies demonstrate that larvae of species that inhabit shallow waters can behaviorally respond to changing oceanographic conditions by moving vertically into currents that can promote their transport to coastal, nearshore habitats where they settle to bottom habitats and complete their life cycle. However, the oceanographic mechanisms that promote such transport, and how they might be impacted by infrequent events such as El Niño, are poorly resolved. Given that El Niño events might increase in frequency and magnitude under climate change, it is imperative to assess how El Niño affects larval transport and larval settlement. To this end, this study will use an unprecedented set of nearshore biological and physical measurements spanning pre-El-Niño, during El Niño, and the predicted return to El Niño neutral conditions, to test mechanistically how larval transport and settlement respond in a nearshore coastal environment. This project will also provide educational and research opportunities for students at the University of San Diego, a liberal arts university. At least one laboratory exercise demonstrating the impacts of El Niño on larval transport and settlement will be developed for undergraduate students, and students will be recruited to participate in all aspects of the project to provide them with hands-on research experience. This research will form the basis for the thesis work of at least one M.S. graduate student. Finally, given that the research falls within a Marine Protected Area, results will be broadly disseminated and shared with coastal managers and the CA Department of Fish and Wildlife.<br/><br/>Larval transport and settlement are fundamental processes for understanding the population dynamics of benthic invertebrates. Previous studies and unpublished observations indicate that El Niño events profoundly impact community and population processes, and in Southern California, El Niño effects range from alteration of larval transport and settlement of local populations, to the geographic expansion of subtropical species. This research will test the hypothesis that the current (2015-2016) El Niño event will result in a reduction of barnacle larval transport and settlement in Southern California nearshore habitats. Two mechanisms might be involved; first, a deepening of the thermocline forced by El Niño would result in reduction of larval transport by internal tidal bores, a mechanism that requires shallowing of the thermocline. Second, the distribution of larvae of littoral barnacles would be deeper, more offshore, and less constrained to nearshore habitats during El Niño than in El Niño neutral conditions, resulting in a reduction of nearshore larval abundance and settlement. The effects of El Niño on nearshore circulation, hydrography, larval transport and settlement in Bird Rock, Southern California, will be measured by a) deploying an array of instrumentation to measure temperature, pressure (waves) and currents; b) measuring daily barnacle larval settlement, and; c) assessing cross-shore and depth distribution of invertebrate larvae. These observations will be contrasted with two years of comparable observations taken at Bird Rock in 2014 (El Niño neutral conditions) and 2015 (during El Niño). Additionally, the investigators will measure weekly settlement at Bird Rock, and at Dike Rock, a site 7 km to the north, where previous observations at the end of the 1997/1998 El Niño indicated that barnacle settlement was very high. This will enable the evaluation of the generality of the settlement response as El Niño conditions eclipse, and examination of how settlement varies along a coastline."

An important part of Arctic ecosystems and Aboriginal livelihood, wild reindeer have been monitored by scientists for almost 50 years. During this time, herds have exhibited large changes in size and these changes have been recorded in almost all herds across the animal?s range. The increase in the number of wild reindeer 20-30 years ago was almost universally followed by a significant population loss in the last decade. In addition, recent monitoring revealed substantial shifts in the distribution of wild populations. The decline in wild reindeer is likely related to natural cycles and changes in the Arctic environment caused by climate change and increased anthropogenic activity. In order to explain the observed changes in the abundance and distribution of reindeer, it is necessary to collect long-term and seasonal observations.  The Taimyr Reindeer Herd (TRH) is both the largest and the longest monitored wild reindeer herd in Eurasia. The Extreme North Agricultural Research Institute in Noril?sk, Russia, has observed the TRH since 1969. Only a limited amount of the information on the TRH has been released, digitized, processed, analyzed or published. Much of the information is held in single-copy paper in locations and under conditions that threaten its longevity. The proposed project aims to digitize all available past records concerning the Taimyr wild reindeer populations and develop related datasets on climate and habitat over the decades of observation. <br/><br/>The Taimyr Reindeer Migration Reanalysis (TAMARA) project will be based upon a collaborative and integrated interdisciplinary international network of reindeer experts, arctic researchers, and geospatial scientists. The project is designed to build a comprehensive and openly available information system that will provide insight into the historical relationship between humans, climate, environment, and reindeer. Building on both international and local experiences the investigators will implement a major data digitization and dissemination effort that will be a considerable contribution to the polar cyberinfrastructure pertaining to Arctic terrestrial mammals. The project has the following objectives: 1) Retrieve, digitize, archive, transfer, process and publish historical observational data collected between 1969 and 2009, document relevant methodologies, and develop appropriate metadata; 2) Develop value-added data products resulting from the (re)analysis of historical spatial migration patterns of the TRH; and 3) Contribute to developing polar spatial cyberinfrastructure by creating a comprehensive and open data visualization and data dissemination system. The TAMARA project will be an integral part of the worldwide network of reindeer observation programs. The project will involve US and Russian scientists and students, supporting one graduate student and two part-time undergraduates. Results will be widely disseminated to local residents and stakeholders. The project will contribute to the early career development of a young investigator."

Particular language practices underpin some types of social relationships while also hindering others. As social relationships change, languages change in form and function, enabling new forms of sociality. The research supported by this award asks: What new ways of using indigenous and global languages are emerging today? And how are these new verbal practices enabling or preventing social change? Supervised by Dr. Miki Makihara of City University of New York, anthropology doctoral student Mariapaola Gritti will investigate these questions through a 15-month linguistic-ethnographic study of children's language practices in a village in American Samoan, a U.S. territory. This project will advance understanding of social change, expand existing linguistic methodologies, and clarify how language practices can underpin the sustainability of communities. It will also inform language policy. By documenting children's communicative practices, this project will enable mid- and long-term monitoring of one such policy: the Samoan-language instruction program currently piloted by the American Samoa Department of Education and aimed both to improve educational achievement and foster local language and culture maintenance in this U.S. territory. <br/><br/>American Samoa is an particularly appropriate site for this research because residents there face changes on multiple fronts, including, their environment, culture, forms of social organization, and possibilities for political participation.  In addition, transnational kinship and economic relations, migration to Hawaii and the U.S. mainland, official use of English, attempts to introduce Samoan-language instruction in schools, and campaigns promoting Western pedagogical models all affect American Samoan ways of speaking Samoan and English. The intensity and simultaneity of these developments make the linguistic effects more salient for identification, documentation, and analysis, particularly in young children's speech. Therefore, Gritti will audio and video record and observe daily children's spontaneous social and linguistic interactions. She will survey these children's families and conduct ethnographic observation and interviews in the community. Her analysis of the language corpus will focus on two aspects of children's speech: (1) English borrowings into Samoan, which children use with variable frequency and phonology; and (2) personal pronouns, which children may use with a mixture of English or Samoan syntax and semantics. Employing the innovative concept of ""semiotic potential,"" Gritti will monitor changes in frequency and effects of variants across situations, among children, and over developmental stages, to highlight how children's emerging grammar systems reflect their communicative needs, while also contributing to change in the language they speak. Finally, children's mimetic or play activities will be analyzed to identify children's ideas about the different variants, about Samoan and English, and about the changing world around them."

Frozen water is present in the atmosphere -- in clouds -- where foreign particles such as mineral dust promote ice nucleation. Consequently, surface-assisted ice nucleation, i.e. heterogeneous ice nucleation, has a significant effect on cloud microphysics. This implies that it is important to accurately describe heterogeneous ice nucleation in order to be able to accurately model the weather and climate. Though theoretical and empirical descriptions have been developed, there is still no complete description of the requirements of the heterogeneous ice nucleation process, and no framework to know a priori if a given surface will be a good ice nucleating agent.<br/><br/>Through the synergistic experimental and simulation efforts, the foundation for molecular level understanding of heterogeneous ice nucleation will be built. The focus of this research will be to relate the effects of surface charge and lattice match to heterogeneous nucleation of ice with an emphasis on the free energy of formation and the nucleation rate. Straightforward molecular dynamics (MD) simulations will provide detailed insights into water behavior near mica surfaces and will be compared with experimental findings. In addition, the kinetics and thermodynamics of ice nucleation will be calculated from simulations. The research will provide the basis for building predictive models of heterogeneous ice nucleation that can be incorporated into larger scale models relevant to atmospheric chemistry and weather prediction.<br/><br/>The simulation tools developed and results of this research will provide the basis to answer several of the top 10 questions related to molecular behavior of frozen water as listed by Bartels-Rausch (Nature, 2013), which are essential for predicting the future of our planet. Phase transitions assisted by surfaces in aqueous systems are relevant to a wide variety of fields and processes including biological assemblies, surfactants, nanotoxicology, semiconductor industry, food industry and others. Also, the research presents several learning opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students in different forms. The collaborative nature of this research and the exchange program between the two scientist groups will expose the students to a multitude of tools used to study challenging problems in atmospheric chemistry.<br/><br/>The simulations will be used to develop informative videos to be used as educational tools as well as for recruitment of students into science and engineering. User-friendly modules that enable students to perform some simple molecular simulations, which can be used as supplements for class lectures to illustrate concepts in thermodynamics, kinetics and materials will be developed. These will be available to the scientific community free-of-charge. The results from the research will be published in peer-reviewed journals and will be presented in various national and international meetings."

When authorities are viewed as legitimate, citizens have an enhanced intrinsic motivation to comply with the law and to cooperate with those who enforce it. This research tackles two key questions. What features of enforcement institutions bestow legitimacy on authorities? And what are the consequences of legitimacy for citizen behavior? <br/><br/>It employs both laboratory and lab-in-the-field experiments, the latter of which enhance policy relevance by focusing on subjects from low-income, mostly minority communities, whose experiences of law enforcement may differ from those of typical student subject pools.  Assessing the causal antecedents of legitimate authority is a surprisingly tricky empirical problem. Given that citizens' compliance with the law may be motivated both by deterrence and by citizens' perceptions of legitimacy, how can legitimacy be measured in a way that is separate from citizens' anticipations of punishment? This work employs novel experiments designed to decouple the relationship between citizens' extrinsic (deterrence) and intrinsic (legitimacy-based) motivations."

The project will investigate the complex interplay between biodiversity conservation, cultural identity, and rural development in order to understand how buffer zones and CBC projects shape rural property regimes, reproduce or alleviate socioeconomic inequalities, and inform new political subjectivities and indigenous territorial claims. The project focuses on national park buffer zones in South Asia, a strategically important, politically volatile region and a vital contributor to global biodiversity, and the specific case of Nepal, which has experienced both a Maoist-inspired insurgency and an expansion in CBC projects. Community-based conservation projects are intended to promote rural socio-economic development and political participation, reduce political tensions over land distribution, and create the conditions of biodiversity conservation in the countryside. Actual experiences of such projects are mixed. This project is expected to expand understanding of the effects of such projects in order to aid international policy-making efforts to improve conservation and development planning. Findings will be disseminated through presentations in workshops and conferences in the U.S., Nepal, and elsewhere. The project may also promote STEM education through the dissemination of results relevant to conservation biology and support U.S. security interests through the dissemination of knowledge about Nepal's rural political conditions. The research will also contribute to academic programs at Florida International University, a minority-serving public institution that prepare graduates for success in a globally competitive workforce.   <br/><br/>Questions of how and to what effect CBC projects intersect with identity politics surrounding territorial claims and land rights are central, but unsettled in the scientific literature.

At the other extreme, some studies have credited the introduction of CBCs with strengthening local community land rights and indigenous peoples' territorial claims. Findings from this study will be used to improve the theorization of disparate outcomes. The primary questions pursued are: 1) what effects do CBC initiatives have on socioeconomic inequalities and vice versa; 2) how are CBC initiatives implicated in state making and social identity formation; and 3) what effects do CBC initiatives have on rural property relations and indigenous territorial claims? The project employs a mix of ethnographic and quantitative methods in an extended field study of two buffer zone communities in Nepal. Methods include participant observation, in-depth semi-structured interviews, and document analysis."

The core challenges are: (a) how to sustain the attention network, (b) how to maintain strong connections among female faculty in their immediate professional environments and, (c) how to create weak ties that will help them in situations where their strong ties are unable to provide the social support, collaboration and information that they need.  The outcomes of the research will improve the faculty's understanding of the importance of networking, provide opportunities for sustaining collaborative connections with colleagues across the nation, and equip participants with the knowledge and skills to collaborate in a networked world.  The summative evaluation, including a before and after social network analysis, will evaluate the effectiveness of the purposeful interventions into the existing network of mostly weak ties among geotechnical women faculty and recommend promising practices for use in other disciplines where women face similar challenges."

The 2015-16 El Niño is among the three strongest since 1950. Strong El Niño events bring climate anomalies worldwide, including increased temperatures, reduced cloud cover, decreased rainfall, and drought over a large portion of the Tropics. The eight forests in this study occur along a steep rainfall gradient from the wet Caribbean to the dry Pacific coast of Panama. The project capitalizes on previously mapped populations of seedlings and trees in each of these forests. Although the 2015-16 El Niño initially benefitted trees by reducing cloud cover and increasing light availability during the 2015 rainy season, the dry season began earlier than normal, which likely means a severe drought lies ahead. The project will test several hypotheses about how tree species in normally wet and dry forests respond differently to reduced rainfall. The net effect of drought and increased light on the health of seedlings and adult trees will determine which species regenerate, potentially altering long-term composition of the forests. This project is important because tropical forests play a vital role in global carbon and water cycles and are the most biologically diverse ecosystem on the planet. Also, a deeper understanding of how plant species respond to El Niño events will provide insight into how forests will respond to long-term climate change.<br/><br/>During the 2016 El Niño event, researchers will survey an existing network of tree seedling plots within eight forests that span a pronounced rainfall gradient in central in Panama. Censuses will measure seedling recruitment, growth and survival across two size classes and (1) determine which forest sites and tree species are most affected by an extreme El Niño event, (2) examine the relative roles of reduced soil water availability and increased light on seedling performance, (3) evaluate the predictive value of functional traits for seedling responses to El Niño, (4) measure the size distribution of El Niño-related seedling mortality, and (5) provide a baseline for modeling the effects of extreme El Niño events on tropical forests through assessing minimum soil and leaf water potentials and their variation across forests and species. The project is among the most comprehensive studies of the effects of an El Niño event on tropical forest regeneration to date and will provide insight into variation of responses within and among species, seedling size classes, and forests. The research will improve projections for consequences of global climate change for these forests, as well as for vegetation-climate feedbacks, which will be important for forest management under current and future climate conditions. The project will also facilitate future research efforts both in Panama and in other tropical regions by providing research infrastructure and data from a relatively new set of plots in Panama and by gathering comparative performance data for a wide range of species.

Since the time of Leonardo da Vinci, friction - sliding resistance between two objects - has been one of the most challenging subjects still incomplete in understanding but crucial in advancement of modern science and technology. For example, it is critical in controlling sliding mechanisms in nano-manipulators as well as in measuring and predicting forces building up at tectonic fault lines. Here, the principal investigator plans to develop an innovative mechanics framework - renormalization of friction, i.e. successive evaluation of larger length scale friction with smaller length scale friction behavior, and verify it with controlled experiments. The fundamental studies of this project will establish a systematic framework for regulating nanoscale friction to control macroscopic friction. The multi-scale framework of friction will be essential for developing not only nano-mechanical device technology but also friction-control technology in robotics and bio-medical device engineering, as well as for solving scientific problems in geology. It will also advance computational modeling and design capabilities for manufacturing processes sensitive to friction control, widely encountered in production industries. In addition, under this project, the principal investigator will develop an outreach program at Brown, to educate underrepresented students through summer internship programs, and to develop new course material.<br/><br/>Over the past two and half decades, research on multi-scale frictional processes has been very active to uncover the molecular origin of these processes and to bridge understanding of the phenomena at different length scales. Recently the principal investigator's group revealed that renormalization softening/strengthening of friction develops depending on the reduction of molecular adhesive friction stress, scale-dependent flattening of asperities or stiffening of the surface. This unique scheme of friction renormalization is very powerful in investigating multi-scale friction processes of rough surfaces. With this award, the principal investigator will study (i) renormalization strengthening in rough-surface friction; (ii) Ruga (surface corrugation) control of hierarchical roughness to study renormalization of friction; (iii) evolution of roughness spectra and friction due to asperity plasticity and wear."

This process occurs in leaves but how different types of leaves differ in their ability to produce carbon compounds is not well understood. Nor do we understand how genes act and interact to produce leaves of different shapes and sizes. This project will utilize analysis of how genes are regulated to generate gene products that interact to create cascades of effects eventually leading to the formation of different forms of leaves. This understanding will allow us to manipulate gene expression to generate more efficient leaf forms. This project will also disseminate knowledge of gene regulation and leaf function, and provide hands on research experience to high school students from a predominantly Hispanic school district.<br/><br/>How morphological diversity has arisen is a key question in biology. Angiosperms exhibit a great diversity in leaf shape and leaf development has been characterized in several species, making leaves ideal targets to understand the mechanism behind morphological natural variation. Leaves are also functionally significant for generating biomass and leading to agricultural yield. This research is based upon a deduced gene co-expression network underlying leaf development in tomato and its relatives. Molecular experiments and hypothesis testing validated the bioinformatically predicted gene regulatory network (GRN) and identified key components, such as BLADE-ON-PETIOLE (BOP), within the gene network module regulating leaf shape. Alteration in BOP expression by transgenic experiments in tomato, S. pennellii and S. habrochaites, can recreate naturally occurring leaf phenotypes in the tomato species complex. The investigators will identify BOP targets, look at BOP co-expressed genes to integrate network information across three species (Aim 1), detect differential interactions (DiffCorr) between genes in the GRN across species (Aim 2), and generate transcriptomes and build GRNs to identify GRN rewiring across selected eudicots (Aim 3)."

Cosmic ray antideuteron particles are a particularly interesting potential signature of dark matter annihilation.  This CAREER award supports scientists at the University of Hawaii to study dark matter by performing the first measurements of the cosmic-ray antideuteron flux.  The group will utilize data from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS), currently operating onboard the International Space Station, and data from the General Antiparticle Spectrometer (GAPS), a balloon experiment that is under development.  This award will support scientific investigations that utilize the complementary capabilities of both experiments to perform high-sensitivity measurements of cosmic-ray antideuterons.  The group is also developing a summer course to teach computer programming to local high school students.  Students will be taught programming skills using Raspberry Pi computers.  Mimicking scientific ballooning operations, the devices will be mounted on kites to measure temperatures and humidity, and take aerial pictures.<br/> <br/>The planned program includes the development of antideuteron production physics simulations, analysis of AMS data, simulations and calibration of the GAPS detectors, and ultimately analysis of GAPS data.

The project focuses on two areas where new research methods and results are needed in order to inform ongoing policy debates. One strand of research focuses on improving our understanding of local networks of buyer-supplier relationships. Specifically, the PI studies how local buyer-supplier networks can improve firm performance, and the role that they play in spreading shocks across local economies. Improving our understanding of these issues can help us anticipate the impact that shocks to important local firms can have on the larger economy. The second research strand studies the tradeoff between encouraging industrial growth in cities and protecting the local environment, which has implications for the health of city residents, city growth, and population sorting. To make progress on these important issues, this project combines data tracking the economic development of cities over the long-run (across a period of 150 years) with new theoretical and econometric tools. The primary data set describes the evolution of city employment, by industry, for all industries in 31 cities. Additional information covers aspects of city health, education, marriage and fertility patterns, firm bankruptcies, etc. <br/><br/>More analytically, the first strand of research in this project draws on these new data in order to understand (1) how inter-firm networks influence the long-term growth of cities and (2) the role that these networks play in the propagation of shocks through local economies. This involves adapting standard economic theories to the empirical setting, deriving theoretically-grounded estimating equations, and applying them to the data. This research stream can contribute to our understanding of cities and can help improve local industrial policy decisions, including the $80 billion in tax incentives that local and state governments in the U.S. use each year to attract industries.<br/>The second strand of research in this project tries to estimate the impact of local environmental degradation on local economic growth over the long run. Standard urban economic theories predict that local pollution will slow down economic growth by (1) making it more difficult for firms to attract and retain workers, and (2) by lowering the productivity and quality-of-life of workers by affecting their health. In this strand of work, the PI incorporates local pollution into a standard urban economic model. The model is then used to develop a theoretically-grounded estimation approach for measuring the impact of local pollution on local employment growth over the long-run. The PI also studies the long-term health effects of local pollution. The results can help improve our understanding of the economic costs of local industrial pollution and the economic impact of local environmental regulation."

The objective of this project is to respond to the crucial challenge of developing an integrated approach that captures all these requirements within a single framework in order to improve the scope and applicability of multi-agent techniques in real-world applications. The long-term broader impacts of this project include the potential for the research findings to improve decentralized decision-making in real-world problems. In the short term, high-school students will benefit from the education modules developed by the PI, which will be disseminated through collaborations with local outreach programs as well as local teachers and summer camp organizers. The students will develop better computational thinking skills and be exposed to computational concepts applied to relevant applications of interest.

This project examines how legal institutions affect business formation and expansion, and more generally, what types of legal rules might be effective in fostering investment and commercial growth. Understanding the legal structures that promote business growth and establishment of a robust private sector reveals political and legal insights that promote successful enterprise. <br/><br/>This project explores these questions by constructing a large, novel dataset of Turkish and Egyptian partnerships and corporations at the firm level between 1887 and 1950. The main sources of this dataset are business directories and commercial newspapers that published partnership contracts and corporation charters. The investigator will use this firm-level dataset to develop and test a theory of partnership formation and dissolution; examine the relationship between legal forms of firm organization, transplantation of European law, and business expansion; explore the links between corporate governance, industrialization and the political economy of these two countries; and investigate the disappearance of non-Muslim enterprises which had long dominated the Middle East's commercial life. The examination of corporations and their boards of directors, especially the formation of an interlocking directorate made up of securities underwriters and government members, will reveal the role of corporate governance and the state in industrialization, industrial organization, and firm performance."

Understanding their detailed mechanism, especially when it is at a mature stage, is quite important for hazard mitigation. Progress in the atmospheric sciences has been remarkable in the last few decades because of multi-faceted observations from aircraft, radar, and satellite observations. However, monitoring the intensity changes of these hurricanes while they are still in warm oceans has been quite difficult from these observations alone. This study will explore the use of seismic data for monitoring sudden changes in hurricane strength. Hurricanes generate ground motions in the Earth and a sudden intensification naturally leads to the excitation of larger seismic waves. The key to developing such a seismic monitoring scheme is in the basic understanding of the seismic-wave excitation by hurricanes. This seems to be a reachable goal within a few years, aided with data from the USArray network.<br/><br/>Technically, the generation of strong ground motions by hurricanes is one of the strongest examples of mechanical couplings between the atmosphere and the solid earth. The USArray network unexpectedly recorded hurricane data that are unique because of dual installation of barometers and seismometers. These data are the cause and effect of the atmosphere-land interactions because barometers provide the information on the excitation source (surface pressure) and seismometers provide the resultant seismic wavefields. Our investigation on Hurricane Isaac (2012) has shown that these data can give us fresh new insights into the seismic-wave excitation process. The primary goal of this project is to extend our current approach to other hurricanes in the USArray data and test the stochastic, seismic-wave excitation theory that has been developed. This knowledge will then be applied to monitoring the intensity changes of hurricanes while they are still in the oceans. If such a monitoring becomes possible, it can be a useful tool for hurricane-hazard mitigation in combination with atmospheric and satellite-based data."

Accurate model representation of such turbulent fluxes from the surface is essential for precise hydrologic, weather, and climate predictions. Our current model representation of turbulent fluxes assumes that most eddies transport can be explained by local observations and parameters in models. Nonetheless variability in the horizontal (e.g. due to variability in the surface characteristics) and in the vertical (due to eddies that span an unusually large vertical extend) directions can invalidate these assumptions. In this proposal we will test the latter effect using a combination of high-resolution turbulence models and observations. Our main objective is to better account for the largest ? most efficient ? eddies in our representation of turbulent exchange at the surface. This should ultimately improve the way we measure surface fluxes and model them. One flux of special interest is evaporation (the flux of moisture), which impacts hydrological forecasts (such as streamflow) along with weather and climate predictions. Along with this research activity, one of the main educational objectives of this proposal is to provide science exposure and encourage under-represented groups in Harlem, NY to choose scientific careers and education through science demonstrations and high-school internships.<br/><br/>Most current formulations of the surface turbulent transport laws are based on Monin-Obukhov Similarity Theory (MOST), which is based on local surface layer scaling. This theory has been shown to be deficient in recent years. One of the main causes of this deficiency is due to the presence of coherent turbulent structures, which transport turbulent properties over large distances from the top of the boundary layer down to the surface. These structures cannot readily be observed by time-averaging eddy-covariance technique and may be one of the main reasons of non-closure of the in situ surface energy budget, which are used to validate our land-surface models. To address these issues, the research objectives of this proposal are to: <br/>i)	Investigate the role of non-local transport related to the entrainment at the boundary layer top and its interaction with surface turbulence using Direct Numerical Simulations (DNS) and Large-Eddy Simulations (LES),<br/>ii)	Derive new surface turbulent laws and profile similarity accounting for the effect of non-local transport, <br/>iii)	Define large-eddy corrections for eddy-covariance observations of surface turbulent fluxes. <br/>iv)	Evaluate the impact of these new formulations in a coupled land-surface and weather model.<br/>Consistent with this research activity, the educational objectives of the proposal are to: a) develop international student exchange programs, b) encourage and advise under-represented groups to participate in STEM research and c) develop classes (e.g. land-atmosphere interactions and turbulence) with a broad vision of the problem geared toward multiple scientific communities to facilitate cross-disciplinary collaborations and work."

The outcome of this project is a robust acoustic sensing technology that has a high accuracy in predicting actual failures of HVAC systems.

This project develops acoustic signal acquisition and processing techniques that preserve the privacy of everyone and everything that is susceptible to privacy violations due to continuous acoustic monitoring. The proposed collaborative research enables buildings to be retrofitted with a low-cost, acoustic sensing solution to monitor its HVAC systems to predict their impending failures. A major goal of this project is to reduce false positives when making these predictions that are primarily caused by inadequate modeling of sounds from a faulty component, inadequate modeling of different types of faults, and errors in sound source recognition. Furthermore, this project creates a foundation for the next generation of intelligent systems that autonomously monitor equipment and predict failure.<br/><br/>The project engages University of Florida and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to augment research capability in conducting visualization-based dynamic assessment of HVAC systems, and building low-cost, embedded device-based centralized HVAC monitoring systems.

Virtually all species, including humans, have been and continue to be strongly influenced by symbioses. Ultimately, a comprehensive understanding of the history of life on Earth requires the detailed understanding of the evolutionary and ecological forces shaping species symbioses. The over-arching goal of this research project is to integrate evolutionary (genealogical) and ecological (species interactions) network analyses to test hypotheses about the origins and control of symbiotic associations. This work will focus on the evolution of specificity between symbiotic partners (generalists vs. specialists) using lichen symbioses as a model system. The project builds on a great deal of prior genetic analyses, which have been conducted on over 700 symbiotic associations between fungal and algal species, which give rise to lichens. This project will also provide opportunities for postdoc and undergraduate student training, and will develop non-technical web pages outlining the project to be made available to the public. There will also be professional symposia on the development of novel computational methods for studying symbioses. High school students will be invited to participate in this project based on their interest in a general workshop on lichen symbioses that will be organized. <br/><br/>The datasets and phylogenetic results generated by previous studies, provide a unique opportunity to address the following objectives of this study: (1) conduct a network analysis to reveal the association trends of the two mutualistic partners giving rise to lichens, and to infer the most important contributing factors to those associations; (2) compare these results from lichens with other fungal-photoautotrophic systems (e.g., mycorrhizae, endophytes); and (3) design new phylogenetic methods to study the evolution of specificity of interacting fungi and cyanobacteria or algae, and to identify factors correlated with shifts in specificity toward lower or higher specificity in species associations (generalists or specialists). This project is expected to advance the field by coupling the inferential power of phylogenetics with ecological network theory to study symbiotic associations among species within lichens. This new approach for what may be called eco-phylogenetic analysis will estimate, for the first time, the contribution of biotic and abiotic factors through time that best explain the patterns of symbiotic associations observed in nature. The methods developed will be applicable to other symbioses, beyond lichens."

Within this global context are some regional cooling trends that also result from human activity, including those that are beneficial to economic and conservation objectives. One of these cooling trends has been found in the summer in the northern North American Great Plains. Maximum air temperatures have decreased by over three degrees and rainfall has increased by an inch during summer across parts of the Canadian Prairie Provinces since the 1970s. These changes are thought to be due to a decrease in the practice of keeping farm fields fallow during summer; Canada alone has lost around 35 million acres of fallow from the 1970s to the present. The United States has seen a similar decline in fallow area, largely in the Northern Great Plains, but the effects of these changes on regional climate in the U.S. have not been studied to date. Fallow was, and still is, widely practiced to save water for subsequent crops in dry regions, but also increases soil erosion and degradation and is not considered sustainable. Producers have also realized that the water-savings benefit of fallow is often outweighed by the economic losses of not planting a crop. The goal of this project is to understand how agricultural management practices that improve soil conservation and may increase on-farm income can also be beneficial to climate, both now and over the coming decades. As part of the project, a field course will be designed to link Tribal Colleges in the Montana University System with the goal of enhancing STEM education among underrepresented students. Project activities will also enhance existing efforts to improve after-school educational programs at the grade-school level. An inter-university consortium will be designed to coordinate research activities in the atmospheric sciences across Montana, including Tribal Colleges. <br/><br/>To understand the role of land management on regional climate, it is necessary to understand the mechanisms by which it influences the climate system, and to integrate this understanding into models that can predict future climate dynamics. In a region with substantial fallow, warm and dry air from near the land surface rises and creates a high and dry atmospheric boundary layer that is unlikely to experience convective precipitation. If plants are present, more moisture and less heat enters the atmosphere, resulting in a moister atmospheric boundary layer that is not nearly as high, which makes cloud formation convective precipitation processes more likely. In this project, the exchange of heat and water between the surface and atmosphere in fallow, grasslands, and crops will be measured, and atmospheric boundary layer development, convective precipitation, and regional climate modeled. Models will be run over the past three decades to understand how management trends have influenced climate and over the forthcoming three decades to understand how future land management changes may, or may not, continue to counter global warming trends."

While there has been much interest in women's victimization and peacebuilding efforts, little attention has been directed to understanding how women holistically manage and advocate for their security in their communities. This project explores how individual and organizational narratives form a part of or potentially subvert dominant international discourses on women's roles and experiences in conflict as well as the relationship between women and peace. By prioritizing women's knowledge of their own security needs, this study contributes to efforts to improve U.S. foreign policy goals of women ""as equal partners in preventing conflict and building peace."" Ultimately, this study advances an understanding of how and to what extent international gender norms affect national policies and local implementation strategies, as well as how international policy-making in gender mainstreaming is fundamentally different from other types of security policy efforts. <br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>Specifically, this project addresses how local and national women's organizations in post-conflict areas of West Africa work to advocate for women's security. To do so, this study uses participant observation and interviews in Guinea and Mali (building on prior research in Cote d'Ivoire) to reveal how international resolutions impact local actions and also whether and how local women's priorities can shape international policies. Analyzing policies on women's security and the discourses that sustain them through macro-, meso-, and micro-level lenses will reveal how local and regional women's community organizations define their security goals and priorities, translate and localize the international agendas of the UN Security Council and transnational NGOs as well as the national agendas of governments, and work with local women to achieve peace and security. By examining the conflicts in Guinea and Mali, this project will develop a framework of how to understand women's needs in their communities and in national peacebuilding and reconstruction projects, underscoring that historical, political, and cultural contexts are important in developing successful, appropriate security policies."

Many of these local governments use a portion of their public funds to hire lobbyists to represent them both before the federal government and their state capitals. They seek grant money and favorable policies that will increase their power, autonomy, and institutional flexibility. However, the interest group literature on lobbying has largely neglected this phenomenon, and as a result we know little about the causes and consequences of intergovernmental lobbying. The investigator asks: What explains variation in lobbying efforts by local governments, and is spending money on lobbyist representation a good investment? The investigator develops a theory that intergovernmental lobbying is a way for local governments to compensate for weak representation by higher-level officials. She uses lobbying expenditure reports, local political and demographic information, and public finance data to demonstrate which local governments lobby and what they get as a result of these lobbying activities. <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>The investigator constructs an original longitudinal dataset on local government lobbying in all 50 states. While local governments also lobby the federal government, the majority of their efforts are targeted towards their state capitals, given the unique authority that states have to restructure local units financially, administratively, and politically. Although federal lobbying data is readily available as a result of the 1995 Lobbying Disclosure Act, there exists no publically available composite dataset of state-level lobbying expenditures. This lack of centralized data has become increasingly problematic as lobbying at the state level has soared over the past decade, often outpacing national lobbying efforts. Panel data on intergovernmental lobbying across states will allow the investigator to employ several strategies to identify the correlates of local government lobbying and estimate the effects of this behavior. Initial evidence from California using a fixed effects approach and over a decade of data on city lobbying and finance shows that cities allocate more money to lobbying when they receive a new state assembly member, and spending more on lobbying leads cities to secure more discretionary funding from the state. However, institutional variables at the state level are likely key to explain variation in local government lobbying efforts and outcomes. This project contributes to the theoretical literature on interest groups and fiscal federalism by providing new empirical evidence on the way in which local governments use intergovernmental lobbying to compete with each other to provide services for their residents."

However, in the ocean this seawater circulation, many times heated by buried magmatic bodies, transports and releases 25% of the Earth's heat. The rate of fluid flow through ocean crust is estimated to be equal to the amount of water delivered by rivers to the ocean. Much of what we know of this subseafloor fluid flow comes from studies in the eastern Pacific Ocean on ocean crust created by medium and fast spreading mid-ocean ridges. These studies indicate that seawater and its circulation through the seafloor significantly impact crustal evolution and biogeochemical cycles in the ocean and affect the biosphere in ways that are just now beginning to be quantified and understood. To expand this understanding, this research focuses on fluid flow of seafloor generated by slow spreading ridges, like those in the Atlantic, Indian and Arctic Oceans because it is significantly different in structure, mineralogy, and morphology than that formed at fast and intermediate spreading ridges. This research returns to North Pond, a long-term; seafloor; fluid flow monitoring site, drilled and instumented by the Ocean Drilling Program in the Atlantic Ocean.  This research site was punctured by boreholes in which fluid flow and geochemical and biological samplers have been deployed for a number of years to collect data and samples. It also provides resources for shipboard and on-shore geochemical and biological analysis.  Broader impacts of the work include sensor and technology development, which increases infrastructure for science and has commercial applications. It also provides training for students and the integration of education and research at three US academic institutions, one of which is an EPSCoR state (Mississippi), and supports a PI whose gender is under-represented in sciences and engineering.  Public outreach will be carried out in conjunction with the Center for Dark Energy Biosphere Investigations.    <br/><br/>This project completes a long-term biogeochemical and hydrologic study of ridge flank hydrothermal processes on slow-spreading, 8 million year old crust on the western flank of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. The site, North Pond, is an isolated northeast-trending sediment pond, bounded by undersea mountains that have been studied since the 1970s. During Integrated Ocean Drilling Program Expedition 336 in 2011 and an expedition five months later (2012), sensors, samplers, and experiments were deployed in four borehole observatories drilled into the seafloor that penetrated into volcanic crust, with the purpose of monitoring changes in hydrologic properties, crustal fluid composition and mineral alteration, among other objectives. Wellhead sampling in 2012 and 2014 already revealed changes in crustal fluid compositions; and associated pressure data confirm that the boreholes are sealed and overpressured, reflecting a change in the formation as the boreholes recover from drilling disturbances. This research includes a 13-day oceanographic expedition and use of on-site robotically operated vehicles to recover downhole instrument packages at North Pond. It will allow the sampling of crustal fluids, recovering pressure data, and measuring fluid flow rates. Ship- and shore-based analyses will be used to address fundamental questions related to the hydrogeology of hydrothermal processes on slow-spread crust."

The investigators will measure chewing patterns in 23 primate species that are given foods spanning a range of material properties, to see how individuals in each species process the different foods and how this processing relates to the shape of their jaw and skull. These comparative data will be important not only for framing ecological research in living primate species, but for reconstructing diet and feeding behaviors in extinct primate and hominin species based on fossil jaws and skulls. The project will foster interdisciplinary approaches to training and education involving members of under-represented groups, and will support training and mentorship of a postdoctoral fellow, graduate students and undergraduates as well as local STEM teachers and students, all of whom will participate in lab apprenticeship, scientific presentations and public outreach to local institutions and the lay public.  Therefore, another benefit to society includes development of a novel training environment for the next generation of academic researchers and educators.<br/><br/>Phenotypic variation in the primate skull is influenced by masticatory stress, with taxa relying on stiff or tough foods having specialized jaws, teeth and jaw muscles.  However, the link between diet and jaw form in living and fossil primates is poorly understood.  Difficulty understanding adaptive diversity in the feeding apparatus is due to two shortcomings of the evidence about diet-related chewing and loading behaviors. The first is the fact that infrequent, high-magnitude forces elicit the same physiological and evolutionary responses in bone as do low-magnitude, cyclical loads.  In the skull, a second and related issue is a surprisingly incomplete knowledge of the role of food properties on variation in chewing behaviors that underlie load-related variation in primate jaw form.  Given the ubiquity with which cyclical loading is invoked to explain jaw robusticity in fossil hominins, the remarkable lack of key behavioral data on this chewing pattern cannot be overstated.  Using in vivo data on 23 representative primate species kept in domestic institutions, this project tests the hypothesis that food material properties affect masticatory parameters underlying variation in cyclical loading of primate jaws: chewing frequency, chewing investment, and chewing duration.  High-speed video will record dynamic diet-related chewing patterns in isolated and unrestrained adult primates presented a known mass of five foods that span a range of material properties paralleling the diversity of values for items ingested by wild primates.  Intra- and interspecific analyses will compare chewing parameters with food stiffness, toughness, and respective oral fragmentation indices.  Due to its experimental and comparative focus, this in vivo research is likely to inform theoretical and methodological advances in biological anthropology and other organismal and biomedical fields."

The outcome of this project is a robust acoustic sensing technology that has a high accuracy in predicting actual failures of HVAC systems.

This project develops acoustic signal acquisition and processing techniques that preserve the privacy of everyone and everything that is susceptible to privacy violations due to continuous acoustic monitoring. The proposed collaborative research enables buildings to be retrofitted with a low-cost, acoustic sensing solution to monitor its HVAC systems to predict their impending failures. A major goal of this project is to reduce false positives when making these predictions that are primarily caused by inadequate modeling of sounds from a faulty component, inadequate modeling of different types of faults, and errors in sound source recognition. Furthermore, this project creates a foundation for the next generation of intelligent systems that autonomously monitor equipment and predict failure.<br/><br/>The project engages University of Florida and University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to augment research capability in conducting visualization-based dynamic assessment of HVAC systems, and building low-cost, embedded device-based centralized HVAC monitoring systems.

Creating interface materials with designed properties opens up untold degrees of freedom that may result in transformational evolutions in next generation electronics.<br/><br/>PARADIM's in-house research team will focus on developing hetero-interfaces that exhibit broken valley symmetry at interfaces between 2D materials and active substrates with novel electronic and magnetic functionality.  External researchers from across the U.S. also working to advance the next generation of electronic devices; specifically those researching valleytronics, spintronics, and multiferroics; will also have access to the Platform's growth capabilities and the expertise in synthesis, characterization, and theoretical modeling.  Along with access to mid-scale level tools and expertise, a unique feature of the Platform is the access to new oxide bulk single crystal samples and epitaxial thin film heterostructures produced and curated by PARADIM.  Signature mid-scale instruments of the Platform include a suite of specialty bulk single crystal growth instruments with in-situ characterization tools capable of growing manganites, ferrites, cobaltates, nickelates, ruthenates, iridates and other compelling oxide systems.  An MBE tool with unique in-situ diagnostic capabilities and a tandem MOCVD instrument for depositing non-oxide systems such as chalcogenides is also available.  The combination of instruments allows for the growth of a wide variety of inorganic systems, yielding crystals for fundamental studies, novel heterostructures exhibiting novel properties, and bulk substrates on which to grow unexplored thin film phases and structures.  In addition, the Platform makes available an impressive range of TEMs capable of high-throughput structural and chemical analysis as well as magnetic imaging and low-temperature spectroscopic mapping.  The research of external users and those of the PARADIM in-house team together create a community of researchers poised to make transformational gains in the accelerated discovery and deployment of new electronic materials, specifically enabling new oxide bulk single crystals and novel heterostructures.<br/><br/>Along with an annual REU program, PARADIM will offer hands-on research experiences for local undergraduates year-round in the crystal growth facilities.  In addition, educational materials will be available to users of PARADIM in the form of on-line short courses as well as a Materials-by-Design Toolbox that provides open-source software and databases to users on-line.  A signature outreach program will be the annual PARADIM Summer Schools, where graduate students, post-docs, young faculty, and industrial scientists are immersed in a seminar and hands-on workshop environment to learn techniques in bulk and thin film crystal growth, theory, and characterization.  Workshops will also be held that are industry focused.<br/><br/>http://www.paradim.cornell.edu <br/><br/><br/><br/>Non-Technical Abstract<br/>The Platform for the Accelerated Realization, Analysis, and Discovery of Interface Materials (PARADIM) will help users design and create new interface materials - materials that do not exist in nature - with unprecedented properties for the next generation of electronic devices.  Creating new interface materials with unprecedented properties, by design rather than by serendipity, is accomplished in PARADIM through a synergistic set of user facilities dedicated to theory (figuring out where to put the atoms for useful behavior), synthesis (putting the atoms in the targeted positions), and characterization (seeing that the atoms are indeed in the desired positions).  Each of these world-class user facilities is equipped with the latest tools, techniques, and expertise to realize this materials-by-design dream.  Users from throughout the nation will use PARADIM to discover and create interface materials for the next generation of electronics and optoelectronics.  These new materials will enable novel ways for electrons to carry information in solid-state devices and efficiently interact with magnetic, electrical, and optical stimuli.  To balance the desire for a rich nation-wide user group and the practicality of managing physical resources across different locations, PARADIM locates its web-based theory user facility at Clark Atlanta University, its bulk crystal growth user facility at Johns Hopkins University, and its thin film growth and characterization user facilities at Cornell University.  Researchers from Princeton University will participate in the in-house research activity.  PARADIM's user facilities leverage existing user facilities including the Cornell NanoScale Facility, the Cornell Center for Materials Research, and the Johns Hopkins Materials Characterization and Processing Facility. <br/><br/>In addition to training materials innovators to work effectively in teams, PARADIM will conduct free summer schools involving hands-on use of PARADIM facilities to help educate PARADIM's ""community of practitioners"" and advance the field through the cross-fertilization of ideas.  PARADIM will also serve as a focal point for training the next generation of technologists - people who are accustomed to designing and creating new interface materials with atomic precision and have the skills necessary to capitalize on useful new interface material ideas and make them a reality.  This platform marks the beginning of a new PARADIM in materials discovery.<br/><br/>http://www.paradim.cornell.edu"

Existing theoretical knowledge about the structure of optimal solutions to these problems is very sparse. Efficient algorithms for their solution are also non-existent. This project will develop a mathematically rigorous theoretical and computational framework to tackle countably infinite monotropic programs. This will ultimately help governments, non-profit organizations, and private institutions make better farsighted decisions, and thus benefit the US economy and society. The PI will provide research opportunities to students from his undergraduate classes and incorporate research findings into his graduate classes. The project will thus contribute to educating students in mathematics and engineering.<br/><br/>Finite-dimensional monotropic programs include linear programs, separable convex programs with linear constrains, and convex minimum cost network flow problems as special cases. Classic works of Minty and Rockafellar have revealed important connections between their geometric and analytical properties. Duality results for finite-dimensional monotropic programs are as powerful as those available for linear programs. These, in turn, have led to efficient solution algorithms. However, countably infinite extensions of such results have proven elusive owing to several mathematical pathologies in infinite-dimensional sequence spaces. The PI plans to overcome these hurdles by exploiting insights from his recent theoretical and algorithmic work on countably infinite linear programs. Specifically, the project will first provide three hypotheses for choosing primal and dual variable spaces so that weak duality and complementary slackness for countably infinite monotropic programs can be established via finite-dimensional proof techniques. It will then derive boundedness conditions under which strong duality in finite-dimensional approximations of countably infinite monotropic programs is preserved in the limit. The PI will also develop implementable approximations of infinite-dimensional extensions of classic finite-dimensional solution procedures such as descent algorithms, relaxation methods, and auction algorithms. These approximations will be adaptively designed to include a sufficient number of variables in reduced-cost and other calculations so as to guarantee monotone convergence to optimality. The resulting algorithms will be compared against a planning horizon benchmark that simply solves a sequence of larger and larger finite-dimensional approximations. This research will draw from and contribute to fundamental results in functional and convex analysis, and in infinite-dimensional linear algebra and combinatorics. It will also pave the way for future work on more general infinite-dimensional convex programs."

Despite their ubiquity, it remains poorly understood how habits are formed and maintained in the brain.  This research project will study how habits are represented in brain activity and how changing that activity can change habits.  Science generally lacks an understanding of how fluctuating patterns of brain activity control behaviors like habits because, until recently, tools were not available to manipulate those brain patterns.  Using cutting-edge techniques to do so, this work tests a central hypothesis that habits are controlled by the timing of brain activity related to when a habit is initiated and executed.  Specifically, prior studies have uncovered a burst of brain activity as a behavior starts that correlates with how habitual the behavior is.  This research evaluates how this pattern arises in the brain and whether it controls how habitual a behavior is by using tools to both monitor and manipulate the brain at the sub-second time-scale.  Results will provide a rich understanding of how habits arise out of precisely timed bursts of brain activity.  As part of this project, the cutting-edge research techniques are taught to undergraduate neuroscience students, which is a vital but lacking ingredient in their education.  These techniques, and the brain basis of habits in general, also are taught to grade-schools and the public through outreach activities to convey progress science is making on understanding habits.  Underrepresented individuals participate in all aspects of the research and outreach.<br/><br/>In the brain, the dorsolateral striatum (DLS) and its dopamine input from the substantia nigra have long been implicated in habits.  Neural recording studies have uncovered an activity pattern in these areas that characterizes habits, which involves a spiking burst at the start of behavior and diminished spiking mid-behavior.  These dynamics suggest that it is the timing of brain activity that helps dictate whether or not a learned behavior occurs habitually.  To test this, rats are exposed to lever-pressing and maze-running tasks that provide a screen of behavioral measures for habits.  Activity in the DLS is recorded using electrodes as animals form habits and then modify them.  Using optogenetics, in which DLS activity can be manipulated using pulses of light, the strength of the DLS activity is manipulated and consequences on habitual behavior and ongoing DLS dynamics assessed.  The first and second objectives are to test if the strength of DLS activity at the start of a behavior is sufficient and necessary for that behavior to be expressed as a habit and for habit-related DLS activity to be maintained over time.  The third objective is to test if start-related activity of dopamine input to the DLS is also critical for habits and for the start-related DLS activity that represents habits.  Collectively, this work answers a long-standing question of how step-to-step fluctuations in DLS activity guide a behavior towards habitual expression and will merge isolated behavioral and neuroscience approaches to do so."

The full-day event will take place on September 4, in conjunction with and immediately preceding the 2016 IEEE Symposium on Visual Languages and Human-Centric Computing (VL/HCC), to be held September 5-8 in Cambridge, UK, and sponsored by the IEEE Computer Society.  This year marks the 32nd anniversary of the Symposium.  Established in 1984, VL/HCC's mission is to support the design, formalization, implementation and evaluation of computing systems that are easier for a broader group of people to learn, use, and understand.  This includes research aimed at visual technology and text, and technology that uses sound, taste, virtual reality, and the Web.  It also includes research on theories about the many media used toward this goal.  VL/HCC occupies a unique niche among HCI and programming language conferences, in that it focuses specifically on how to help end users successfully develop and use software.  More information about the Symposium may be found online at https://sites.google.com/site/vlhcc2016/.  VL/HCC will be collocated this year with PPIG (Psychology of Programming Interest Group), which was established in 1987 in order to bring together people from diverse communities to explore common interests in the psychological aspects of programming and in the computational aspects of psychology.  Students who attend the VL/HCC Graduate Consortium will also have the opportunity to attend PPIG talks and interact with PPIG participants.  The PI and the members of the organizing committee will make special efforts to attract a diverse and interdisciplinary group of student participants, with special attention paid to recruitment of students from underrepresented institutions and women; to further increase diversity, no more than two student participants will be accepted from a given institution (and if two, then at least one of them must be from an under-represented group in STEM fields).<br/><br/>Recent advances in computing have led to continually deeper integration between computers and human society.  People now swim in a ""sea"" of socio-technical systems that synthesize large numbers of contributing users with vast amounts of source code.  Examples include social media systems, open source repositories, online marketplaces and massively multiplayer online games.  Yet as the socio-technical systems in this sea have grown in complexity, they have become increasingly difficult for end users to understand and direct toward productive ends.  The primary goal of this year's VL/HCC Doctoral Consortium, the 14th to be funded by NSF in this series, is to stimulate graduate students' thinking about how to use tools and techniques in the early stages of problem solving such as problem definition and solution searching.  In particular, what methods, models, diagrams, and tools can people leverage to create mental models of complex socio-technical systems that can be used to make design decisions and for collaboration?  Effective approaches will bring users and software together in creative and productive ways that bear directly on the needs of modern society.   The Doctoral Consortium will help shape ongoing and future research projects aimed at alleviating a pressing problem of relevance to a great many people within our society.  This event will promote discovery and learning, by encouraging the student researchers to explore a difficult and challenging open problem, through involvement of a panel of well-known researchers whose task is to provide constructive feedback, and through inclusion of other conference participants who will also learn from and provide additional feedback to the students and to each other.  The workshop will build community among young researchers working on different aspects of these problems from the perspectives of diverse fields including computer science, the social sciences, and education.  It will guide the work of these new researchers by providing an opportunity for experts in the research field (as well as their peers) to give them advice, in that student participants will make formal presentations of their work during the workshop and will receive feedback from a faculty panel.  The feedback is geared to helping students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to other human-computer interaction research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether the results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  As in prior years, the VL/HCC 2016 Doctoral Consortium will be part of the regular conference program, and a 2-page extended abstract of each participant's work will be published in the conference proceedings."

Jasmonate (JA) is the plant hormone that orchestrates these defense responses and dictates an inhibition of growth for plants under stress conditions. JA is also a powerful inducer of many specialized metabolites that have important ecological functions. These metabolites are also a renewable source of many high-value natural products for human use such as nutraceuticals. This project will elucidate how JA levels are precisely regulated to accommodate the various stress adaptive mechanisms of plants. The long term goal of this research is to help reduce or eliminate the need for chemical pesticides and to increase global food production through new approaches to pest control. This research promotes a better understanding of plant defense mechanisms, which can benefit both farmers and horticulturists. This project seeks to improve STEM education by providing multidisciplinary training to college students, graduates and postgraduates. Students from traditionally underrepresented groups in science will be sought through participation in the scientist's institutional outreach programs set up for that purpose. A science literacy program called Sci-LiFT (Science Literacy for Future Teachers) will be developed for students who are in training to become secondary school science teachers. Participating students will engage in real laboratory research on topics relevant to this project and develop a high school teaching module. The Sci-LiFT program is expected to leave an indelible mark on program participants and will positively impact their future teaching in secondary schools. <br/><br/>Although the core JA biosynthetic pathway has been delineated, how JA biosynthesis is initiated, maintained, or terminated is unclear. The major scientific goal of this project is to gain a better understanding of the termination of JA signal and to investigate its role in plant responses to wounding. Mutants were isolated that are defective in JA catabolism, and as a result, overaccumulate JA. Highly elevated JA concentration in these mutants was expected to constitutively activate JA-mediated defense responses. Contrary to this expectation, the mutants displayed opposite symptoms, becoming desensitized to JA, thus revealing an important link between JA catabolism and the plant?s long-term responses to stress conditions. This project will use a variety of mutants that are altered in endogenous JA profiles to investigate the dynamic relationship between the relative levels of JA derivatives and plant response to wounding in a well-established Arabidopsis genetic system. The specific aims of this project are: i) to determine the roles of JA turnover and oxidized-JA derivatives in plant response to wounding, ii) to delineate the signaling pathways important for wound response in JA catabolic mutants, and iii) to characterize the function of a new gene identified through a mutant screen for JA catabolism. The proposed project has the potential to identify previously unrecognized regulatory mechanisms of JA signaling and JA-dependent wound responses. This project is also expected to provide new information about how plants prioritize growth versus defense by studying the mutants that appear to defy the growth-defense-tradeoff rule."

Therefore, monitoring nitrogen and phosphorous species is important for water quality requirements for agricultural as well as energy recovery from waste streams. Currently these species are monitored via stationary monitoring stations. However nitrogen and phosphorous species move via agricultural run-off to other water systems, so portable sensors are needed that can change positionsin real time. This type of dynamic sensing requires suitable algorithms that can calculate appropriate sensor locations in real time in the face of inherent uncertainties in the fate and transport of the relevant species. To develop such an algorithmic framework to solve the problem of sensor placement in real time is the objective of this research.<br/><br/>This research is targeted to develop a fundamental understanding of the relationships involved in sensor placement and interaction with nutrient fate and transport of relevant species, with the goal of identifying the number and spatio-temporal positions of sensors for maximum effectiveness. Given that uncertainty is inherent, the problem of sensor placement will be formulated as a dynamic stochastic programming problem, the solution of which will be the dynamic optimal sensor deployment policy for nutrient monitoring in the face of uncertainties. Dynamic sensing with portable low cost sensors is a new area for nutrient monitoring which shows promise for food-water-energy nexus. This research will provide a theoretical basis for such an endeavor. This real time sensor placement problem will allow for the study of the spatial-temporal aspect of pollution which a constant monitoring station does not provide."

The doctoral student will provide new insights into how vegetative responses to past hydroclimate variability and disturbances can help protect and mitigate ecological communities against future environmental change.  An understanding of the climate processes associated with modern drought will provide deeper insights into past drought variability and the mechanisms that caused megadroughts evident in paleoecological records.  The student will work closely with local communities and government agencies by providing useful knowledge to resource managers regarding past hydroclimate variability and impacts to valuable natural resources.  In addition, the new insights into biodiversity dynamics associated with past megadroughts will inform policy-related discussions regarding ecological sustainability and land-management issues.  Results from this research would be useful for a broad range of uses, including species range modeling, predicting future ecosystem migration patterns in response to future climate change, and fire management in certain ecosystems.  As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this award also will provide support to enable a promising student to establish a strong independent research career.<br/><br/>Understanding the range of natural variability related to past drought and wet periods is important for providing context to water resource managers for future water planning.  The doctoral student whose dissertation research will be supported by this award will use modern climate data during past dry and wet events as analogs for the events seen in the sedimentary record.  The project will focus on two core questions:  (1) What were the prevailing seasonal atmospheric circulation patterns and surface conditions over western North America during the megadrought centered around 4,200 years BP?  (2) What were the prevailing seasonal atmospheric circulation patterns over western North America during the wet event that followed the megadrought?  In order to identify possible synoptic and dynamic patterns that may have caused these two events in the western U.S., the student will apply a modern climate analog technique, which is a conceptual model that uses modern extremes as analogs of past events.  To accomplish this, a composite of anomaly values for selected modern climate analog case years will be mapped and analyzed for their spatiotemporal variability of surface and atmospheric conditions."

The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration has predicted that the current warm-water El Niño event is especially strong and will likely bleach corals across the central and eastern Pacific during 2015-16.  Bleaching is most likely to occur in the central South Pacific, the location of the NSF-funded Moorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research (MCR LTER) site, starting in February 2016.  The proposed research will support field experiments and collection of key data at the MCR LTER site to address how the coming warm-water event interacts with nutrient pollution to influence the prevalence and intensity of coral bleaching.  The investigation will focus on two aspects: (1) island-wide patterns in bleaching and coral loss with respect to nutrient availability across the landscape, and (2) how different forms and sources of nitrogen-based nutrients can either facilitate or mitigate bleaching.  The project will assess the interaction of two major global change drivers on coral reefs, elevated sea surface temperature and nutrient pollution.  Results from this work can inform resource managers and policy makers regarding the effects of nitrogen enrichment in two different forms (nitrate vs. ammonium) from two different sources (human- vs. fish-derived) on altering the probability different types of corals will bleach during major warm-water events.  Human activities can enhance nitrate pollution directly, and lower ammonium enrichment indirectly (via fishing or destruction of nursery habitat), both of which might adversely affect corals by increasing the probability they will bleach.  As such, the project can provide much-needed information about how human   <br/>activities can impact coral reefs.  The project will contribute to the training of two graduate students who will participate in the field research.<br/><br/>Nutrient enrichment is a major anthropogenic force altering coastal ecosystems worldwide, particularly in oligotrophic systems such as coral reefs.  Based on differences in how ammonium versus nitrate enrichment affect the physiology of corals, some coral reef biologists have speculated that under stress, nitrate enrichment from anthropogenic sources should weaken the coral-dinoflagellate symbiosis, whereas recycled nitrogen excreted by reef fishes could be beneficial.  Thus, different forms of nitrogen (nitrate vs. ammonium) and different sources of nutrients (fish-derived vs. anthropogenic) can have fundamentally different effects on coral biology, which may lead to contrasting effects on how they alter the susceptibility of coral to bleaching from warm-water anomalies.  Further, spatial heterogeneity in nutrient availability could shape landscape scale patterns in the intensity of bleaching and subsequent community consequences.  This research will assess the interaction of two major global change drivers on coral reefs, elevated sea surface temperature and nutrient pollution.  Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) that nitrate enrichment from anthropogenic sources will increase the susceptibility of corals to bleaching, and (2) that nitrogen in the form of ammonium will reduce it.  Given that much of the N enrichment on the reefs in the lagoons of Moorea is of anthropogenic origin, the investigators further hypothesize that on a landscape scale, corals in more nutrient enriched sites will incur greater bleaching and bleaching-associated mortality compared to corals at nutrient poor sites.  These relationships will be explored for the three major genera in the Moorea system (Pocillopora, Acropora, Porites), and then scaled up to explore island-wide patterns of bleaching as a function of landscape scale heterogeneity in nutrient availability.  Crucial pre-bleaching data from field surveys and WorldView-3 satellite imagery will be paired with subsequent post-bleaching data to explore bleaching patterns in relation to gradients in nutrient availability on the reef complex.  In addition, a field experiment will be initiated prior to the warm-water anomaly to test the hypothesis that different forms of nitrogen will have contrasting effects on the likelihood of bleaching."

In particular, it will test the hypothesis that different species that evolve similar characteristics do so by changes in the same genes.  This hypothesis will be examined using species in the plant genus Penstemon that have independently evolved a similar suite of floral characters (e.g. long, narrow flowers, increased nectar production, lengthening of the reproductive organs) in response to pollination by hummingbirds.  If this hypothesis is true, then in different hummingbird-pollinated species, genes affecting a given character should be located at similar positions in the genome.  The project will test this expectation using genetic and genomic approaches applied to four hummingbird-pollinated species and closely related species pollinated by bees.  In addition, this research will determine the developmental basis (e.g. changes in cell size or cell proliferation) for the character changes.  In examining the main hypothesis, the project will sequence the genomes of three Penstemon species and provide genetic maps.  These resources will be made available to the scientific community.  The project will provide training for one postdoc and several graduate students in molecular and genomic techniques, as well as in bioinformatics and statistical analysis.  Finally, it will introduce undergraduate students to the sciences of evolutionary biology and genomics through internships and independent study with the PI and co-PI of the project, with a focus on minority student participation.<br/><br/>This project examines parallelism across different hierarchical levels (developmental vs. genetic), across different trait types within the pollination syndrome (quantitative vs. qualitative traits), and across different origins of flowers adapted to hummingbird pollination.  In doing so, it will provide the first extensive data specifically designed to determine the extent to which parallel phenotypic evolution of a complex multi-trait syndrome, comprised of multiple quantitative characters, evolved by parallel genetic and developmental mechanisms.  Penstemon species pairs representing four independent transitions from bee to hummingbird pollination floral syndromes will provide the foundation of this research.  For each of the four species pairs, the developmental differences that lead to divergent bee and hummingbird-adapted floral morphologies will be assessed to determine whether differences reflect parallel developmental processes.  For the same four species pairs, genetic mapping combined with genome sequencing will be used to assess whether quantitative floral trait loci identified in independent transitions to hummingbird pollination correspond to homologous genomic regions containing the same set of homologous candidate genes, suggestive that parallelism extends to the genetic level.  As few studies have examined genetic parallelism in quantitative traits, the project includes the development of a novel 'genetic parallelism score' to quantify the degree of genetic parallelism for both quantitative and qualitative traits.  Lastly, by quantifying developmental parameters in genetic lines derived from the mapping study, the project will link genetic and developmental processes by determining how fixed genetic differences between bee- and hummingbird-adapted species alter the specific developmental processes that contribute to divergent floral traits."

Lopez<br/>University of California-San Diego<br/><br/>What is citizenship? Most media attention around citizenship focuses on rights -- the right to live freely in a country, the right to trial by jury, the right to education, and the right to social security and other social welfare benefits -- and access to those rights by both citizens and non-citizens. But citizenship is also composed of obligations, duties citizens must fulfill to the state in order for citizenship to function. In order to guarantee the right to trial by a jury of one's peers, citizens must serve as jurors; taxes paid by citizens are necessary to fund social welfare programs. In an era of rights-centered rhetoric and policy, this project seeks to re-examine the true substance of citizenship by studying the four legally-enforceable U.S. citizenship obligations -- jury duty, taxation, military service (the draft), and K-12 education -- and evaluating their ongoing role in making citizenship viable. This project will reassert the relevance of citizenship obligations in understanding the true meaning, function, and value of citizenship as a whole. The findings from this project will help explain how citizenship obligations are created, who fulfills them, how they are related to citizenship rights, and their role in sustaining the citizenship regime. Furthermore, this project will improve our understanding the role of citizenship obligations in fostering citizen investment and engagement with the state, clarifying the steps that lawmakers and citizens should take in order to improve the citizenship experience.<br/><br/>Researchers of social movements, politics, national and international phenomena, migration, and the law have found that citizenship -- or ""the right to have rights"" bestowed by a state upon its members (Chief Justice Warren in Trop v. Dulles 1958) -- plays a key role in individual and group sense of belonging and the success of states. But as Chief Justice Warren's definition suggests, citizenship obligations have been greatly overshadowed in academic research and public discourse by citizenship rights, despite their equal significance in sustaining the citizenship relationship. Through a theoretically-grounded, mixed-methods research design, this project will examine the unique characteristics of each legally-enforceable U.S. citizenship obligation -- taxation, military service, jury duty, and education -- and their implications for citizenship theory and the citizenship experience. Utilizing a combination of quantitative, historical, and discourse analysis, this project will seek to answer the following questions, among others: How are citizenship obligations created and who fulfills them? Are citizenship obligations relevant in an age of rights and, if so, how? This project will address a gaping hole in the academic literature on citizenship. While most citizenship scholars have been content to ""understand"" citizenship as a whole from only the perspective of rights, this project will reassert the relevance of citizenship obligations in understanding the true meaning, function, and value of citizenship as a whole. The findings from this project will help explain how citizenship obligations are created, who fulfills them, how they are related to citizenship rights, and their role in sustaining the citizenship regime. This project provides both a theoretical and empirical case to the sociological cannon that will help answer some of the most basic questions about citizenship obligations, highlighting the importance of investigating both sides of the citizenship relationship. Furthermore, this project will improve our understanding the role of citizenship obligations in fostering citizen investment and engagement with the state, clarifying the steps that lawmakers and citizens should take in order to improve the citizenship experience and ensure its viability in the twenty-first century and beyond."

Maize can perceive and respond to adverse environmental conditions through a process called the unfolded protein response (UPR). Folding is a critical, but delicate step in the biosynthesis of proteins, and it can be easily upset by adverse conditions, such as high temperature. When this happens, misfolded proteins accumulate and activate a cascade of stress response genes. One of the objects of this project is to characterize in depth the cascade of genes to better understand how they protect maize from stress. Investigations in other plants has revealed that stress conditions eliciting the UPR also activate a process called autophagy in which plant cells repair stress damage. Therefore, another aim of this project is to discover how stress signals activate the autophagy machinery. In response to stress, other plants slow down protein synthesis to prevent overburdening the process of protein folding. In this project an investigation will be conducted to determine whether maize does this by degrading some of the messenger RNAs encoding proteins. Finally, attempts will be made to modify the UPR and probe more deeply into its operation by using new gene editing techniques. In parallel, there will be a focus on links between learning and research at the undergraduate level. This will be done through the development of easily accessible training on line and peer-support learning communities.<br/><br/>In this project, it is expected that new gene targets involved in ER stress responses in maize will be revealed through extensive transcriptomic analysis. It is anticipated that those targets may provide a clearer picture of both cell survival activities and cell death mechanisms in response to stress. In addition, these analyses will aid in uncovering the signaling pathways by which stress elicits the proliferation of the ER and activation of autophagy. While some UPR responses involve the upregulation of stress response genes, other responses result from the degradation of specific RNA transcripts brought about by Regulated IRE1-Dependent RNA Degradation (RIDD)and microRNA action. In this regard, the degradome as well as the transcriptome will be used to determine the role of selective RNA transcript degradation in maize stress responses. This research project is also expected to reveal through 'translateome' analysis whether ER stress is also mitigated in maize by selective and/or global regulation of the translation of RNA transcripts. A compelling reason for the selection of maize as a model for these studies is that the UPR has already been demonstrated in maize in the field. Therefore, variation in stress response in different lines of maize will be studied both in the laboratory and in the field with the goal of identifying genetic determinants that condition the UPR."

Features such as changes in life history, may be one explanation for the big differences among these rates. In insects, changes in diet, sociality, and mode of parasitism have been investigated for their impact on species formation.  However, very few groups of insects include species that have all of these life history traits, making it difficult to compare their individual impacts. The ants, wasps and bees (Aculeata) represent one such group; their numerous species exhibit a diversity of life histories.  The researchers will use new methods of genome sequencing to uncover the evolutionary relationships among the 65,000 described species of ants, wasps and bees. This research will provide important insights into differences in rates of speciation for a large group of organisms with sophisticated social systems (including ants, hornets, yellow jackets, honey bees and bumblebees) and the economically important group of pollinating insects (bees). This project will contribute significantly to the development of scientific expertise and improved infrastructure in the United States. It will provide training opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students, and post-doctoral researchers in sophisticated methods of DNA sequencing, bioinformatics, computer programming, and phylogenetic analysis. Protocols and data will be made publically available. The project will develop a traveling public exhibit on the biodiversity, evolutionary history, and importance of our most important agricultural pollinators (bees).<br/><br/>The research team will take advantage of new technological innovations in DNA sequencing to generate massive data sets for resolving the relationships of the Aculeata. Using highly conserved regions of the genome (ultraconserved elements) they will enrich genomic libraries for genes of interest. These enriched libraries will then be subjected to sequencing using the latest sequencing technologies. Using bioinformatics tools, the data sets will be assembled, aligned, and analyzed to reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among aculeate taxa and determine where and when shifts in diversification took place."

The Two-Dimensional Crystal Consortium Materials Innovation Platform (2DCC-MIP) at Pennsylvania State University (PSU) will advance the state of the art in the crystal growth of chalcogenides and two-dimensional (2D) thin film chalcogenides through transformational research and mid-scale investments in bulk crystal and thin film growth instrumentation.  The recent advent of new classes of 2D layered materials has created exciting opportunities in this context for fundamental scientific discovery and for transformative routes to high-impact technology.  The restricted electron motion in 2D films gives rise to new physical phenomena not present in three dimensions and new frontiers in computing, displays and communications that reach beyond current silicon-based electronics.  The Platform's in-house research team, housed at PSU, will focus on advancing our knowledge and understanding of synthetic routes and approaches that result in the application of 2D chalcogenide thin film systems in current electronic architectures and the next generation of electronic materials and devices.  External researchers from across the U.S. also working on next-generation electronic devices will have access to the Platform's growth capabilities and its expertise in synthesis, characterization, and theoretical modeling.  Along with access to mid-scale level tools and expertise, a unique feature of the Platform is the access to new chalcogenide bulk crystal samples and thin films produced and curated by the 2DCC-MIP.  At the heart of the Platform's synthesis capabilities are MOCVD and MBE tools with unique in-situ diagnostic capabilities.  In addition, several bulk crystal tools are available to grow a variety of chalcogenide systems, yielding crystals for fundamental studies, surfaces of new materials for exfoliating 2D films, and bulk substrates on which to grow unexplored thin film phases and structures.  To this end, 2DCC-MIP seeks to inspire and enable diverse new ideas and new researchers in 2D synthesis, supporting investigators nationwide at all career stages with capabilities that will transform their research.  The research activities of these external users and those of the 2DCC-MIP in-house team will together create a community of researchers poised to make transformational gains in the accelerated discovery and deployment of chalcogenide 2D materials.<br/><br/>The 2DCC-MIP will also serve as a leader in education and outreach, with several programs designed to disseminate the science and technology of 2D materials developed by the Platform.  2DCC-MIP will create and share a range of educational materials on various aspects of crystal growth and advanced characterization techniques accessible at the Platform or remotely.  A major activity will be the Grow With Us workshop designed to combine hands-on experience and seminars to transfer knowledge in exciting and emerging areas.  In addition, the Materials Research Facility Network Faculty Fellows and the STEP FORWARD programs will help faculty and student researchers gain access to the 2DCC-MIP shared facility.<br/>For more information, see www.mri.psu.edu/materials-innovation-platform<br/><br/><br/>Non-Technical Abstract<br/>The recent advent of new classes of two-dimensional (2D) layered materials has created exciting opportunities for fundamental scientific discovery and for transformative routes to high-impact technology at the frontiers of computing, displays, and communications that reaches beyond current silicon-based electronics.  The 2D Crystal Consortium Materials Innovation Platform  (2DCC-MIP) aims to develop a national resource to meet the synthesis challenges of two-dimensional (2D) chalcogenide materials.  Importantly, these 2D materials open up new fabrication approaches for flexible electronics and new routes to information technology beyond the present day confines of silicon CMOS. The full realization of the scientific and technological potential of these new 2D materials will require developing atomic-level mastery over the wafer-scale synthesis of samples with high crystalline quality and low defect densities.  Internal MIP research will develop synthetic capabilities that extend the state-of-the-art in both chemical vapor deposition and hybrid molecular beam epitaxy, thus enabling new ways to control nucleation and growth kinetics. These synthesis methodologies will be accompanied by a comprehensive suite of in-situ characterization techniques that probe materials from the atomic scale to the macroscale, guided by theoretical modeling of materials synthesis and predictive design of materials properties. External researchers from across the U.S. will be engaged to advance the frontiers of known chalcogenide materials, to accelerate discovery of new systems, to develop cost-effective processes for large-area single-crystal 2D films to transition toward commercialization, and to disseminate knowledge, samples, and techniques within a national user facility that acts as a hub for scientific cross-fertilization. <br/><br/>The ultimate goal of the 2DCC-MIP is to revitalize the science of crystal growth in the U.S.: this will be accomplished by combining compelling scientific capabilities with comprehensive user support and a suite of educational workshops, tutorials and webinars that serves a broad audience of students and academic, government and industrial researchers and fosters the growth and development of the nationwide community of researchers in the synthesis of 2D systems. Planned educational activities include monthly 2D research webinars, on-line tutorials on experimental and computational tools and techniques and an annual Grow with Us workshop that highlights emerging opportunities in the science and practice of crystal growth and thin film epitaxy. The 2DCC-MIP seeks to engage the full materials research community across academia and industry, and in particular, early career researchers and students and researchers at minority serving and primarily undergraduate institutions. The 2DCC-MIP will provide affordable access to unique equipment and computational tools, and deliver comprehensive support from science experts to a diverse group of users. <br/>For more information, see www.mri.psu.edu/materials-innovation-platform"

Off-shelf export of riverine water, and the material it contains, into the Gulf Stream has the potential to spread their signatures over large areas of the North Atlantic, and to potentially sequester riverine-derived carbon away from the surface into subsurface water of the subtropical gyre. However, standard in situ sampling only allows for relatively low resolution observations over relatively small areas, making it difficult to investigate distribution and export of low-salinity water, since those can occur in narrow filaments that are easily missed by in situ sampling. The combination of the in situ data and drifter trajectories with the recently-developed algorithm to retrieve salinity in the region will allow for comparisons between normal years-the project has an extensive data set collected during seven research cruises, and an extreme year in terms of river discharge associated with one of the strongest El Nino events in the last 70+years. This project will promote education by supporting one graduate and one undergraduate student. Findings from this research project will also be disseminated in the LTER Schoolyard Program that is organized every summer by the NSF-funded Georgia Coastal Ecosystem Long-Term Ecological Research site in which science and math K-12 teachers from across the State of Georgia are immersed in hands-on research activities and discussions on coastal processes. Training K-12 teachers will maximize the dissemination of the knowledge to a large audience, since each teacher has the opportunity to interact with a large number of students from across the State. All data sets generated as part of this project will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>This project will examine the offshore export of riverine water in the shallow and broad continental shelf of the South Atlantic Bight (SAB) during the strong El Nino currently underway, which is on track to rival the strength of the 1997/1998 event. River discharge in the SAB is strongly influenced by El Ninos, with the highest discharge ever recorded at the Altamaha River having occurred during the strong 1997/98 event. Discharge in early 2016 is already two standard deviations above the long-term average for the same period, indicating that the SAB will likely receive very high river flow during spring 2016. This provides a once-in-many-decades opportunity to investigate transport pathways and the mechanisms controlling the offshore export of riverine water over the shelf under extreme conditions. The project's investigators will take advantage of a research cruise of opportunity in spring 2016 and use a combination of in situ data and a recently-developed algorithm to retrieve salinity from satellite observations. The data set will be complemented by multiple surface drifter deployments at the Altamaha River mouth and along a cross-shelf transect extending from the inner shelf to the slope. The distribution and export of riverine water over the shelf in 2016, under extreme conditions associated with El Nino, will be compared with the distribution and export in 2014, when discharge was near the historical average and an extensive data set was collected during seven research cruises in the region. The role played by eddies and winds on cross-shelf transport of riverine water will also be assessed and compared for the past two years."

As data become more open and transportable, a second layer of research output has emerged, linking research publications to the associated data, possibly along with its provenance.  This trend is rapidly followed by a new third layer: communicating the process of inquiry itself by sharing a complete computational narrative that links method descriptions with executable code and data, thereby introducing a new era of reproducible science and accelerated knowledge discovery.  In the Whole Tale (WT) project, all of these components are linked and accessible from scholarly publications. The third layer is broad, encompassing numerous research communities through science pathways (e.g., in astronomy, life and earth sciences, materials science, social science), and deep, using interconnected cyberinfrastructure pathways and shared technologies. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to strengthen the second layer of research output, and to build a robust third layer that integrates all parts of the story, conveying the holistic experience of reproducible scientific inquiry by (1) exposing existing cyberinfrastructure through popular frontends, e.g., digital notebooks (IPython, Jupyter), traditional scripting environments, and workflow systems; (2) developing the necessary 'software glue' for seamless access to different backend capabilities, including from DataNet federations and Data Infrastructure Building Blocks (DIBBs) projects; and (3) enhancing the complete data-to-publication lifecycle by empowering scientists to create computational narratives in their usual programming environments, enhanced with new capabilities from the underlying cyberinfrastructure (e.g., identity management, advanced data access and provenance APIs, and Digital Object Identifier-based data publications).  The technologies and interfaces will be developed and stress-tested using a diverse set of data types, technical frameworks, and early adopters across a range of science domains."

After production in the leaves, the sugar needs to be moved to other parts of the plant where this energy is consumed. These consuming tissues are termed 'sinks'. Analogous to our circulatory systems, plants have a network of cells called the phloem that allow the movement of sugars from source (leaves) to the sink tissues.  Scientists have long sought to increase the yield of crops by regulating the movement of sugars, the theory being that if supplies are increased, yield can be increased while the input of costly and environmentally problematic fertilizers is diminished. Previous work has identified a transporter within the phloem and this proposal aims to characterize the function of this key regulator in sugar transport.  Specifying how this transporter moves sugar to various tissues within the plant will allow scientists to develop strategies to optimize sugar translocation in crops that increase yield while reducing the environmental impacts of production agriculture. The Hispanic roots of the lead scientist for this project give this team an edge in engaging Hispanic audiences by communicating complex scientific topics in Spanish to ignite interest in science among the general public and among students. The scientists involved in this project will organize an international meeting on agricultural biotechnology and society, and will also develop bilingual web-based teaching tools to promote scientific literacy.<br/><br/>The partitioning of photoassimilates between their sites of production and utilization is a key determinant of plant growth and development. Emerging evidence suggests regulation of photoassimilate partitioning is mediated in part by a type I H+-PPase. A role for this transporter has been established at the tonoplast; however, this exclusive function has been unsettled by recent work showing plasma membrane (PM) localization of this transporter and establishing that it is prominently expressed in phloem companion cells (CC). The researchers propose this enzyme has two opposing roles, PPi hydrolysis and synthesis that contribute to a cascade of events that energize plant growth. They will test the capacity of the Arabidopsis thaliana H+-PPase to synthetize PPi in a heterologous system (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and in plants. Concurrently, a series of genetic, immunohistochemical and physiological experiments will determine how this pump affects the partitioning of assimilates. This fundamental research will catalog that H+-PPases as a central mediator involved in the allocation and metabolism of photosynthates."

The aim of this program of research is to understand the prevalence and causes of opposition, especially moral opposition, to genetically modified (GM) food. This research program provides immediate insight into why individuals are opposed to GM food. It also illuminates how to begin a productive discussion about the role of genetic engineering in the modern world, as well as the consequences of moral beliefs for science communication more broadly. <br/><br/>A wealth of research has been devoted to understanding the causes of opposition to GM food. Generally, this research has focused on rational or quasi-rational factors, such as beliefs about GM food's risks and benefits, trust in GM food-related institutions, and scientific literacy. This approach (which implicitly assumes that consumers usually reason about costs and benefits to arrive at their attitudes) remains the dominant paradigm in the study of attitudes towards GM food. The present work expands the scope of explanations of opposition to GM by applying established theories about sacred values and the law of contagion. The researchers examine whether some opposition to GM food is a manifestation of moral, sacred values, i.e., moral opposition, and whether this opposition is related to perceptions that the process of genetic modification is disgusting and contaminating. In a survey study with a representative sample, the research assess the prevalence and correlates of moral and non-moral opposition to GM food. In follow up experiments, the research manipulates factors related to sacred values and contagion and examines the impact on moral and non-moral opponents attitudes. This framework explains otherwise surprising phenomena observed in GM opposition research, e.g., insensitivity to evidence about risks and benefits of GM and generates novel predictions about factors affecting GM attitudes, e.g., the impact of disgust and arguments grounded on moral principles."

The goal of this project is to develop and test a new technique, known as MRF-X, to probe in vivo tissue microstructure by using standard Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) scanners to collect data in a new way. After optimizing the MRF-X method, the properties of both skeletal muscle and brain tissue will be measured, and differences between healthy and abnormal tissue quantified. This technique will enable researchers to study how diseases progress as well as allow physicians to examine tissue microstructure to better diagnose disease in their patients.  <br/><br/>The goal of this five-year project is to develop, validate, and deploy novel techniques for in vivo tissue microstructure characterization. These tissue microstructure measurements will be performed by collecting Magnetic Resonance (MR) imaging data that have been encoded to contain information about multiple tissue properties simultaneously in a manner similar to the recently introduced MR Fingerprinting technique. By optimizing the MR pulse sequence to be sensitive to variations between tissue compartments, it will be possible to collect information about microstructure which cannot currently be measured directly in vivo, including water exchange rates between tissue compartments and intracellular/extracellular volume fractions.  The specific objectives of the proposal are to: 1) Develop a technique (MRF-X) for rapid and robust in vivo quantification of volume fractions and exchange properties, 2) Characterize and validate water exchange rates and volume fraction in healthy skeletal muscle and brain tissue, 3) Explore the use of water exchange as a biomarker for disease in the brain by comparing properties of normal brain tissue and multiple sclerosis (MS) lesions, and 4) Develop formal course work and laboratory experiences linking signal processing and medical imaging for undergraduate and graduate students, introduce K-12 students to biomedical imaging and engineering, and encourage women and underrepresented minorities to pursue science and engineering. The proposed research plan involves the development of new imaging techniques with the goal of addressing fundamental questions about the nature of interactions between tissue compartments and how they are modified under pathological conditions. Using MRF-X, it will be possible to explore tissue structure and function in healthy living tissue, and also to use these new biomarkers to aid in the understanding and diagnosis of disease. The development of a robust and rapid technique for in vivo tissue microstructure characterization will ensure that the technique is immediately translatable for clinical use, potentially leading to earlier and more accurate diagnosis of disease. Moreover, it will be possible to probe the underlying mechanisms of various diseases, including but not limited to Alzheimer?s disease and MS, using MRF-X. The education and mentorship of K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students will be integrated into the research to engage students, especially women and underrepresented minorities, in biomedical imaging.<br/><br/><br/>This award was made by the Biomedical Engineering program of CBET was co-funded by the Mathematical Biology program of the Division of Mathematical Sciences."

Another goal of this research is to utilize collections of frozen tissue collected over the past two decades to test for physiological health and genetic state of the individuals that comprise both healthy and declining populations. Ultimately, this research will result in a better predictive power about how animals move across their landscapes, utilize resources, and persist in the wild by taking into consideration the physiological and genetic signatures of individuals. The PI's undertakings will involve many high school and college students, as well as graduate students working towards their master-of-science or doctorate degrees. <br/><br/>Sweeping anthropogenic changes to environmental landscapes in the late 20th and early 21st centuries pose urgent challenges to organisms and their populations. Potential organismal responses to unsuitable and disintegrating habitats are to move, perish, acclimate ecologically, or adapt evolutionarily. Predicting among these population outcomes requires long-term studies in which species, demography, physiology, ecology, and genetic variability have been monitored before as well as during a period of habitat change. The PIs will couple long-term spatial and temporal data, spanning 1976 to present, on variation in physiological processes and life-history traits with genetic markers of population health to develop a framework for integrating physiology, genetics, and demography in predicting responses of populations facing habitat degradation. Furthermore they will couple measures of individual state variables (physiological plasticity, genotype, and fitness measures) to link individual-level states and heterogeneity among individuals to population-level demography. They will accomplish these goals of measuring longterm heath indices by mining or longterm tissue and DNA collections on replicate populations of garter snakes inhabiting the northeastern Sierra Nevada mountain range. To accomplish the synthetic goals, mathematical models with structural equation modeling and additional modeling approaches will be developed and utilized. This will result in a fully-linked model of the relationships among physiological and genetic variation, organismal life-history variation, and environmental variation."

Yet the relationship between activism and insurgent mobilization is not well understood. This project seeks to explain how insurgent movements work to undermine activists' commitment to their organizations, and why certain civic organizations are more vulnerable to rebel recruitment drives than are others. It also traces how activists who do leave peaceful forms of activism for violent rebellion might leverage personal and professional relationships with other activists and their beneficiaries to bring greater numbers of individuals into the insurgent fold, thereby transforming the resources of civic activism into the resources for violent rebellion. In so doing, this project will provide guidance to activists and policymakers wishing to protect and promote the development of civil society in deeply-divided societies at risk of, or already experiencing, violent internal conflict.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>Based on nine months of in-depth fieldwork comparing Maoist recruitment efforts amongst ethnic organizations during Nepal's civil war (1996-2006), this research will assess a number of factors that impact activists' commitment to their organizations, and thus each organization's relative vulnerability to rebel recruitment efforts. Relying primarily on semi-structured interview and focus group testimonies with activists and beneficiaries, as well as with former insurgents, the project will examine how factors such as the scope and type of an activist organization's activities, its structure, and the material rewards of activism impacted activists' commitment to their organizations. It will also assess how insurgents chose organizations and activists to target for recruitment, and how they worked to undermine existing commitment. Finally, this research will trace how initial activist defections to the rebel group may have triggered cascades of defection through organizational networks as other activists and beneficiaries sharing ties with early defectors followed suit."

Hybridization can have a range of outcomes.  Most frequently, hybridization results in loss of fitness (hybrid breakdown), effectively reducing interbreeding and promoting the formation of new species. Occasionally, however, novel combinations of genes yield ecological advantages to hybrids, including adaptation to new ecological niches.  What attributes of parental populations predict the outcome of hybridization? Answering this question is the focus of this project, and will provide new insights into the effects of climate and ecological changes on adaptation rates and species formation. The researchers also will engage in novel public informal education at the Birch Aquarium and in hands-on experiences in marine biology for 5th grade students in underserved San Diego neighborhoods. <br/><br/>Predicting hybridization outcomes requires an understanding of the molecular basis of hybrid phenotypes. This project will conduct genomic analyses of hybrids produced by crosses between divergent populations of the copepod Tigriopus californicus.  Previous work has shown that energy production by mitochondria is frequently disrupted in hybrids.  Whole genome sequencing will be used to determine genetic differences between groups of hybrid copepods with normal versus disrupted mitochondrial performance; differentiation between the groups will identify candidate genes that are potentially responsible for hybrid breakdown. Results will address: a) Does hybridization result in widespread incompatibilities across the genome, or can targeted genes be identified? b) Are the same genomic regions responsible for hybrid breakdown in different interpopulation crosses?  A similar approach will be used to examine the genomic basis of improved hybrid thermal tolerance.  What genetic interactions allow some hybrids to survive temperatures that are lethal to both parental populations?  Is hybrid performance predictable from genetic or ecological differences between parental populations?"

In each community, within a few years and with high accuracy, children learn the language of their environment. Achieving high proficiency in at least one language is critical for learning the culture of the community, connecting with peers, and accessing an education. When language is delayed, other aspects of development may also be at risk. Studying how language develops in children is therefore of great importance, both for understanding how language interacts with other systems, and for identifying and diagnosing language delays. Although children learn language quickly, they continue to make some errors well after they achieve high proficiency in their first language. These errors, because they are so rare, provide useful insights into the mechanisms of language development. Many of the general cognitive processes proposed to interact with language in adults are known to develop much later than language, raising the question: to what extent are children's linguistic errors due to extra-linguistic processes, rather than incomplete linguistic knowledge?<br/><br/>This research uses children's understanding of adjunct control, as in ""John bumped Mary after tripping on the sidewalk,"" as a case study to investigate this question. For this sentence, adults only access a meaning in which John tripped, while children have been reported to exhibit a much wider range of interpretations, in which John, Mary or anyone tripped. All accounts to date of adjunct control in children have cited incomplete knowledge as the source of children's interpretations; this research pursues an alternative account--that children's knowledge is complete, but the extra-linguistic processing mechanisms are more error-prone in children than in adults, masking children's knowledge in contexts with a high processing load. Based on the manipulations used with similar types of sentences in adult sentence processing, this research investigates the effects of processing load on children's interpretations of sentences with adjunct control. At stake is a more continuous account that relates children's errors for adjunct control to parallel effects in adults, and presents the opportunity for future research to investigate other sentence types, the development of processing mechanisms, and how immature processing mechanisms affect language development. This research also includes an outreach component to local families and high schools, and will provide research experience to an undergraduate research assistant."

This research project examines how the local, host population is affected by an influx of refugees, specifically with regards to host citizens' national identity, demand for state-provided public goods and services, and preferences over immigration policies. The research examines whether or not refugees may strengthen nearby native citizens' national identity and solidarity. It involves a survey with citizen respondents in Tanzania, a country with an extensive history of hosting various refugee groups. This survey will compare attitudes and behaviors of citizens living in refugee-hosting districts to those in similar districts without refugees.<br/><br/>More technical description:<br/><br/>How do refugees impact their local, host environments? This research project theorizes that the exogenous shock of forced migration may have unintended yet positive consequences for nationalism and nation-building in the host country. Refugees may strengthen nearby native citizens' nationalism as national identity is the obvious point of difference between natives and refugees. Additionally, the influx of international and government aid into refugee camps often stands in contrast to the lack of local public goods in nearby host communities. Refugees, by challenging national borders and highlighting inequalities in welfare, can inadvertently spur host citizens to rally around their national identity and better cooperate in providing and demanding for public goods and services. The survey randomly varies the level of salience of refugees and uses new methods to measure the complex dimensions of national identity and migrant threat."

Among many others, the linear programming (LP) technique has played a central role in the area of approximation algorithms.  This project seeks to understand the power of this technique, by exploiting a very flexible paradigm in designing LP-based algorithms, called the ""round-or-cut"" paradigm.  The PI aims to use this paradigm to tackle many combinatorial optimizations problems that seem hard to tackle in other ways.  Successful completion of the project will not only yield improved approximation algorithms for these problems, but also lead to a better understanding of the power of linear programming technique. As a part of the project, undergraduate and graduate students will be trained and involved in the research activities. The course materials resulting from this research project will be made freely accessible online.<br/><br/>Recently, the round-or-cut paradigm has led to many improved approximation algorithms.  This paradigm differs from the traditional ""relax-and-round"" paradigm in that the LP relaxation used to approximate the problem does not need to be efficiently solvable.  As a result, the round-or-cut paradigm has the flexibility that the rounding algorithm can adaptively choose the set of linear constraints to require the fractional solution to satisfy. The major goal of this project is to leverage this flexibility to tackle problems that seem hard to tackle using the traditional relax-and-round paradigm, including the capacitated k-median problem, the machine minimization problem on identical machines, and the unsplittable flow problem on paths.  The second goal is to understand the gap between the round-or-cut paradigm and the traditional relax-and-round paradigm. So far, the relax-and-round paradigm is far more popular than the round-or-cut paradigm in designing LP-based approximation algorithms. For a few problems only, algorithms require the stronger round-or-cut paradigm. The PI will investigate whether the relax-and-round paradigm is sufficient for these problems."

It supports theoretical research and education on proteins and cellular membranes. Cell membranes are one of the fundamental hallmarks of life. For many of their biological functions, cell membranes rely on the collective properties of lattices of interacting membrane proteins. The primary research objective of this project is to build, based on methods from condensed matter physics and materials science, a novel theoretical framework which captures the physical mechanisms underlying the fluctuations, shape, and collective function of membrane protein lattices observed in cell membranes. The principal investigator and his team will closely collaborate with experimental groups to test and refine this theoretical framework for both integral and peripheral membrane proteins, and to thereby discover and describe the general physical principles underlying key biological functions of cell membranes through two parts:<br/><br/>(1) Integral membrane proteins are crucial for the exchange of molecules and signals between cells and their environment. The function of integral membrane proteins is often regulated by lipid bilayer mechanical properties and cooperative interactions, as exemplified by mechanosensitive ion channels and chemoreceptors. Based on these two model systems, the PI aims to develop a general physical theory which can predict how bilayer-protein interactions, lipid heterogeneity, and thermal fluctuations relate to the collective functions of integral membrane protein lattices observed in cell membranes. This will provide theoretical tools needed to connect the classic theory of bilayer-protein interactions to in vivo data on the architecture and collective function of integral membrane protein lattices.<br/><br/>(2) Peripheral membrane proteins allow cells to regulate membrane shape, which is essential for many cellular processes. It remains largely unknown how peripheral membrane proteins interact to produce large-scale transitions in membrane shape. Recent experiments on the N-BAR protein endophilin have revealed a structural switch in lipid bilayer-endophilin interactions which generates distinct membrane shapes. Based on these experiments, the PI plans to establish a general theory which captures the physical mechanisms underlying endophilin-induced lipid bilayer deformations, and the architecture and shape of endophilin lattices. This activity is aimed to provide the foundation for a quantitative understanding of how bilayer-protein interactions are regulated to produce transitions in membrane shape during endocytosis and other fundamental biological processes.<br/><br/>The interdisciplinary research carried out in this project will inform a range of interdisciplinary education and outreach activities, which will develop novel teaching approaches and materials integrating physics and biology at the level of high school, undergraduate, and graduate education."

Friction is the resistance to sliding between two solid surfaces that are in mechanical contact. These mechanisms operate at sub-micrometer length scales and involve complex mechanical interactions that are dictated by the surfaces' adhesion and roughness. The specifics of these mechanisms, however, remain poorly understood. The new knowledge will lead to new strategies that can reduce energy wastage, for example in engines, due to friction. Additionally, the new knowledge in alliance with micro-fabrication techniques will allow engineers to create surfaces with tailored or tunable surface properties. Specifically, it will inform them which sizes, shapes and arrangements of surface features should be used in order to produce the desired frictional effects. Such ""structural surface engineering"" has the potential to galvanize scientific and technological breakthroughs in many disciplines. For example, it can drive the development of prosthetics that are capable of the human sense of touch, and increase the agility of the next generation of climbing robots for search and rescue missions.<br/><br/>The new knowledge will be derived by investigating the hypothesis that a significant fraction of friction involving elastomeric material surfaces is caused by the energy dissipated by mechanical instabilities that take place at the small-scale due to adhesion and surface roughness. The hypothesis will be investigated by studying a model family of continuum mechanics-based contact problems. Equations that connect the mean transverse contact force to the net normal contact force, adhesion and roughness parameters will be derived. By performing an asymptotic analysis of these equations it will be determined whether the mean transverse force remains finite, that is, whether friction type behavior emerges at the large-scale, as the roughness length scale in the problem is made infinitesimally small. New adhesive contact simulation techniques and experiments will be developed and used to guide and verify the theoretical work. Currently, surface mechanical phenomena, such as friction, are considered intrinsic properties and are described with phenomenological models. There is a very limited understanding of how surface phenomena are connected to small-scale mechanisms and parameters. The project aims to derive a micro-mechanics based, mathematical theory of friction. It will lead to fundamental advances required for creating a general, theoretical methodology for understanding how surface properties emerge at the large-scale as the smeared out effects of complex interactions that are hidden at the small-scale."

Hybridization can have a range of outcomes.  Most frequently, hybridization results in loss of fitness (hybrid breakdown), effectively reducing interbreeding and promoting the formation of new species. Occasionally, however, novel combinations of genes yield ecological advantages to hybrids, including adaptation to new ecological niches.  What attributes of parental populations predict the outcome of hybridization? Answering this question is the focus of this project, and will provide new insights into the effects of climate and ecological changes on adaptation rates and species formation. The researchers also will engage in novel public informal education at the Birch Aquarium and in hands-on experiences in marine biology for 5th grade students in underserved San Diego neighborhoods. <br/><br/>Predicting hybridization outcomes requires an understanding of the molecular basis of hybrid phenotypes. This project will conduct genomic analyses of hybrids produced by crosses between divergent populations of the copepod Tigriopus californicus.  Previous work has shown that energy production by mitochondria is frequently disrupted in hybrids.  Whole genome sequencing will be used to determine genetic differences between groups of hybrid copepods with normal versus disrupted mitochondrial performance; differentiation between the groups will identify candidate genes that are potentially responsible for hybrid breakdown. Results will address: a) Does hybridization result in widespread incompatibilities across the genome, or can targeted genes be identified? b) Are the same genomic regions responsible for hybrid breakdown in different interpopulation crosses?  A similar approach will be used to examine the genomic basis of improved hybrid thermal tolerance.  What genetic interactions allow some hybrids to survive temperatures that are lethal to both parental populations?  Is hybrid performance predictable from genetic or ecological differences between parental populations?"

The study surveys a nationally representative sample of U.S. residents, then re-surveys them at a later time.  This enables the investigators to study risk perceptions relating to domestic terrorism and, particularly, how those risk perceptions increase or decrease over time. The survey measures a number of characteristics associated with perceptions of various types of terrorism attacks, including so-called lone-wolf attacks. The second survey will measure the same characteristics approximately six months after the first survey. The combined data from the two surveys will contribute to a better understanding of the correlates of risk perceptions of terrorist events and how and why those perceptions change over time. Better understanding of the specific and potentially unique risk and threat perceptions associated with lone-wolf terrorist attacks has implications for public policy and institutional responses.<br/><br/>More specifically, the project will employ a two-wave panel survey of risk perceptions relating to domestic terrorism among a nationally representative sample of U.S. residents.

Although many have written about Africa's rising middle class in recent years, they ignore the continued importance of Africans' obligations to financially support family members and friends in the absence of strong government welfare systems. These financial obligations create a paradox: as individuals rise economically, they must spend more money supporting dependent family and friends. Focusing on Ghana, a country with both a growing middle class and a growing commercial finance sector, this research seeks to answer two questions: how do individuals from different socio-economic backgrounds interpret and fulfill their obligations differently? Second, how do Ghanaians' obligation management strategies affect their socio-economic outcomes? The research draws together insights from history, anthropology, and sociology to contribute to scholars' understanding of the economic dimensions of personal relationships in different cultures, as well as social stratification in contemporary sub-Saharan Africa, an area of the world often overlooked by sociologists. This research has implications for development policy and planning in other developing countries, where efforts to provide formal financial services for ""unbanked"" residents are growing, and where economic opportunities are multiplying but unevenly distributed. <br/><br/>This dissertation examines the relationship between personal relationships, financial obligations, and socio-economic outcomes in countries where the government welfare system is limited and patronage relationships still serve as a primary means of resource distribution. Focusing on Ghana, an African country with both a growing middle class and a growing commercial finance sector, the study asks two questions: how do individuals from different socio-economic backgrounds interpret and fulfill their obligations differently?that is, how do Ghanaians of various economic means practice different obligation management strategies? Second, how might different obligation management strategies affect Ghanaians' socio-economic outcomes? The research employs two primary methods. First, a 300-person vignette survey of urban Ghanaians will examine the diversity of norms surrounding financial obligations and obligation management strategies among Ghanaians from different socio-economic backgrounds. Second, 60 in-depth follow-up interviews with low-, middle-, and high-income respondents will provide more detailed data on respondents' social networks and economic strategies. The research extends knowledge of how contemporary Africans both exploit and/or resist the demands of patrons and clients in a patronage-based society. Additionally, it highlights the role of institutional context in mediating the connection between personal relations and economic outcomes. Understanding how relational obligations affect individuals' and families' own economic advancement will illustrate the difficulties of managing relations and resources in a developing society where economic opportunities are multiplying but unevenly distributed."

This support is generally provided by the staff of full time technicians at the operating institutions in the Academic Fleet. During periods when the support demands are greater than the available personnel, the institution hires or borrows (from another operating institution) additional technicians on an ad hoc basis. Conversely, when an institution has a weak schedule, the size of the technical support staff does not adjust and technicians may be underutilized. The NSF, in conjunction with the Technical Support Manager at the UNOLS office, has instituted a process whereby the exchange of full-time technicians between Ship Operating Institutions can occur without the burden of sending invoices and payment between institutions. <br/><br/>The next step in this process is the establishment of a fleet-wide Technician Pool where a portion of the sea-going workforce is comprised of non-institution-specific, contract personnel that are utilized as needed.

To more efficiently manage the personnel resources in the fleet in the face of level or shrinking budgets.<br/>NSF is aware that many institutions have HR policies that make it difficult to hire temporary/part time employees.

Chinese state-run media emphasize the prosperous outlook for these returnees and the state's recognition of their importance for the country's transition to a knowledge economy. As Chinese cities compete to attract talented returnees, little is known about how the municipal strategies work and what roles returning skilled labor indeed play in Chinese cities' development. This dissertation research studies the ways in which Chinese cities recruit U.S.-educated Chinese talent to achieve their goal of stimulating urban development, and how these recruitment initiatives in turn affect the migration decisions and reincorporation experiences of the targeted returnees. This study addresses three questions: 1) how Chinese cities, in the hope of becoming global, recruit U.S.-trained Chinese talent back for development projects 2) how these recruitment programs affect the migration decisions of U.S-educated Chinese talent in the U.S. and the reincorporation experiences of the returnees in China 3) how the disjunctures between the ways the local Chinese state and the returnees conceptualize ""value"" and ""contribution"" influence the ways in which they interact with each other. To examine these themes, the researchers will conduct a case study of a major city in eastern China and utilize semi-structured interviews, participant observation and secondary analysis as the main methods of investigation. <br/> <br/>This study has the following potential impacts. Firstly, it will contribute to social science research on urban development, global cities, and transnational migration by presenting a critical case for understanding the complexities of urban development in the neoliberal era and demonstrating how specific state development policies affect the relocation and settlement patterns of highly skilled professionals. Secondly, this study will provide implications for policy makers and urban planners. The findings will help cities that fiercely compete with each other in a globalizing world to better understand how the strategies of attracting talent work in practice and if these strategies do foster development. Moreover, this project will inform how to retain a highly competitive workforce that is globally mobile in nature in the contemporary era. As highly-skilled immigrants from Asia consist of an increasing part of the overall immigration to the U.S., it is essential for U.S. policy makers to understand these processes in order to make informed decisions about immigration reform in general and about policies to attract and retain highly skilled immigrants in particular."

Recently, extracellular ATP was suggested to come into play in plant defense responses. Understanding molecular mechanisms that control ATP-induced defense signaling will help identify potential molecular targets to engineer disease resistance into crop plants; this development will not only improve the yield and quality of biomass but it will also reduce the need for added chemicals to control plant disease. Thus, the project is poised to bring significant economic, environmental, and social benefits by preventing pollution in the environment and reducing input costs for producers. The project includes the education and training of post-doctoral researchers and students. Moreover, the project will integrate research and education by providing summer research projects to high school students. A strong emphasis will be placed on recruitment and training of underrepresented groups, especially for the high school summer intern and undergraduate student positions. This training will offer students a potentially empowering and educational glimpse into scientific research, and prepare them for future careers in science. In conclusion, the proposed project integrates research and education to achieve beneficial results for education, agriculture and the environment.<br/><br/>The energy currency molecule, ATP, is released into the extracellular space following cellular damage, where it acts as a danger signal for damaged-self recognition in multicellular organisms. Very recently, the first plant purinoceptor, P2 Kinase (P2K), was identified, and further suggested the involvement of extracellular ATP in the plant defense responses to wounding or damage from infectious organisms. However, how the signaling pathway connects to the plant defense response after ATP binding to the P2K receptor is unknown. The long-term goal is to develop an in-depth understanding of the molecular mechanisms mediating extracellular ATP signaling during plant defense responses. The immediate objective is to determine how P2K receptor-mediated ATP signaling regulates plant defense responses. The project?s aims are: (1) Elucidation of sensing mechanism of extracellular ATP by the P2K receptor; (2) Identification and functional analysis of molecular components that act downstream of the P2K receptor; (3) Identification and characterization of signaling networks between extracellular ATP and other stress hormone signaling pathways, so as to elucidate the role of extracellular ATP in plant defense response. This research is crucial to understanding how plants survive pathogen and herbivore attacks as well as giving the researchers a unique opportunity to compare animal and plant purinergic signaling systems, in order to define components and responses that are evolutionarily conserved."

First, interest groups possess specialized policy information that legislators need, and, second, lobbying strategies have grown more sophisticated in the last couple decades. Using an original dataset of lobbying expenditures in thirty-two state legislatures between 2001 and 2014, this project will tests how party conditions (polarization, cohesion, and majority party seat share) affect lobbying expenditures. The expected relationship between each of these conditions and lobbying expenditures depends on what interest groups do when they lobby. If groups lobby only when they believe they can change legislator beliefs about policy, then interest groups should spend less on lobbying as legislator beliefs become more fixed, i.e., as the legislature grows more polarized. However, if groups are successful at moderating the beliefs of increasingly stubborn legislators, then we might expect that groups opposed to the majority party will spend more as polarization increases. Alternatively, if interest groups advance their agendas primarily by enhancing the efforts of their legislative allies, then they should lobby harder when their friends are both more productive and more supportive. Thus, party polarization should encourage more lobbying by groups allied with the majority party. Party cohesion and majority party seat share are expected to have the same effect as party polarization. Preliminary results suggest that as the parties grow more polarized, interest groups spend less on lobbying.  <br/> <br/>Technical Summary<br/> <br/>Scholars have long believed that the power of interest groups is inversely related to the discipline and cohesion of the governing political parties. But interest groups may remain influential even in the face of strong parties, because they provide and process technical information and have grown more experienced at lobbying. This project examines how party conditions associated with party strength affect lobbying expenditures by organized interests. A negative relationship between each of these conditions and lobbying expenditures would be consistent with the exogenous cost model of lobbying. Alternatively, increases in each party condition might encourage interest groups allied with the majority party to increasingly subsidize the efforts of friendly legislators. The endogenous cost model of lobbying predicts that, as each party condition increases, interest groups opposed to the majority party will spend more on lobbying. Quantitative analyses is performed using an original dataset of lobbying expenditures in thirty-two state legislatures from 2001 to 2014 and interviews of lobbyists. The investigator expects that an increase in party polarization will substantially reduce interest group lobbying expenditures. The project will not only provide an indirect test of contemporary lobbying theories, but it will help to build empirical generalizations about the roles and relationship between political parties and interest groups in democratic politics."

That is, malnutrition and obesity might co-exist within a particular society. This dissertation research will collect body measurements and biomarker data to investigate whether outcomes on the extremes of nutritional spectrum co-exist together and at what units of analysis.  Specifically, the investigator will study nutritional and health outcomes and their causes at finer spatial scales and link these individual outcomes to household and background factors that contribute to health.  The project takes advantage of existing longitudinal data from the mid-1990s, and ongoing fieldwork that tracks demographic and social changes. This project will also looks at early-life and other influences on health. Thus, prospective and retrospective data will be analyzed to determine early-life factors that might affect current nutritional outcomes. The literature on the nutrition transition has focused on trends at the country or region-level. The dual burden of undernutrition and over nutrition is one feature of this nutritional transition. <br/><br/>Lower and Middle Income (LMICs) countries are now also experiencing spatial and urban transformations, changes in food production, globalization and increasing social inequalities that are pinpointed as factors responsible for shifts in nutritional outcomes and towards increased diet-related Non-communicable Diseases (NCDs). The social, and not necessarily economic, roots of this shift has allowed ""epidemics"" of over nutrition and related chronic NCDs to extend beyond high-income countries to those usually classified as developing countries. The public-health- interpretation often presents a linear theory of this societal transformation. This project takes a sociologically informed view, which recognizes that the social processes driving these shifts are unevenly distributed. It focuses more on the micro processes within the community and household that might result in heterogeneous consequences like extreme nutritional outcomes, now referred to as the dual burden. This dual burden phenomenon allows a possibility where undernutrition and over nutrition might represent different facets of deprivation. The high and continued prevalence of undernutrition at early ages does not negate the possibility of later-life problems of over nutrition. The related burden of NCDs for South Asia, the region being studied, has risen at a rate exceeding global rates. The dual nutritional status burden examined in this project has a potential impact on national healthcare policy, international aid objectives and more. Thus, the detection and determinants of such a dual burden is a concern for both individuals and communities.  The study builds on collaboration with an existing research site in Nepal, the Chitwan Valley Family Study (CVFS)."

However, absorption of light in excess of that which can be used for photosynthesis can lead to light-induced damage. Thus, photoprotective mechanisms have evolved in photosynthetic organisms to deal with excess light absorption or stressful conditions, including fluctuating light. Photoprotective mechanisms used by cyanobacteria have only recently begun to be characterized. A key factor involved in cyanobacterial photoprotection is the Orange Carotenoid Protein (OCP) that works together with the Fluorescence Recovery Protein (FRP) to convert excess light energy to heat to protect the photosynthetic reaction centers from photodamage, thereby maintaining photosynthetic efficiency and productivity. The proposed work will contribute to a greater understanding of the range of variants of these proteins that are present in ecologically distinct cyanobacteria. In addition to training students and postdoctoral scientists in diverse methods, broader impacts of the research include understanding the mechanisms used by cyanobacteria to protect themselves from excess light absorption and associated light-induced damage. Such knowledge will enhance efforts to increase the efficiency of light capture and reduce photodamage in bioenergy or production strains of cyanobacteria. The project also includes structured mentoring in hands-on research for undergraduates from groups underrepresented in the sciences and participation in an annual Microbiology Day at a local science museum targeting primary and middle school students. <br/><br/>In contrast to those of plants, the photoprotective mechanisms of cyanobacteria have only recently begun to be characterized. One of the most prevalent, the OCP/FRP (Orange Carotenoid Protein/Fluorescence Recovery Protein) system responds to high light by dissipating excess energy captured by the light harvesting antenna (phycobilisome or PBS).  The OCP is a soluble, 35 kDa protein that binds a single carotenoid molecule.   It is the only known photoactive protein that uses a carotenoid as its sole chromophore. The absorption of blue-green light causes the OCP to convert from a dark stable orange form, OCPO, to a light-activated red form, OCPR.  OCPR directly participates in photoprotection by binding to the PBS.  Recovery from the energy-dissipative state is catalyzed by the FRP.  Structurally, the OCP consists of two domains, one serving as a sensor/regulatory domain whereas the other functions directly in energy dissipation.  We have identified a family of paralogous genes encoding the separate domains in Fremyella diplosiphon and hypothesize that they reflect the evolution of the OCP and that they provide flexibility in tuning photoprotection in Fremyella under dynamic environmental conditions.  A combination of in vivo approaches in Fremyella and in vitro analysis of the isolated proteins will be used in conjunction with bioinformatics to test these hypotheses.   In addition to training students and postdoctoral scientists in diverse methods, broader impacts of the research include an in-depth understanding of the flexibility of photoprotective mechanisms that may be useful in bioengineering of cyanobacteria."

In particular, it will test the hypothesis that different species that evolve similar characteristics do so by changes in the same genes.  This hypothesis will be examined using species in the plant genus Penstemon that have independently evolved a similar suite of floral characters (e.g. long, narrow flowers, increased nectar production, lengthening of the reproductive organs) in response to pollination by hummingbirds.  If this hypothesis is true, then in different hummingbird-pollinated species, genes affecting a given character should be located at similar positions in the genome.  The project will test this expectation using genetic and genomic approaches applied to four hummingbird-pollinated species and closely related species pollinated by bees.  In addition, this research will determine the developmental basis (e.g. changes in cell size or cell proliferation) for the character changes.  In examining the main hypothesis, the project will sequence the genomes of three Penstemon species and provide genetic maps.  These resources will be made available to the scientific community.  The project will provide training for one postdoc and several graduate students in molecular and genomic techniques, as well as in bioinformatics and statistical analysis.  Finally, it will introduce undergraduate students to the sciences of evolutionary biology and genomics through internships and independent study with the PI and co-PI of the project, with a focus on minority student participation.<br/><br/>This project examines parallelism across different hierarchical levels (developmental vs. genetic), across different trait types within the pollination syndrome (quantitative vs. qualitative traits), and across different origins of flowers adapted to hummingbird pollination.  In doing so, it will provide the first extensive data specifically designed to determine the extent to which parallel phenotypic evolution of a complex multi-trait syndrome, comprised of multiple quantitative characters, evolved by parallel genetic and developmental mechanisms.  Penstemon species pairs representing four independent transitions from bee to hummingbird pollination floral syndromes will provide the foundation of this research.  For each of the four species pairs, the developmental differences that lead to divergent bee and hummingbird-adapted floral morphologies will be assessed to determine whether differences reflect parallel developmental processes.  For the same four species pairs, genetic mapping combined with genome sequencing will be used to assess whether quantitative floral trait loci identified in independent transitions to hummingbird pollination correspond to homologous genomic regions containing the same set of homologous candidate genes, suggestive that parallelism extends to the genetic level.  As few studies have examined genetic parallelism in quantitative traits, the project includes the development of a novel 'genetic parallelism score' to quantify the degree of genetic parallelism for both quantitative and qualitative traits.  Lastly, by quantifying developmental parameters in genetic lines derived from the mapping study, the project will link genetic and developmental processes by determining how fixed genetic differences between bee- and hummingbird-adapted species alter the specific developmental processes that contribute to divergent floral traits."

While high spending can be justified given the potential value of health services, recent research indicates that spending could be reduced without negatively affecting health. The Affordable Care Act of 2010 greatly increased access to health care but included few provisions to meet the cost growth challenge head on. Current policy approaches to facilitate efficient health care spending include (i) consumer cost-sharing  (ii) health technology assessment (iii) physician payment reform and (iv) improved use of IT.			<br/>This project seeks to advance our understanding of how to improve population health in a cost-effective manner. It focuses on better understanding (i) how physicians respond to financial incentives for providing quality health care and (ii) how physician treatments respond to the availability of sophisticated IT tools. Despite the importance of understanding these medical provider behaviors, there is limited research on these topics. The project leverages unique data and employs cutting edge methods in economics to advance our scientific understanding of physician and patient behaviors in these domains. These research advances should have direct implications for policies that seek to improve national health and well-being in a cost-effective manner.  <br/>In addition to this research dimension, the project will set up a workshop for graduate students in health economics designed to promote a comprehensive understanding of the scientific techniques necessary to make advances in this field in original research. This workshop will bring together leading health economists from across the country to train Ph.D. students in both health economics and health policy. Both the proposed and proposed workshop will have broader impacts beyond just the scientific advances, including policy impacts in the space of health care and professional impacts in training a new generation of health economists. <br/><br/><br/>On the research side, this project investigates several new large-scale datasets that track both physician behaviors and patient behaviors in detail. The first environment to be studied is the Hawaii Medical Service Association (HMSA), the largest insurer in the state of Hawaii. HMSA has implemented a range of state-of-the-art quality incentive programs to encourage physicians to provide higher quality medical care. In addition, in 2012 HMSA led the system-wide implementation of a sophisticated IT tool that provides physicians with specific real-time information on their quality performance. In the context of these natural experiments, there are detailed administrative data on (i) patient behaviors and characteristics for over 700,000 patients and (ii) physician behaviors and characteristics for over 1,000 physicians. Key micro-level information are observed on exactly how physicians respond to quality incentives and use available IT, both before and after HMSA implemented specific key changes. The PI will leverage these micro-level data to investigate heterogeneous effects related to physician training, the profile of patients a physician treats, and characteristics of physician organizations. The analysis will be used to investigate ways to structurally improve physician quality incentives and use of IT with the goals of higher quality and more cost-effective health care. <br/>The second environment that will be investigated is Maine Medical Center, which worked with a technology partner AgileMD to implement mobile technology that aids its 200+ physicians in the treatment of complex medical conditions. In this context, the PI will use a randomized evaluation, together with detailed data on physician behaviors and use of IT, to study the role of mobile technology on productivity.  <br/>This research program uses cutting edge methods in economics together with novel datasets to investigate key intellectual questions that will enhance our understanding of the economics of an important policy area. In addition to this intellectual merit, the project will have broader impact through both the policies it will impact and the workshop to train a new generation of health economists."

They cover the broad frequency range from radio frequency (RF) to microwave to terahertz (THz). Typical applications include wireless fidelity (Wi-Fi) systems, microwave ovens, bluetooth systems, wireless power transfer, satellite communication, anti-collision car radar, airport security check systems, THz imaging, and many others. With the advent of these systems, high-frequency electronic components are now required to support electronic systems operating in many different frequency bands and with different characteristics. To address this issue, it is important to design and realize high-frequency electronic components with reconfigurable and highly flexible responses (e.g. THz components with tunable frequency band and large modulation depth). Up to now, almost all of such high-frequency components are made of solid materials.  Their physical structures are rigid, fixed and difficult to reconfigure. This research will study novel liquid-based high-frequency electronic components. The employment of liquids to replace conventional solid materials will facilitate the generation of reconfigurable and intelligent electronic systems with high adaptability. The intelligence is enabled by electronically manipulating liquid movements and morphing its shape. The proposed research will pave the way for the development of liquid-based electronic systems.  In addition to advancing knowledge in both science and engineering, the proposed project will have potential broad impacts to our society, including improvements to communication, safety, health care, and defense systems. This project will also produce exciting learning and training opportunities for students.<br/><br/>The explosive development of communication systems in the past decade has imposed stringent design challenges for high-frequency components. For example, the emerging THz technology has called for the innovative design of THz components with advanced functionalities. The proposed project aims to realize efficient use and control of liquid materials to adaptively change the responses of high-frequency devices, from which system level intelligence can be achieved to actively control these devices for optimal performance. Electrowetting on dielectric (EWOD) will be employed as the tuning mechanism to realize agile actuation and programmable transport of liquids. The resulting novel liquid-based high-frequency devices can operate efficiently at the broad spectrum from RF/microwave to THz. By leveraging multi-disciplinary knowledge in electromagnetics and electrowetting techniques, this project has the following three innovations: (1) design of novel liquid-based THz components with transformative characteristics and properties; (2) use of the EWOD technique to realize adaptive tuning of the high-frequency devices with reconfigurable and programmable responses; (3) tuning of high-frequency components through three-dimensional manipulation of liquids. The proposed research represents a systematic and interdisciplinary effort to realize liquid-based high-frequency components with a fully electronically-controlled tuning and flexible properties, covering a broad range of applications such as communications, security, and sensing.

Dinucleotides act as second messengers in bacteria to regulate bacterial biofilm and virulence factors production but many receptors that are involved in dinucleotide signaling are yet to be identified or fully characterized. This proposal aims to develop probes for the identification and characterization of new nucleotide receptors in bacteria. Efforts will also be directed towards the development of synthetic molecules that strongly associate with second messenger nucleotides to disrupt the biological activities of the signaling nucleotides. These molecules could be used to modulate the transition between the biofilm and planktonic states.<br/><br/>Microbial biofilms are sometimes responsible for the clogging of pipes at homes or industrial settings. Additionally, biofilms that form in humans or livestock contribute to the persistence of microbial infections. Currently there are only a handful of non-toxic compounds that can effectively disperse microbial biofilms. Therefore studies that shed more insights into biofilm formation by microbes could lead to the identification of new strategies to eradicate biofilms. The broader Impacts of this project include increasing our understanding of how bacteria form biofilms, which could be useful for the development of strategies to curb bacterial biofilm formation.  With regards to STEM education, high school students and teachers, undergraduate and graduate student researchers who work on this project will develop diverse skill sets, including chemistry, molecular biology and microbiology. This multi-disciplinary experience will prepare such students for diverse careers.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Systems and Synthetic Biology Cluster in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences (MCB) Division of the Biological Sciences (BIO) Directorate."

It supports theoretical research and education concerning the electronic and structural properties of organic molecular crystals.  In this project, high-throughput computational methods will be utilized to establish a database for such crystals comprised of experimental and computational results.  The ultimate aim of the database is to establish chemical trends within various groups, and to uncover useful conducting and semi-conducting organic molecular crystals that are lighter, more flexible, and cheaper than their inorganic counterparts.<br/><br/>Consistent, accurate prediction of molecular crystalline properties has been a coveted goal of the computational physics and chemistry communities for decades. With recent developments of several dispersion correction schemes within the density functional theory framework, reliable calculations of weakly interacting systems are quickly becoming a reality. Presently, prediction of morphology, band structure, band gap, surface absorption and reactivity, thermodynamic quantities, and solubility properties of molecular crystals remains cutting edge, but is rapidly becoming common place. With the advancements in methodology and hardware comes the next evolutionary step, the development of a high-throughput density-functional-theory derived molecular crystal properties database for the discovery of useful new materials and chemical trends. The PI and his group plan to bring about a paradigm shift in soft-solid materials research and development by establishing a freely accessible web-based organic molecular crystal properties database.  The particular objectives will be to: <br/><br/>1) Establish data selection protocols for organic molecular crystal groups of interest, <br/>2) Implement a practical data generation method: This involves the determination of chemical accuracy within a given density functional theory method,<br/>3) Develop an interface for data storage and retrieval, <br/>4) Identify properties trends within crystal groups and establish new organic conducting and small band gap semi-conducting materials through data analysis. <br/><br/><br/>The development of an organic molecular crystal properties database will have a short-term goal of enabling rapid identification of chemical trends and prediction of new materials with useful transport properties, with an extended goal of freely providing the organized physical- and meta-data to other researchers in pharmaceutical, supramolecular, crystallographic, and electronics fields; in line with the Research Data Alliance initiatives.  <br/><br/>Organic molecular crystals have shown great promise as active materials in organic-based electronic devices such as transistors, light emitting diodes, and solar cells. The fundamental understanding established in this research project will help enable the rapid fabrication and engineering of new electronic devices such as lightweight and cheap flexible displays, electronic labels and solid-state lighting.

Our group, the Good Judgment Project, competed and won the tournament each year from 2011 to 2015. In a 2015 study based on data from this project, Mellers, Arkes, and Chen examined changes in actively open-minded thinking (i.e., the tendency to look for evidence that contradicts one's favored views) between the time participants entered and exited the tournament. Forecasters were significantly more open-minded at the end of the tournament. Even opinionated forecasters appeared to become more circumspect when making judgments that were publicly scored for accuracy. These incentives may have encouraged self-critical and flexible patterns of thinking because the quest for accuracy may have trumped the desire to maintain partisan positions. The boost in open-mindedness (perhaps driven by the self-discipline needed to be accurate) may well be the most important discovery of the IARPA tournaments. This project moves this research forward with designs for new tournaments to pry open closed minds still further. The research team examines three behavioral interventions that might increase open-mindedness and reduce polarization that characterizes many political debates. The discovery of methods to change opinions and cognitive styles may reduce divisiveness and ultimately improve decision making in a world that seems more fractured and divided than ever.<br/><br/>This project explores whether forecasting tournaments can be designed to increase open-mindedness. The research team uses an existing public tournament to explore three factors. The first is accountability to a heterogeneous forecasting team with variability in political orientations. The previous IARPA tournaments showed that team forecasts were more accurate than independent forecasts. The researchers, however, never explored team composition, and this factor may be critical. The second factor is group pre-commitment to cognitive flexibility. Before the outcomes of events are known, forecasters will state whether they would be willing to change their minds about various debates depending on the outcomes. In ""before"" surveys, participants will be asked: If outcome A occurs (or does not occur), how much should your political party (or the other party) change its mind about issue X, ""After"" surveys will measure changes in cognitive styles and political views. The third factor is perspective taking. When forecasting questions are released, the researchers will ask liberals to write a paragraph to express the conservative position, and vice versa. Participants will be told that their work will be evaluated based on how well it captures the essence of the other side's position. The research team will use Pre and post measures of open-mindedness and political viewpoints to evaluate the effectiveness and changes that occur from the interventions."

One major reason for this shift toward larger social networks as solvers of scientific problems is that problems are becoming increasingly complex and require different areas of expertise, making them too difficult for individuals to solve alone. Although there is great potential for the use of networks of individuals and teams in the pursuit of science, they require individuals to navigate through the interpersonal complexities of those networks. Such complexities are especially evident when one considers that individuals, in order to accomplish their work, may be connected or tied not only to others working in the same organization, but also to others working in different organizations. With this in mind, the purpose of this research is to understand how the quantity, quality, and composition of individuals' internal and external ties influence performance in a scientific context, with a particular emphasis on the ways in which external ties facilitate or hinder the effects of internal ties on performance. Understanding the joint influence of internal and external social network ties not only has the potential to promote the progress of science, but it also has implications for contexts outside of science collaboration. For example, the knowledge generated by this research will have implications for medical care, which is increasingly provided by networks of individuals and teams, business organizations, which are utilizing teams that transcend the boundaries of a single organization, and the military, with its use of Joint Forces and Combined Operations.  <br/><br/>Via survey methodology, this research will generate data from a sample of scientists on their internal ties and external ties to other scientists working in particle physics facilities throughout the U.S. system of federally funded laboratories. To avoid limitations associated with self-report, the investigators will attempt to corroborate external ties reported by focal individuals with reports from internal ties. By identifying the quantity and quality of external, boundary spanning ties within the larger scientific ecosystem, the investigators will be able to examine issues such as the predictive validity of external ties relative to internal ties, whether external ties moderate the effects of internal ties on measures of performance, and whether the composition of external ties results in differential effects on performance, even when taking internal ties into account. In all, the initial identification of external ties, in conjunction with data on internal ties, represents an important extension because external ties may operate in a different manner relative to internal ties given that they may be characterized by (a) greater geographic dispersion, (b) higher levels of goal misalignment between teams, (c) less diversity because of the voluntary nature of external ties, and (d) less face-to-face interaction, depending upon the level of communication technology."

Archival research will provide a backdrop to current events that will be investigated ethnographically.  The project addresses a significant gap in comparative studies of infrastructure, refocusing attention on the implications of the always-changing technologies, sociotechnical-organization, and institutional environments that make up contemporary research infrastructures.  The central research questions is: How are ""old organizations"" renewing themselves to sustain value for ""new science""? By investigating the past and present of cyberinfrastructures that have weathered many transformations, this research seeks to inform future cyberinfrastructure development efforts.  The findings will identify successful ""strategies of the long-term"" -- organizational forms and methods of design with a track-record of facilitating responsiveness to change.  These insights will be a contribution to the fields of Science and Technology Studies (STS), science policy, organization science, and the sociotechnical design of research infrastructure.<br/><br/>The purpose of this research is to understand the challenges that long-term scientific organizations face over time, and the strategies they employ to manage these challenges. The development of scientific research infrastructure is central to the NSF?s vision of science; however there has as yet been little or sporadic empirical attention to the dynamics of flexible long-term infrastructure in the face of changing social organization, information technology (IT) and scientific interests. This research will fill that gap, contributing to new, practical, and boundary-spanning knowledge about the characteristics of infrastructure in the making and over the long-term.  This project will inform efforts to build more open, effective, and sustainable cyberinfrastructure in the sciences, leading to smarter and more sustainable investment and design choices on the part of cyberinfrastructure project leaders, participants, tool builders, and funders.

Einstein's Equations connect the curvature of spacetime to its mass/energy content. In local coordinates they can be written as the system of coupled nonlinear partial differential equations. Due to their complexity, most studies have focused on exact solutions, obtained by imposing additional symmetries, which include Schwarzschild (non-rotating black holes) and Kerr (rotating black holes) spacetimes. A natural and highly nontrivial problem is whether these particular solutions are stable under small perturbations. In other words, assuming that at a moment in time the curvature of a given spacetime is very close to the curvature of a Kerr spacetime, it is expected that after evolving for a long time it will eventually approach a (potentially different) Kerr spacetime. The main goal of this project is understanding the behavior of solutions to equations and systems of equations that model Einstein's Equations, but are simpler. The study of these toy problems is necessary in order to tackle the much harder nonlinear stability problem mentioned above. <br/><br/>There has recently been a flurry of activity with regard to understanding the decay for the linear wave equations on Schwarzschild and Kerr spacetimes, which is the simplest possible model to study. Even this problem is quite difficult, since the complicated background geometry affects the dispersion properties in nontrivial ways. In compact regions one must deal with high frequency wave packets that linger along trapped geodesics for a long time, while at infinity the non-Euclidean character of the metric affects the pointwise rates of decay. The very delicate (and unstable) nature of the trapped set in particular requires tools coming from harmonic analysis, differential equations, and differential geometry. Nevertheless, robust ways of measuring decay (e.g. local energy estimates and Strichartz estimates) have now been established. These estimates can in turn be used to tackle nonlinear problems like global well-posedness (existence and uniqueness of solutions, and continuous dependence of initial data). One example of such nonlinear problems is the semilinear wave equation with power nonlinearities for both small and large initial data. Another example, which is a good model of Einstein's Equations in harmonic coordinates, is the wave equation for a metric that itself depends on the solution. These techniques can also be used to settle the problem of optimal decay of solutions to the Maxwell Equations, the linear system which describes the evolution of an electromagnetic field on Schwarzschild and Kerr backgrounds. Finally, there is interest in the study of higher dimensional black holes coming from string theory, which at low energies can be described by higher-dimensional theories of gravity. Understanding the relevant decay properties for the wave equation on these backgrounds would also be quite interesting."

While many studies focus on the jamming and flow of particle-fluid mixtures, there has been little work on the effects of surface chemistry, such as the relative hydrophobic or hydrophilic properties of the grains. In addition to the relevance of surface chemistry in soil mechanics and industrial problems, such as effects on erosion, water runoff, and filtration, hydrophobicity also provides a control parameter on the effective cohesion of grains.  Recent applications of the jamming phase picture to colloidal systems with attractive interactions are related examples of the importance of grain-grain interactions mediated by surface properties.  <br/>This Research at Undergraduate Institutions (RUI) proposal aims to systematically study the effect of the hydrophobic interactions in both the well-characterized rotating drum geometry and jamming behavior in flow through a constriction.  Rheology and dynamics are studied in systems (i) that vary by fraction of hydrophobic grains and (ii) that are submerged in solvents of different polarities to tune the importance of the surface chemistry effects. This set of experiments has direct relevance to surface chemistry of soil particulates that impact soil/water interactions. In addition, these samples can be submerged in fluids of different polarity to control the relative importance of the surface chemistry effects.  The preliminary data show both a strong tendency of hydrophobic grains to segregate from water and a decreased response when submerged in a relatively non-polar liquid like isopropanol or hexane.  Known particle/solvent systems relevant to work on colloidal stability will be used and then extended to miscible fluids of different polarities which will allow fine-tuned control of the effective cohesion between hydrophobic grains. We will quantitatively measure the effective hydrophobicity and correlate these with flow properties such as angle of repose, jamming probability, segregation effects, and rheological shear strength.<br/><br/>A final objective related to the broader impacts of this proposal is the scientific training of undergraduate research students in a highly interdisciplinary research environment. This project will directly involve the training of up to six undergraduate researchers over the duration of the program, but it is expected that up to ten will likely be impacted including unpaid research for credit during the academic year. In addition, we plan to hire a high school teacher for the summer of year 2, in order to continue one of JMU's missions of educating teachers.  The students will be exposed to issues in materials science and complex systems, including rheology, dynamics, and image processing. The participants in this program will be expected to participate in activities related to the NSF Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) sites in chemistry and materials science at JMU to become part of a ""community of scholars"" with over sixty other summer undergraduate researchers in chemistry and materials science at JMU. In summary, this program helps serve to broadly impact the pipeline of future scientists from the high school through the graduate level with students trained in cutting-edge research in multiphase flows."

Proteins and RNA are among the most important molecules of life. They carry out all the functions in cells by adopting specific shapes and through mutual interactions.  In a third project, Dr. Thirumalai uses modern theoretical and computational tools to decipher how molecular motors transport cargo by walking on polar tracks. Such transport is required for cells to function properly.  Thus, fundamental principles of chemistry and physics are used to describe the molecular basis of the translation of cellular information, resulting in increased understanding of essential biological processes.  The Biophysics program in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biology and the Physics of Living Systems program in the Physics Division contribute equally to this award.  In addition to students and postdoctoral associates, undergraduates from several universities contribute to these projects.  <br/><br/><br/>In order to attain the broad goals outlined above, Dr. Thirumalai addresses key questions in three areas. (1) Protein Folding: In order to function, proteins must fold to a compact three-dimensional shape, which is specified by the primary sequence of amino acids. It is suspected that the initial step in this process is the collapse of the chain from an extended state although the conclusions based on different experiments vary. In order to resolve this important controversy, Dr. Thirumalai will use fully atomistically-detailed simulations of both model systems and proteins to dissect the nature of the collapse process. (2) RNA folding: In contrast to protein folding, little is known about RNA folding. These highly charged molecules, built from four nucleotides, require cations to fold. Thirumalai develops new models to describe how these cations interact with RNA to facilitate their folding.  This project combines analytical theory with novel computational methods. (3) Molecular Motors: kinesin, dynein, and myosin are motors that transport cargo across microtubules and actin, which are polar tracks. Many beautiful single molecule experiments have shown that they walk hand-over-hand across these tracks. The molecular basis of this motion is not fully understood. Dr. Thirumalai develops new models to simulate their movements in order to illustrate the coupling between the internal dynamics and the motility. In addition, he and his coworkers explore the design of the lever arm to explore the robustness of their motions on the polar tracks."

There are a number of civilian applications where deploying a human-robot team consisting of several small USVs and one or more human supervisors can significantly reduce costs, improve safety, and increase operational efficiencies. Representative applications include remote/persistent ocean sensing, marine search and rescue, maritime operations in congested port environments, and industrial offshore supply and support. USVs face unique challenges that are not experienced by robots operating indoors, such as: the need to adhere to marine navigation rules (COLREGs); local current, wave and wind conditions that can severely reduce the dynamic range of sensors and actuators; frequent communication interruptions; and risk and urgency due to rapidly changing situations during outdoor on-water operations. This research aims to develop decision making foundations for enabling teams of humans and USVs to perform complex collaborative tasks. Advances in this area could be extremely important from both a regulatory and practical standpoint for the future deployment of USV systems. Results from this research will enable leveraging the tremendous potential of USVs by reducing the cost of deployment and operational risks in civilian applications. The integration of the research with graduate and undergraduate courses will enhance the robotics and ocean engineering curricula and enrich learning experiences of the participating students. Outreach activities will educate and inform K-12 students about career opportunities in marine robotics. <br/> <br/>The overall goal of the proposed effort is to make advances in risk-informed decision making so that teams of USVs and human supervisors can work cooperatively on a wide variety of missions.

Progress in these constituent components will be pursued to ensure that they are consistent with each other and to explicitly account for risk during decision making. This research will develop methodologies to model team missions to ensure that all phases of decision making will have the required information for making informed decisions. Decision making methodologies will be developed for sparse advisory control of USV teams to mitigate risks and for coordinating and assigning tasks to different USVs in the team. Algorithms will also be developed for risk-aware deliberative trajectory planning and generating and executing reactive behaviors for mitigating risks. The methods developed will be validated through on-water field experiments."

The discovery of the structure of DNA, the molecule that carries genetic information, provided only a framework for describing how the genetic code is copied. However, focusing on DNA in isolation does not provide insights into how the entire machinery, needed to sustain the viability of the cell, is conveyed from the mother to the daughter cell. This is accomplished by networks of other protein molecules that transmit information through chemical reactions both in the process of replication, cell division, and adaptation. How do theses individual molecular components interact and function in a system that is capable of replicating, adapting to changing environment, and operating robustly in noisy crowded milieu?  What is the minimum level of complexity needed for a living cell to function? What sets the length scale of such a living system in terms of the molecular constituents? The goal is to develop a quantitative conceptual framework to answer these questions so that the ability to process signals, adapt, and replicate with high fidelity can be described using the laws of physics and chemistry  and using a bacterium as a case study. The interdisciplinary approach to this research involves integrating physics, chemistry, and information theory concepts, and is expected to provide a versatile training ground for students and postdoctoral fellows with diverse backgrounds.<br/><br/>In order to achieve the major objectives of the proposed research it is necessary to break new ground by creating new models and ideas coming from a variety of fields. An integrated approach will be developed by combining coarse-grained models of enzymatic reactions, ways of coupling feedback effects due to synthesis of small molecules and proteins, and accounting for non-equilibrium processes. These ideas will be used to explore the organization principles for adaptation to environmental fluctuations, cell size control, and competition between various factors that promote homeostasis.   These new concepts will be used to provide a new framework on how a simple bacterium is versatile enough to respond to harsh environmental fluctuations (high salinity or osmolarity) and adapt in a noisy environment.  Analyzing such behavior will require combining control theory and the underlying stochastic aspects of signal transmission achieved through chemical reaction networks.  In addition, the key question of how cell shape and size (on the order of a micron) emerge will be explored based on the notion that they use feedback to maintain proteostasis and keep the concentrations of metabolites in check. The questions raised here are fundamental and even if answered partially could have far-reaching implications in our understanding of how living systems function.

Multifunctional coatings are material systems intentionally encoded with multiple engineering functionalities. The main research objective is to derive and validate the fundamental electromechanical behavior of multifunctional layer-by-layer CNT-polyelectrolyte (PE) thin films. Their coupled electrical and mechanical properties will be tested using experiments, characterized by theory, and simulated numerically across different length scales. First, CNT-PE thin films will be subjected to mechanical, fracture, and viscoelastic tests. A micro-electro-mechanical model will then be derived and validated for simulating thin film electromechanical response to different types of applied loads. Next, the model will be used to evaluate the effects of defects on bulk film linear/non-linear properties, as well as the effects of inhomogeneity of large coatings. Finally, a finite element model that incorporates spatial variations of electromechanical properties will be created for assessing and comparing to experiments their spatial sensing and mechanical behavior. This research will explain, from a physics standpoint, why these nanocomposites possess such unique linear/non-linear and static/time-dependent electromechanical behavior. <br/><br/>The research impacts will be the derivation of new theory, numerical models, and experimental data that describe, in a holistic sense and across different length scales, the electromechanical behavior of these CNT-based multifunctional thin films. The experimental methods, analysis techniques, and models developed are applicable to a broad array of nanocomposites and coatings. New knowledge and innovations in areas such as multi-physics modeling, mechanics, materials science, nano-engineering, sensor systems, and multifunctional coatings will be generated. The lessons learned will facilitate the implementation of future coatings in real-world applications. Integral to this CAREER project is also an education/outreach plan to equip future students/workforce with the knowledge, skills, and business training for them to pursue and secure careers in nanotechnology-enabled multifunctional materials. A nanoscience for sensing course series will be developed. Students from underrepresented and economically disadvantaged groups and female students will be recruited for this new effort and for research.

DNA sequencing costs and throughput have improved by orders of magnitudes over the last three decades, although many questions remain unsolved, especially because of the short sequence lengths currently available. Emerging ""third generation"" sequencing technology from Pacific Biosciences, Moleculo, Oxford Nanopore, and other companies are poised to revolutionize genomics by enabling the sequencing of long, individual molecules of DNA and RNA. The sequence lengths with these technologies can reach up to tens of thousands of nucleotides, however few or no analysis packages are capable of dealing with these types of genetic sequence data. This project will overcome these limitations by developing several novel analysis algorithms specifically for long read single molecule sequencing and their associated complex error models. The outcomes will help answer biological questions of profound significance to all of society, such as: What were the genetic implications of the domestication of rice? What genes and regulatory elements give rise to the incredible regenerative properties of the flatworm? or, What can be understood from assembling reference genomes of sugarcane and pineapple towards breeding more robust plant crops and biofuels?<br/><br/>Specific objectives of the research include working towards assembling entire plant and animal chromosomes into complete, haplotype-phased sequences; identifying fusion genes and complex alternative splicing patterns responsible for diseases or adaptability; and searching for structural variations associated with improved crop yield or human diseases such as cancer or autism. Even if some future technology is capable of directly reading entire transcripts or entire genomes, this research will remain necessary to examine the higher level relationships across populations of genomes or in measuring the dynamics of gene expression and splicing.<br/><br/>This project will tightly integrate research and education, promoting opportunities at high school through postdoctoral levels with the development of new course materials, hands-on research opportunities, and one-on-one mentoring experiences. This effort will specifically target the intersection of computer science and biology, promoting interdisciplinary education, and ensuring the next generation of scientists are ready for the complexities of quantitative and digital biology. To engage the widest possible audience, Dr Schatz  will also develop novel online teaching materials made available through a yearly bioinformatics contest. The first round of the contest reached nearly 1000 students around the world and at all levels of education, engaging students far beyond our physical limits. The products of the research will be made available as open-source software, and installed into the graphical iPlant Discovery Environment making them easily accessible to the large community of plant researcher around the world."

The chemistry that occurs on these surfaces can alter gas phase concentrations of key atmospheric constituents as well as significantly change the physicochemical properties of the particles. In the environment, these interfaces are present as both aerosol and stationary surfaces. In the proposed studies, reactions of atmospheric gases with components of mineral dust and metal-containing particles are investigated to better understand the chemistry of the troposphere and the impact that these reactions have on the environment. Several different aspects will be investigated and include the heterogeneous chemistry of organic acids with mineral dust particles, the heterogeneous chemistry of atmospheric gases on photoactive components of mineral dust aerosol and surface reactions of anthropogenic metal-containing oxide particles, which are components of atmospheric aerosol as well as stationary surfaces. These reactions take place under different regimes of water activity and, therefore, different phases of water including adsorbed water at the gas-solid interface and liquid water at the liquid-solid interface.<br/><br/>The proposed activities focus on better understanding the fundamental chemistry that occurs at aerosol and stationary particle surfaces. Without these types of fundamental studies, there would be little information to incorporate into atmospheric and environmental model simulations and there would be little understanding of this potentially important reaction chemistry that may impact the environment.  Besides broader impacts related to better understanding the natural and human-impacted environment, another important component of this research is in the educational and outreach activities that are proposed. These include training of undergraduate and graduate students. The PI has a research program that attracts a diverse group of students including many women and underrepresented minorities.

Positioning of the cell division plane in cytokinesis is a fundamental and universal cellular process that has broad relevance to cell morphogenesis, development, tissue architecture, and stem cells. The aims of this research are to determine the molecular mechanisms governing this process.  This project utilizes the sea urchin embryo as a potent animal cell model for symmetric cell division.  Cell division site determination involves multiple processes. The cell initially positions and orients the nucleus in late interphase along a reproducible axis relative to its cell shape.  In this process, the nucleus must somehow sense the shape of the cell.  The axis of the interphase nucleus sets the position of the spindle in mitosis, which then specifies the site of cleavage in cytokinesis.  The project will focus on the mechanisms of how the nucleus is positioned, how cell shape is sensed, and how the spindle signals to the cortex to specify the division plane.  The researchers have recently developed a powerful new approach to study the effect of cell geometry in a systematic manner by manipulating the shape of sea urchin cells by introducing them into micro-fabricated chambers of different shapes (such as rectangles, triangles, etc.    The project will include live cell experiments focusing on the identifying the location of and specific molecular motor responsible for nuclear positioning coupled with computational modeling of how the division plane is determined in cells manipulated into different shapes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:  The researchers continue longstanding efforts to increase the diversity of scientists by broadening participation of underrepresented minorities in science.

These students are mentored to participate in a number of activities whose aim is to better equip them, should they choose to pursue a scientific career. At the national level, the PI is continuing in a leadership role in programs whose goal is to increase the diversity of scientists including leading NSF supported efforts for SACNAS, for the American Society for Cell Biology and serving in a regular capacity to effect policy change, evaluate programs, and contribute to national activities by service to the AAAS, the NSF, and to colleges, universities and scientific societies."

Evidence-based identification of learning communities will then provide the basis for strategically matching them with a subset of the many resources and experiences already developed for ethical STEM education. This study will be conducted simultaneously at campuses with different constituencies and cultures: (1) Saint Mary's College, an all-women's college; (2) the University of Notre Dame, a Catholic research university; (3) Xavier University, a Historically Black College or University (HBCU); and (4) the University of Virginia, a public research university. <br/><br/>The methods employed will include administration and analysis of five validated scales (for learning style, personality, moral concern, moral action, and environmental orientation) and automated text analysis of student writings in three different formats (electronic journal entry, online discussion forum, and Twitter).

Part A will document the biodiversity of 6 groups of marine organisms with high, but poorly known, diversity in the Southern Caribbean (sponges, hydroids, sea anemones, sea squirts, ribbon worms, and seaweeds). This work will emphasize the integration of traditional morphological and molecular characters with non-traditional characters such as larval morphology, live coloration, and characters derived from confocal and electron microscopy. Established experts will work closely with experts-in-training, with a focus on species from the Caribbean coast of Panama that are known to be in particular need of taxonomic revision. Part B will provide training workshops for graduate students and junior researchers interested in developing taxonomic expertise in one of 6 focal groups; enabling them to (1) identify species in the field, (2) efficiently collect and preserve material for subsequent taxonomic work, (3) use existing keys or monographs to identify material to species, and (4) develop personal connections with a global network of other students and specialists. Part C will make the basic skills and vocabulary involved in the taxonomy of all 6 groups globally accessible to both expert and non-specialist workers in biodiversity and conservation. This part will develop a standard package of internet-based tools for each group, including a set of how-to videos and illustrated definitions of technical terms, with translations into several languages.

While the short rains season has stronger interannual variability and stronger links to El Nino, the long rains have experienced a decline between the periods 1999-2009 and 1980-1998. This decadal trend in rainfall has been linked to increasing SST in the Indian Ocean, which in turn  has been attributed to anthropogenic climate change.  However, climate change simulations from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project version 3 (CMIP3) show a robust projection that East Africa will become wetter over the 21st century.  The climate processes which drive the long rains and their interannual variability are not well understood, and a  better understanding of these processes could help to determine whether the model projections are credible, and what factors lead to the dichotomy between long-term model projections and the shorter-term observed trend. The research is divided into three tasks: 1) Identifying the key features of the anomalous large- and regional-scale atmospheric and sea surface temperature (SST) patterns that are linked to observed seasonal rainfall variability and its recent decline in East Africa; 2) Employing climate model simulations and idealized climate model experiments to discern the main drivers of the observed features and changes; and 3) Identifying dynamical and thermodynamical processes in climate model projections associated with changes in long rains precipitation in East Africa during the twenty-first century in the CMIP5 experiments, contrasting results with those found in analysis of CMIP3 experiments.<br/><br/>East Africa is one of the most food-insecure regions of the globe, and a better understanding of the causes of drought and the likelihood of future rainfall change could play a critical role for the development of the region.

The Collaboratory seeks to address and reframe the gap between research and practice in K-12 STEM education.  This gap persists despite decades of work by many leading organizations, associations, and individuals.  Attempts to close the gap have generally focused on creating resources and mechanisms that first explain or illustrate ""what research says"" and then invite educators to access and integrate findings into practice.  Recently, however, attention has turned to the ways in which the medical sciences are addressing the gap between research and clinical practice through the developing field of ""translational research.""  In medicine, the strategy has been to shift the focus from adoption to adaptation of research into practice.  Implicit in the notion of adaptation is a bi-directional process of cultural exchange in which both researchers and practitioners come to understand how the knowledge products of each field can strengthen the professional activities in the other.  Along these lines, the R+P Collaboratory is working with leading professional associations and STEM improvement efforts to leverage their existing knowledge and experience and to build sustainable strategies for closing the gap.  Activities include:<br/><br/>     -  Collecting, creating and synthesizing translational research resources to expand STEM educators' and educational leaders' access and awareness to current relevant research.<br/>     -  Supporting multiple opportunities for cross-sector (research and practice; education and social sciences; formal and informal) meetings to foster critical engagement and cultural exchange. <br/>     -  Testing, documenting and innovating new resources and mechanisms at Adaptation Sites and disseminating both products and results through the R+P Resource Center. <br/><br/>The R+P Collaboratory is developing an online 'Go-To' Resource Center website that houses the resources collected, created, and curated by the Collaboratory.  The Resource Center also has significant 'Take-Out' features, with all materials meta-tagged so that they can be automatically uploaded, reformatted, and integrated into the existing communication and professional development mechanisms (e.g., newsletters, digests, conferences, and websites) of a dozen leading professional associations within a Professional Association Partner Network.<br/><br/>In light of new and emerging standards in the STEM disciplines, the Collaboratory is focusing its work on four salient and timely bodies of research: (a) STEM Practices, (b) Formative Assessment, (c) Cyberlearning, and (d) Learning as a Cross-Setting Phenomenon.  Special emphasis is being placed on research and practice that focuses on the learning of children and youth from communities historically underrepresented in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The work of the R+P Collaboratory includes research and evaluation of its own efforts through studies aimed at answering the following questions:<br/>     -  How are Collaboratory resources and engagement activities accessed, experienced and leveraged by participants?<br/>     -  What resources, mechanisms and learning contexts support cultural exchange among STEM education researchers and practitioners?<br/>     -  What new kinds of practices result when research-based evidence is adapted into evidence-based practices, and how does it change learning opportunities for K-12 aged children?<br/>     -  How can effective strategies, mechanisms and resources of the Collaboratory be scaled and adapted to new contexts?"

To date scientists do not have a proxy for low but non-zero oxygen conditions -- the sort of conditions that are likely to have dominated in biologically important periods of Earth history.  In this project, researchers will study the relationship between bottom water oxygen concentration and the isotopes of the trace metal vanadium (V) in a range of oxygen conditions in the modern ocean.  Based on pilot data, theoretical calculations and dissolved seawater V concentrations they believe that stable V isotope ratios of core top sediments will correlate systematically over a range of bottom water oxygen conditions.  By analyzing these materials, the research team expects to establish the relationship between V isotopes and bottom water oxygen concentrations.  Given the importance of chemical proxies to quantify past climate change, the results of this study will be of great importance to the modern and paleoceanographic community, as well as for modelers to better understand a broad range of oxygen variability in Earth history.<br/><br/>Although recent investigations have provided a wealth of information about the redox conditions of the ancient oceans, there is a significant gap in understanding low oxygen conditions throughout Earth history. Therefore, it is important to develop new paleoredox proxies that can provide additional and complementary knowledge about ocean redox conditions during these important periods of Earth history.  In this study, scientists will analyze bulk sediments and their organic and ferromanganese mineral fractions to investigate the V isotopic variability within the various sedimentary components.  (These samples comprise organic rich to ferromanganese rich sediments due to a range in bottom water oxygen concentrations.)  Reconstructing marine low oxygen conditions using vanadium isotopes would fill a void in the paleoredox proxy toolbox.  Developing, calibrating, and fingerprinting the V isotopic variability in modern sediments is required to be able to apply vanadium isotopes as an accurate paleoredox proxy."

The goal of this project is to acquire an ultra-small-angle X-ray scattering (USAXS) instrument to investigate materials relevant to a range of multidisciplinary applications, including organic solar cells, passivating metallic films, nanostructured membranes, carbon nanotubes, nanoparticles and catalysts. The common theme in these research activities is the need to accurately explore hierarchical structure from the nano- to the meso-scale, since correlations between multiple length-scales give rise to unique functionalities that determine performance. The USAXS project meets this need by quantitatively probing critical length-scale domains, and complements existing resources such as wide-angle scattering, pinhole small-angle scattering, light scattering and x-ray reflectivity. The project thus transforms materials-related research at the University of Dayton and various other users in the south-west Ohio region (Miami University, Procter & Gamble, Environmental Protection Agency, Clopay Plastics) by providing scientists with quantitative structural data covering length scales from 5 nm to 1 micrometer."

Although research from other fields has demonstrated the value of examining the artifacts generated during research and design, there are as yet no ethnographic studies of the day-to-day practices of interdisciplinary teams in engineering education settings and the objects they create and use in those practices. Therefore, this study is significant because it fundamentally advances knowledge of interdisciplinary teamwork by developing a typology of boundary negotiating artifacts (BNAs) in interdisciplinary engineering teams. BNAs are artifacts and practices surrounding them that coordinate perspectives, create alignment between team members from different disciplines, facilitate transmission of information, and allow team members to learn from other disciplines during research and design. The project addresses a significant gap in knowledge about the actual practices and artifacts generated during the course of interdisciplinary design projects. By focusing on the daily, micro-level practices of engineers, a fuller, more accurate description of communication processes emerges than those based on interviews and normative descriptions of engineering work. Characterizing the artifacts that facilitate or hinder collaboration ultimately contributes to engineers' abilities to work with stakeholders from other backgrounds as successful boundary-spanners. This study's contribution is significant because it provides the first research-based educational materials that are designed to improve interdisciplinary design teamwork and communication through the use of an artifacts typology. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are: 1) to characterize the ways in which use and non-use of artifacts facilitates and hinders interdisciplinary teamwork and communication, 2) to develop a typology of models of artifacts created and utilized in interdisciplinary teams, and 3) to design, implement, and assess explicit incorporation of BNAs into interdisciplinary engineering courses at Washington State University and Oregon State University. Understanding the roles and uses of artifacts in interdisciplinary communication requires collecting data through long term, ethnographically-informed methods. Participant observers are collecting ethnographic data from several interdisciplinary design projects. Ethnographic data include observations and interviews with students and faculty members. Based on results from the ethnographic data, a typology of BNAs and their uses is being developed. Organizing the data in this manner allows other researchers and instructors access into the project's findings. Utilizing results of the research, BNAs are being strategically incorporated into engineering curricula to optimize their use and effectiveness. Together, these outcomes build a vital and solid foundation for future research on interdisciplinary communication processes and associated improvement of interdisciplinary design courses."

If WIMPs are the dark matter, they may be detectable when they scatter in Earth-based detectors. Direct detection of WIMP dark matter would solve a fundamental mystery in particle physics and cosmology, providing a unique window to learning about the primary matter constituent of the Universe and of physics beyond the Standard Model of particle physics.

These projects will also result in technical training in radiation detection, cryogenics, and gas purification for graduate and undergraduate students. LXe has practical applications to gamma ray imaging for astrophysics, Homeland Security, and medical imaging. There are frequent tours of the facility and presentations on the underground experiments for the region's schools and college classes, and they maintain strong outreach efforts to the region's American Indian Colleges and Tribal Councils.<br/><br/>Located in the Sanford Underground Research Facility (SURF) in Lead, South Dakota, LUX has a fiducial mass of about 100 kg and promises substantially improved sensitivity to the WIMP model.

In this study, the PI will take advantage of a recent extreme cold weather event, the southward incursion of the polar vortex during the winter of 2013-2014, to extend his ongoing studies of the mechanistic underpinnings of thermogenic performance in high- and low-elevation populations of deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus). The PI's current research efforts (recently recommend for funding by NSF - IOS 1354934) are aimed at applying systems-biology approaches to develop and parameterize hierarchical computational models of the adaptive modification aerobic thermogenic capacity. In this study, he will complement these mechanistic insights with direct estimates of the strength of natural selection acting on various traits that influence whole-organism thermogenic performance. The brutal winter of 2013/2014 represents an extreme selective episode acting on thermogenic performance in small, winter-active endotherms like deer mice. As a result, the researchers have a unique opportunity to evaluate the strength of natural selection acting on traits that influence whole-organism thermogenic performance in the wild, and to directly incorporate data on selection intensities into their integrative analysis of the evolution of thermogenic performance. This study will provide key insights into the mechanisms underlying rapid phenotypic and evolutionary responses to severe climatic events.<br/><br/>Although many studies have documented phenotypic changes in response to putative selective episodes, none have used detailed mechanistic insights to predict which phenotypic traits are likely to be the targets of natural selection on this scale. The PIs ongoing mechanistic analysis of thermogenic performance will allow him to identify phenotypic and regulatory changes that are most likely to influence O2 flux and overall thermogenic capacity, while the work proposed in this study will allow the researchers to make direct connections between the intensity of selection acting on a trait and quantitative analysis of its regulatory control over pathway flux. The researchers will use  shifts in phenotypic trait means to formally estimate selection differentials acting various subordinate traits and regulatory network states that influence thermogenic performance under hypoxia. The combination of these lab and field studies will make important strides toward an integrated evolutionary systems biology framework for understanding adaptive variation in complex physiological traits."

This is a project to investigate the scientifically and societally important issue of radiation belt electron dynamics.  The emphasis in this research will be on understanding the losses of electrons that occur during magnetic storms.  These are significant in that the flux of relativistic electrons decreases by an order of magnitude in a few hours. There are two possible explanations for this: One is loss to the solar wind through the magnetopause and the other is loss to the atmosphere due to precipitation. The former is relatively easy to evaluate but the latter is much more difficult because the loss cone is small in the magnetosphere and because satellite observations provide a limited picture. This proposal will apply a creative approach combining satellite observations from the Van Allen Probes and NOAA POES satellites and a new Drift-Diffusion simulation to quantify the losses. The team will start by determining which observed events are candidates for magnetopause loss, which are candidates for precipitation loss and which are combinations of both types of loss. Then they will use the observations and the simulation iteratively to improve the simulation.  They will determine the pitch angle diffusion coefficients as a function of magnetic local time and from that the local time and L shell (radial) dependence of the plasma waves responsible for the precipitation. They will compare this with Van Allen Probes wave observations. They plan a detailed calibration of the POES observations and those from the NSF Colorado Student Space Weather Experiment (CSSWE).<br/>Understanding electron dynamics is important societally for understanding space weather. In addition this project will support a young woman scientist and a graduate student. Finally the detailed calibration of the POES and CSSWE data will be useful well beyond this application."

Although a number of pathways have been described that confer specific protection to various abiotic and biotic challenges, a recent discovery of a potentially universal protective mechanism involving the Small Ubiquitin-related MOdifier (SUMO) may transform the current appreciation of stress biology. Specifically, it has been shown that the Arabidopsis SUMO polypeptide becomes covalently attached to numerous nuclear proteins and that the levels of these conjugates rise rapidly and reversibly after exposing plants to various abiotic stresses. Using novel quantitative proteomic approaches, it has been discovered that many of the SUMOylation targets are known critical regulators with their collective functions implying that SUMO addition engages a protective response that broadly alters chromatin accessibility, transcription, and mRNA processing/export.  Taken together, these results suggest that SUMO might offer unique opportunities to globally manipulate the stress response for agricultural benefit. Unfortunately, the organization and functions of the SUMO system are largely unknown in other plant species, including all important agricultural crops, thus precluding rational redesign to improve crop plant productivity. Moreover, preliminary genome analyses of maize and rice revealed that the organization of the SUMO system in cereals might differ significantly from that in observed in Arabidopsis. This EAGER project proposes to define how SUMOylation works during stress in crops using maize (Zea mays) as the model. The specific aims are to: (i) delineate the SUMOylation system in maize using bioinformatic and biochemical methods and define kinetically how the system responds to stress; (ii) generate a library of maize mutants and transgenic lines affecting key components required for SUMO addition and release; (iii) define the ""SUMOylome"" of maize, quantify how the SUMOylation status of individual targets changes during stress and after recovery; and (iv) analyze SUMO pathway mutants phenotypically to determine how stress-induced SUMOylation may help maize survive adverse environments. Collectively, this project will generate much-needed tools and germplasm that can be exploited to understand how SUMO might reorganize maize chromatin and its transcriptome during stress, and identify key points in plant stress responses involving SUMOylation that can be manipulated for improved yield.<br/><br/>The current understanding of SUMOylation in plants is still rudimentary and almost nonexistent in crop species where its manipulation may have substantial agricultural impact. This project will provide interdisciplinary training of the next generation of plant scientists working on crops. This research will collectively incorporate postdocs, graduate students, and undergraduates as well as high school students sponsored by the Wisconsin Youth Apprenticeship Program (YAP) in Biotechnology.  During the course of this project, reagents, techniques, mutants, and transgenic lines will be generated that will provide a much needed foundation to investigate SUMOylation in maize, and hopefully offer new strategies to rationally alter the SUMO system for agricultural and medicinal benefit.  Plant resources will be available through the Maize Genetics Cooperative Stock Center (http://maizecoop.cropsci.uiuc.edu).  Raw and processed experimental data will be deposited into NCBI's Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) and at Maize GDB (http://www.maizegdb.org/)."

This is achieved by the creation of a curriculum that accommodates students of different levels of computer literacy, that focuses on experiential learning, and that utilizes institutional collaboration via cloud computing. This project will mitigate the challenges small institutions currently face in the cybersecurity area, for example, a tight computer science curriculum and the inability to support the expensive infrastructure required for cybersecurity education.  Integrated into this project is research as to whether using this new curriculum and the related online projects, students will attain the same, or an increase, level of cybersecurity learning.  <br/><br/>This project will address the above challenges by creating a range of cybersecurity learning opportunities that emphasize hands-on and realistic experimentation for students in small institutions. First, this project will attract a diverse population of students by introducing cybersecurity topics through multiple paths of study and engagement. Students will be introduced to cybersecurity concepts through manageable, stand alone course modules and laboratory exercises. Interested students can study further by taking two cybersecurity focused courses and cybersecurity capstone projects created by this project. Using all these materials students can create a cybersecurity concentration. Second, the project will use the Global Environment for Network Innovation (GENI) infrastructure in the development of empirical labs and the capstone project assignments.  GENI offers an affordable cloud solution to small institutions that lack the infrastructure to support sophisticated computer labs. The learning impact of the new curriculum will be evaluated by quantitative competency assessments that are administered yearly.  Student cybersecurity persistence will be assessed by a longitudinal study of the number of  cybersecurity courses taken during a student's course of study. Qualitative assessment of the curriculum will take the form of student interviews and focus groups to gauge attitude towards course modules, perception of learning gains and comfort level with the pedagogies employed. In addition to the collaboration of three college level institutions, this project will leverage relationships with local community colleges to further develop a cybersecurity workforce.  This partnership provides a diverse set of students that will support the evidence-based evaluation of student cybersecurity learning via this approach."

In physics, they are used to describe the space-time in Einstein's theory of general relativity. In mathematics, they are basic building blocks of more complicated geometries. The study of Einstein manifolds is thus a basic problem in geometry. One effective way to construct Einstein manifolds is to require that the underlying manifold has a complex algebraic structure. In other words, the points of such a manifold are complex-valued solutions of polynomial equations. Einstein metrics on such algebraic manifolds are called Kaehler-Einstein metrics. In the late 70s, Aubin and Yau constructed Kaehler-Einstein metrics with negative Ricci curvatures. Yau also constructed Kaehler-Einstein metrics with zero Ricci curvatures, which are now called Calabi-Yau metrics and play important roles in the string theory of physics. On the other hand, only recently has people pinned down a sufficient and necessary condition, called K-stability, for the existence of Kaehler-Einstein metrics with positive Ricci curvatures for a class of algebraic manifolds called Fano manifolds. This result depends on the work of many people, most importantly by Tian and Donaldson. After these discoveries, we want to further our understandings of such Kaehler-Einstein metrics and the obstructions to their existence. These problems are the main concerns of the proposal. The study of these Kaehler-Einstein metrics will greatly improve our understanding of Einstein manifolds important in both physics and mathematics. <br/><br/>In this proposal, the PI will study the following closely related problems. 1.Various continuity methods of partial differential equations are used to solve the Kaehler-Einstein equation. The recent breakthroughs give qualitative pictures of blow up behaviors and convergences of these continuity methods. However, deeper quantitative understandings of the blow up behaviors or singularity forming phenomena are needed. The PI has studied in detail such quantitative properties for toric Fano manifolds. The PI will study the singularities forming processes for a broader class of Fano manifolds. The PI will also study the classification of the singularities formed in low dimensions by combining the methods from Riemannian geometry and algebraic geometry. 2.The PI will study concrete constructions of Kaehler-Einstein metrics and related canonical metrics. On the one hand, the PI likes to extend the construction of toric Kaehler-Einstein metrics to other Kaehler-Einstein metrics with large symmetries, for example, on spherical varieties. On the other hand, the PI will study the classification of Sasaki-Einstein metrics with large symmetries in low dimensions based on his calculations of important examples. Related methods will also be applied to construct Kaehler-Ricci solitons and extremal Kaehler metrics. 3.The PI will study the deformations of canonical Kaehler metrics including Kaehler-Einstein metrics and Kaehler-Ricci solitons, and to understand the moduli spaces of these canonical Kaehler metrics. He will also study the singularities on the boundaries of these moduli spaces. 4.The PI and his collaborator will study the K-stability using algebraic geometry based on their previous work on K-stability. They will use tools from minimal model program to test K-stability. This will allow us to get Kaehler-Einstein metrics using algebro-geometric methods."

When the material is not part of the design strategy, there is both an intrinsic risk and an opportunity lost. With respect to risk, such legacy materials may exhibit properties that are inferior to the same material prepared using conventional approaches. For example, when Ti-6-4 is arbitrarily selected for additive manufacturing processes, the resultant material exhibits properties that vary according to both testing direction and spatial location. With respect to the lost opportunity, there are unique characteristics of the additive manufacturing processes, such as very high solidification rates, that can result in superior properties for the right materials.  Thus, there is a need to design new materials that leverage the unique characteristics of additive manufacturing processes to achieve a balance of properties that exceeds what is currently possible when legacy materials are used. The titanium alloys developed under this Designing Materials to Revolutionize and Engineer our Future (DMREF) program, as well as the general framework of accelerated alloy development, will be disseminated through a series of industry dissemination workshops. This dissemination will impact a wide range of economic sectors, including, for example, aerospace, automotive, and biomedical.<br/><br/>Technical:  This project is directed toward the design of a modern creep-resistant beta-titanium alloy to be produced via additive manufacturing. This will be achieved by integrating high-throughput combinatorial materials science, state-of-the-art materials characterization, computational materials science, and data-science. The project seeks to: (1) discover and model the fundamental interrelationship between the far-from equilibrium conditions of additive manufacturing processes and materials composition on the resulting microstructure and properties; (2) fully describe the materials composition and structure using multi-dimensional, multi-spatial, and multi-spectral approaches; (3) determine, via powerful data science approaches, hidden correlations (e.g., mechanisms) between composition, structure, and properties as assessed using both computational and experimental techniques; (4) validate the mechanisms via computational modeling and critical experimentation; and (5) design, as a multi-university team, a new material for additive manufacturing processes. Along the way, the team will develop both an ontology and data science standards so that the information can be shared easily amongst the four universities during the program and disseminated more broadly at the conclusion of the effort."

Transition metal oxides offer superior performance as electrodes for lithium-ion batteries; however, the progress toward their commercial use has been hindered due to lack of understanding of their electrochemical performance.  In particular, variations in local atomic structure and chemistry need to be better investigated in order to properly design them for rechargeable battery applications. With support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, this project will work to address this shortcoming. The principal investigator plans to study the electrochemical battery reactions inside high-resolution electron microscopes enabling imaging down to atomic level. With this capability, lithium-ion movements inside the battery electrodes can be investigated in the presence of structural defects.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Nanoscale transition metal oxides (TMO) are promising materials for lithium-ion batteries. These materials operate through conversion reactions and are associated with high energy densities. These materials are highly vulnerable to structural defects produced during synthesis that can alter lithium ion pathways and affect their electrochemical performance. The objective of this research activity is to understand the underlying atomistic mechanisms by which structural defects such as heterointerfaces and dislocations affect the lithiation behavior of TMOs. To meet this goal, nanoscale TMOs are subjected to real time electrochemical lithiation inside atomic-resolution transmission electron microscopes. This project is expected to yield better understanding on the evolution of localized strain and electronic structure at the vicinity of structural defects and their effect on lithium-ion pathways. In addition, the structural evolution of conversion reaction phases can be investigated in the presence of heterointerfaces and dislocations."

Tremendous effort has been spent studying fouling mechanisms during microfiltration; however, membrane fouling control by backwashing and air scouring remain largely unexplored topics. This work builds upon the PIs significant past collaborations to develop models of membrane processes. The proposed research will yield a rigorous mathematical framework along with systematic experimental validation to maximize microfiltration water productivity by maintaining high flux with periodic regeneration and electrocoagulation/flocculation pretreatment. This project provides a unique perspective to train students at all levels in multidisciplinary studies and broadening participation in science and engineering. <br/><br/>The proposed research represents a synergistic collaboration between an experimentalist with expertise in membrane filtration and a mathematician with long-term expertise in modeling, fluid dynamics, and optimal control to make potentially transformative contributions to fouling control. The PIs tackle the problem of maximizing the cumulative volume of surface water filtered by hollow-fiber microfiltration incorporating periodic regeneration using optimal control theory. This study also includes sensitivity analysis and data assimilation, complementary mathematical processes used to quantify aspects of variability that arise in both theoretical and experimental studies due to underlying stochastic processes, uncertainty in measurements, or errors in approximations. Complementary laboratory measurements are aimed at generating necessary data for model validation as well as novel interfacial chemical characterization, to discern the sequence of mechanisms that lead to (ir)reversible fouling. Additionally, experiments and modeling will encompass Lake Houston water pretreated using an innovative electrochemical process, namely electrocoagulation with sacrificial aluminum electrodes. The underlying mathematical approach requires specific experimental measurements to determine sensitivity rankings for parameters (and hence physical quantities), statistical likelihood estimates for parameter distributions, and advanced optimal control analysis. Similarly, the experimental approach requires predictions such as key parameter regimes to explore, specific areas of uncertainty that can be reduced, and validation experiments to consolidate the real-world behavior with the mathematical predictions. This is facilitated by seamless collaboration, established over the past seven years or so, that brings together substantial experience on experimental and theoretical aspects to the project. Input will also be obtained from external stakeholders including a membrane manufacturer (Pall Corporation) and a water purveyor (Orange County Water District) who will provide hollow fibers as well as operational data from their long-term pilot-studies. They will also evaluate our methods and results to attempt to increase the productivity during low-pressure membrane filtration."

The researchers will study interperson, multifrequency coordination by applying the physics of coupled, oscillator systems to the perceptual, cognitive, and social information inherent in this type of coordination. Pairs of participants (dyads) will coordinate their movements while listening to different metronome frequencies through headphones.  Both performance pattern and pattern stability will be measured under different experimental conditions in order to test fundamental predictions of the mathematical model.  Experimental manipulations specifically designed to increase or decrease coupling between dyads' movements will be tested in the context of perceptual (e.g., visual), cognitive (e.g., counting), and social (e.g., partner familiarity) coupling mechanisms.  Field studies are also planned to discover how people coordinate in naturalistic situations.  This sequence of studies is designed to advance basic research on multifrequency coordination in dyads and to extend that research to spontaneous coordination in larger teams.<br/><br/>One important aspect of this project is the extension of experimentally induced multifrequency coordination in the laboratory to real-world settings in which spontaneous multifrequency coordination occurs across teams of individuals.

The debates and the government policies have their modern origins in the Great Depression and New Deal.   The national and most state governments face continuing and future budgetary problems based on pension and health care promises that are currently underfunded.  The 1930s offer the most relevant historical example to the current situation, as tax revenues at all levels dropped in the early 1930s, demands on state governments expanded, and the federal government provided a large amount of new funding to the states and established a host of policies.  The states themselves began a fiscal revolution that expanded their capacity to generate revenue and the interactions between the national and state governments changed in ways that expanded the long run economic responsibilities of national and state governments in the economy.   Thus, understanding how these policies were established in the 1930s can provide numerous insights into the modern policy issues. <br/> The Census Bureau stopped compiling state financial statistics during the years 1932 through 1936, leaving a gaping hole in a series that runs from 1915 to the present.  This gap in the state fiscal data occurs precisely during the key years when modern state government policies were going through a fiscal revolution in response to the Depression and the New Deal.  Our goal is to fill the gap by going directly to the reports of Treasurers and Auditors in each state to collect the financial data from 1930 through 1940.  When the project is completed, we will have developed a panel data set that covers the period from 1915 through 1940 for the 48 contiguous states with information on total state revenues and expenditures, as well as with information on several revenue and expenditure categories.  This panel will be matched up with a  panel data set from 1919 through 1940 that contains information on state income per capita, farm activity, manufacturing activity, births, deaths, banking activity, federal spending in multiple categories, federal tax revenue in multiple categories, highway mileage built, construction in a variety of categories, weather, the political makeup of state legislatures and the governorship, and election results for congressional, presidential and gubernatorial elections.<br/>The broader impact of this proposal can be seen through the questions we will answer using this data. Some of the questions we plan to address are:  Did the increased national government grants and loans encourage additional state spending and revenue or did the states respond by allowing the national spending to crowd out state spending and reduce tax collections?   To what extent did the states introduce new types of taxes and new forms of expenditures in the 1920s and 1930s and what were the factors that led them to choose the specific forms?   What was the impact of state deficits and surpluses on state economic activity after controlling for national spending?"

As part of the Southern Oxidant and Aerosol Study (SOAS) the principal investigators (PIs) planned comprehensive laboratory and field studies focused on improving the detailed mechanistic understanding of the processes controlling OH and isoprene, the most important VOC, especially in rural environments.

It will provide the fundamental information required for designing, constructing, optimizing, and scaling up of an algae-based power system that will significantly contribute to the energy requirements of houses or residential communities. The project proposes the following aims: a) Evaluate the bench-scale feasibility of the technology through compositional analysis of various residential waste streams, determining biochemical methane potentials, calculating specific growth rates and biomass yields of local algae strains, and processing the cultivated biomass into biofuels. Process modeling software will employ comprehensive mass and energy balances to develop the descriptive and predictive understanding of system parameters necessary to design, construct and operate a pilot-scale system in both open- and closed-loop modes; b) Determine the interrelationships of architectural design and planning parameters for the algae-powered house at the rural, suburban, and urban scales using the design studio and GIS to test hypotheses and develop novel scenarios; and c) Evaluate elements of integration, constructability, reliability, safety and environmental impact on the use of the algae-based technology in residential structures using a comprehensive economic risk and feasibility assessment to investigate the costs of installation, training, operation, material transfer, maintenance, and evaluation of selected technologies.<br/><br/>The economic analysis described in aim 3 above includes comprehensive surveys that will elicit public perceptions and tolerance for the costs associated with sustainable housing incorporating integrated material and energy flows.

The foundation of economic activity and growth is in the ability of individuals to trust and trade with each other over time. Throughout human history, much of economic activity occurs in realms where formal legal institutions are unwilling or unsuited to enforce cooperative behavior. In such circumstances, more informal kinds of enforcement can encourage cooperation and honest dealing.  Past research suggests that the networked pattern of social relationships plays a key role in this kind of informal enforcement.  Suppose someone cheats on an agreement.  The cheater will be punished not just by his partners in the agreement but by others who learn about the cheating through friends, colleagues, and business partners.  This specific research program uses economic theory and laboratory experiments to study how communities enforce cooperation through their social networks. <br/><br/>The modeling framework is a novel synthesis of repeated games and social networks: the PIs study a society of long-lived individuals whose connection in a social network embodies an ongoing productive relationship with moral hazard.  The research team is developing a new modeling framerwork that permits individuals to set the stakes of their partnerships: higher stakes lead to higher cooperation payoffs but increase the temptation to shirk even more. Over time, each player observes only the behavior in her own partnerships. <br/><br/>The first part of this project develops a theory of network-based contagion equilibria in which deviations from a cooperative arrangement spread contagiously in a community. The researchers  extend previous results on contagion to our network setting, and show that contagion equilibria generally exist, and in certain cases are efficient.  They are able to use their construction of contagion equilibria to analyze how the demands of cooperation shape social architecture: which social network delivers the greatest cooperation? <br/><br/>The second part of this project studies an alternative form of informal enforcement in which individuals who deviate are ostracized by others, but innocent players are not punished. Towards understanding ostracism, the PIs develop a theory of community enforcement with communication. Peliminary results indicate that permanent ostracism is ineffective, as it fails to provide appropriate communication incentives, but that that temporary ostracism?in which a guilty player is readmitted to cooperative society on paying a fine?is more effective. Similarly, ostracism may be effective if players have a particular form of interdependent preferences: they feel sympathetic towards a player cheated by another, and are willing to make a transfer to the victim.  Finally, the PIs will conduct laboratory decision experiments to test whether or not actual people do have this particular kind of sympathy for others.  <br/><br/>Broader impacts: This work will help shed light on the arrangements and institutions seen in developing and transitional economies, as well as historically. By rigorously studying the limits of cooperation in a networked society, our work will illuminate the role that informational intermediaries (services like notarization, credit reporting, and auditing) play in supporting cooperation. Understanding the significance of social networks in informal governance will help social scientists and policymakers understand how communities build social capital and trust."

Low temperature scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) is one of the best methods to probe the electronic structure of complex materials, which often exhibit nanoscale inhomogeneities. STM will be used to study correlated spin-orbit materials such as the pyrochlore and Ruddlesden-Popper series of iridates, or the Heusler compounds. Progress in understanding fundamental properties of these systems may lead to new paradigms in spin-orbit coupled complex systems. With close feedback from theory collaborators and quick turn around in obtaining single crystal and thin film samples, the group will rapidly be able to explore a variety of materials in search of novel phases. The integrated education activities include a new structured department-wide mentoring plan for post-docs, and involvement of undergraduates in research, which will help train the next generation of scientists, as well as an ongoing outreach program through the School of Education, which will have a measurable impact on the numbers of trained science teachers in middle- and high schools.<br/><br/>****Non-Technical Abstract****<br/>A new and exciting frontier in the exploring the physics of electrons and atoms in solids is the exploration of materials where there is more than one dominating interaction. Spin-orbit coupling is an interaction between the quantum mechanical spin of an electron and its orbital properties. When spin-orbit interaction is strong, materials are known to show novel effects. However, adding electron-electron interactions to these systems can vastly expand the range of novel properties. While there have been many recent theoretical studies on the possible new states in such materials, very few experimental studies have been carried out so far. Moreover, none of the intriguing predicted phases has as yet been experimentally observed. This project focuses on the fundamental physics of materials where with multiple interactions, which can either compete or aid one another. To study these materials we will use the tool of scanning tunneling microscopy, which has the power to not only image single atoms but also to move individual atoms to build artificial atomic scale structures. Any discoveries of novel states and understanding their properties will be vital to advancing our knowledge in this new field. This project will support graduate students and post-docs who will learn experimental techniques and the physics of materials at the cutting edge of current research."
