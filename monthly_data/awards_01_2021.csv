To address this fundamental challenge, this CAREER project seeks to produce light on-demand at any depth or location inside the body via noninvasive ultrasound, thus realizing ?light sculpting? in the body with user-defined patterns. The investigator?s group will use this method for spatially and temporally precise gene editing in deep tissue. The scientific outcomes of this CAREER project will enable the broadening participation of the Investigator and his group in a multitude of education activities. These education activities include K-12 outreach and teacher training, long-term mentorship to pre-college students, and hands-on lab internships. <br/><br/>The overarching career goal of the investigator is to bridge the gap in knowledge and eliminate the barrier between the physical and life sciences. Towards this goal, this CAREER project aims to develop a circulation deliverable and rechargeable light source under an engineered ultrasound field, thereby leading to on demand ?light sculpting? in three-dimensional biological tissue and thus address the fundamental challenge of biophotonics of delivering light to a depth of more than 100 microns.  The project?s main hypothesis is that traveling mechanoluminescent nanoparticles (MLNPs) in blood circulation can act as an energy relay that transports demand generation of localized light emission by circulating MLNPs (cyan circles) and tissue-penetrant FUS (focused ultrasound) for gene editing.  The research plan is organized under three objectives: the FIRST objective is to develop a palette of rare-earth doped melilite phosphor MLNPs with tunable emission wavelengths in response to different ultrasound frequencies. With mechanistic understanding of the relationship between ultrasound pressure, emission wavelength and trap depth of MLNPs, the SECOND objective is to obtain user-defined spatiotemporal pattern of light emission in any biological tissue based on the simulated ultrasound pressure field, local hemodynamics, and the photophysical properties of blood-circulating MLNPs. The THIRD objective is to perform in vivo ""light sculpting"" with ultrasound for spatiotemporally precise gene editing in live mice, using photo switchable Cas9 and a bioluminescent reporter to assess success.  If successful, this technology can be widely extended to any application requiring a light source deep in the body, including in vivo fluorescence microscopy, deep-brain optogenetics, and photodynamic therapies to treat cancer and viral infections.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the operational culture, including staffing practices and policies, sometimes results in makerspaces that are not welcoming to certain populations, specifically women and people of color. This is a serious problem because all learners need access to modern tools, problem-based pedagogies, and real-world training so that the future STEM workforce fully engages the US population in the modern economy. This CAREER project, across three diverse settings, is situated in the opportunity to dig deeper into research on pedagogies within makerspaces as well as student-staff interactions.  This understanding can inform the development of pedagogical and instructional tools to support an inclusive makerspace environment, specifically best practices for student engagement in the makerspace, hiring and training practices for makerspace staff, policies to promote equity and inclusion, and professional development practices. The proposed work will broaden participation in engineering through the creation of more inclusive practices in makerspace environments.  <br/><br/>This CAREER research will use grounded theory to develop and propose a critical lens focused on interactions and pedagogy within university makerspaces. This purposeful and explicit focus on inclusion in university makerspaces is central to future US competitiveness; otherwise, the structural inequities that exist in higher education, specifically within engineering, will continue to be reproduced in educational environments and the future workforce.  Research points to the importance of interactions between individuals in these spaces and suggests these could be linked to an inclusive/exclusive environment. Since most students enter the space for coursework, the pedagogy matters as well. This project will be guided by the following research questions: <br/>?	How do majority and marginalized engineering students interact with makerspace staff within university makerspaces? <br/>?	What does pedagogy look like in university makerspaces?<br/>?	How do interactions and pedagogy impact who is and is not participating in university makerspaces? <br/>Findings from this study will begin to fill the void of knowledge about how pedagogical moves and interactions within university makerspaces can contribute to an inclusive environment.  Specifically, the theoretical lens created in this study can synergistically inform instructional tools and practices that will be informed by best practices in curriculum, pedagogy and evaluation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research aims to produce an accurate description and understanding of the ultraviolet divergence phenomenon. In the study of the standard model of elementary particles, for example, physicists often use Monte-Carlo simulation; the research carried out in this project aims to reveal why discrete simulation can accurately predict the behavior of a continuous quantum field, how quickly dynamical algorithms will converge to the quantity being observed, and to what degree a homogenized approximation can effectively describe the macroscopic nature of a many-body problem. The project also includes two educational components, focusing on rejuvenation of the Graduate Student Probability Conference (GSPC), which is entirely run by graduate students primarily from the US, and a Stochastic Partial Differential Equations (SPDE) education program that is vertically integrated across the full spectrum of academic research. The GSPC and the SPDE education program seek sustained long-term benefit to the future generations of the probability community.<br/> <br/>The project focuses on studying the properties of the solutions of some singular stochastic partial differential equations. In recent years, there has been rapid progress in the construction of the solutions of these equations, and the project aims to study the properties of the solutions that have been constructed. Specifically, the investigator will study the universal limits of the stochastic Yang-Mills equation and explore the connections between stochastic partial differential equations, large-N problems in quantum field theory, and the theory of mean field limits. Recently developed theory of solutions will play a central role. The PI aims to develop rigorous proofs for results that make practical predictions. These studies are anticipated to result in profound connections with physics and even to influence other natural sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This barrier stems from an inability to upgrade, re-design, or integrate wastewater and drinking water treatment approaches without compromising public health or incurring unacceptably high financial or environmental costs. The research plan will generate a foundation of data, understanding, tools, and processes to advance widespread adoption of sustainable and resilient water reuse strategies. It will create a comprehensive assessment framework that integrates sustainability and resilience principles to help identify hidden barriers and important tradeoffs. It allows for the integration of wastewater and drinking water process models by establishing an expanded set of variables through experimentation and modeling. It characterizes the safe operating space of existing and novel water reuse technologies as well as demarcates a decision space that accounts for the stakeholder data that will be collected to improve understanding of diverse perspectives. Finally, the project will develop effective new teaching approaches via a rigorous multi-year, iterative effort to improve decision- making skill sets and retention.<br/><br/>The research plan starts by building an understanding of the scope of reuse options by evaluating the performance of a portfolio of technologies to (1) elucidate the safe operating spaces of existing and novel water reuse technologies across a landscape of possible designs and operational conditions. Next, it expands beyond technology performance to (2) establish a comprehensive, quantitative assessment framework and integrates it with reuse process modelling and stakeholder perspectives in an adaptable decision-support model. Finally, it takes advantage of the integrated decision-support model by conducting a scenario analysis to (3) identify salient features and characteristics of sustainable water reuse applications, and seeks to leverage this insight to elucidate drivers, barriers, and levers of change. The applicability and adoption of the proposed research efforts will be enhanced by improved stakeholder engagement and engineering student training. The research objectives are combined with integral education and outreach objectives to: (1) improve communication and understanding of diverse perspectives, and (2) foster an ability to navigate uncertainty and tradeoffs. Outreach efforts include soliciting and incorporating input through a series of workshops, case studies, and online surveys from a diverse range of stakeholders (public consumers, industrial consumers, engineers, researchers, regulators, and utilities). Education efforts include evaluating different approaches to improve understanding of uncertainty and tradeoffs, in multiple contexts, by developing and assessing the effectiveness of undergraduate environmental engineering teaching modules and by developing a ?wicked problems? card game.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The investigator and collaborator will study these connections in models of various physical systems such as tornados, shock waves, water-oil mixtures, and plasma in tokamak fusion reactors. Results of the research are intended to lead to advances in understanding of these and other important systems. In connection with the research, the investigators plan to develop graduate topics courses, undergraduate directed study courses, research activities for undergraduate students, and workshops for practicing mathematicians. <br/><br/>One of the fundamental questions in partial differential equations is the development of a unified theory of gas dynamics connecting the mesoscopic Boltzmann equations to the macroscopic fluid models (hydrodynamic limits) that arise in formal limits, and the Boltzmann equations to microscopic N-body problems (Grad-Boltzmann limit). In this project, the investigator and collaborator study the rigorous passage to both limits mathematically in various physical situations. The first part of the project concerns the hydrodynamic limits when free interfaces occur naturally: (i) vortex patch solutions of the incompressible Euler equation, (ii) two-species Vlasov-Boltzmann systems modeling binary fluid mixtures with sharp interface and surface tension, and (iii) shock formation in the compressible Euler equations and its kinetic approximation. The second part of the project concerns the Grad-Boltzmann limit in the presence of a thermal stochastic boundary. The investigators study the passage from the N-body Newtonian system interacting with stochastic boundary toward the Boltzmann equation with diffuse reflection boundary. They will investigate the mixing effect of such boundaries and aim to establish a rigorous passage for a time interval greater than a mean free time. They will also study the link of generic steady non-equilibrium states between the mesoscopic and microscopic levels.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to help fill this gap by improving the preparation of the needed technical workforce.  To do so, it will establish a Professional Learning program in design thinking pedagogy for secondary and postsecondary educators.  The curriculum will focus on design thinking projects that involve digital fabrication techniques, including 3D printing, laser engraving, and Computer Numerical Control milling.  The Professional Learning program is expected to improve the educator' teaching practices and enable them to update existing curricula and lesson plans to better align with industry relevant skills and techniques.  The project also intends to create a community of practice around design thinking in digital fabrication that will build a beneficial network among secondary teachers, community college faculty, makerspace educators, and regional employers.  It is expected that the project will support 36 secondary and postsecondary educators who will teach more than 3,000 K-12 and undergraduate students in the northern Virginia region.  These students will have greater interest in and be better prepared for technical careers in manufacturing and engineering.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the project is to use Professional Learning to move digital fabrication instruction beyond the reproduction of simple objects.  Instead, the project will train educators to use pedagogy and cognitive strategies to embed design thinking into their digital fabrication lessons and courses.  As a result, students will learn to use design thinking to build complex, useful objects.  The project?s specific aims include to: (1) create a professional learning institute; (2) host digital fabrication summer camps at NOVA and the Boys and Girls Club of Greater Washington; (3) host a semiannual design and digital fabrication challenge; and (4) establish an online resource library of projects and lesson plans created and refined by educators in the community of practice.   The project is expected to advance: understanding of the pedagogies that help to develop student interest in manufacturing and engineering; the capacity for Professional Learning to facilitate integration of design thinking into classrooms and makerspaces; and the extent to which a capstone design challenge may foster sustainable change in instructional practices.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Success will provide a proof-of-principle that thermodynamic control mechanisms enabled by genetically encoded biomaterials can drive chemical communication between membraneless synthetic cells.  Design rules for control of signaling and biological activity within hierarchical, aqueous multiple phase systems will be developed.

This is a framework to assess properties of estimators and statistical tests, necessary for a high level of confidence in predictions. The large sample theory, first developed for independent variables, is considerably more difficult when data is dependent, that is, when quantities have dependencies that relate their values. The questions become even more challenging when the random variations are changing with time. The goal of this research is to address these questions by developing new methods to analyze large samples selected from classes of dependent structures arising in many applied fields, such as data from economics or engineering.  <br/><br/>The aim of this project is to develop new techniques for studying sequences and fields of dependent random variables, which will lead to sharp inequalities and general limit theorems for both stationary and non-stationary additive functionals of Markov chains and other dependent structures. The PI plans to develop a new type of approximation with martingales for Markov chains and fields based on the fruitful idea of conditioning with respect to both past and future of the process. The advantage of this new, surprising method is that no restrictions on the rate of convergence to zero of the dependence coefficients is required for obtaining various limit theorems. The PI also aims to develop operator perturbation theory for non-stationary Markov chains and functions of independent random elements.

Yet, many students, especially students from underrepresented populations, perceive  STEM to be disconnected from their interests and career aspirations. New curricular approaches are needed, especially in mathematics, that increase students? career interest and engagement in STEM, while also supporting the learning of rich and targeted STEM content. In this project, researchers will develop and investigate nine design challenges built within a novel curricular framework for high school mathematics, the Design and Pitch Challenges in STEM. The Design and Pitch Challenges framework leverages entrepreneurial pitch competitions to support rich mathematics learning. Students work collaboratively to 1) build, test, and refine prototype STEM products; 2) design business plans to demonstrate product viability; and 3) pitch their products to a panel of judges. To support implementation, researchers will also build and investigate an online professional learning network for teachers. <br/><br/>This project will explore whether and how entrepreneurship, through its flexible and interest-focused approach to career applications, can be an effective means for supporting the learning of targeted mathematics content and building career connections in the mathematics classroom. The project will also investigate how to best provide ongoing support to teachers through an online professional learning network while they implement the Design and Pitch Challenges. The research team will create nine math-focused design challenges, using an iterative process in the first year, piloting the challenges with about 50-100 local students. In years two and three, the team will test the challenges more broadly through partners at the non-profit JASON Learning, implementing capstone events in which approximately 2,400 students and 30 teachers in eight diverse school districts will engage in school-wide pitch competitions. Once completed, the materials will be widely distributed through the JASON network and freely available online. Across these two phases of the study, the research team will collect and analyze qualitative and quantitative data to understand students' and teachers' experiences with the challenges and online professional learning network. This project aims to launch a new approach to the teaching and learning of high school mathematics through open-ended, entrepreneurial design challenges that allow students to explore the utility of mathematics while fostering students' career interest and engagement in STEM. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is a remarkably effective and versatile biological tool whose complex and efficient architecture has been modified for taking in food as disparate as nectar (hummingbirds) and flesh (birds of prey). The diversity of birds is, in many ways, a diversity of beaks. The beak was also integral to the evolution of bird flight: the first beaks, in the dinosaurian ancestors of birds, seem to have acted as ?surrogate hands? to replace the fingers fused and incorporated into the wing. This project will use fossils that document 300 million years of reptile evolution to determine the steps that led to the evolution of the bird beak. They will, in particular, seek to discover how pre-existing anatomical structures, especially the predatory jaws of ancient archosaurs were co-opted and rearranged to make the beak, and will search for signatures of the classic evolutionary (and engineering) phenomena of tradeoffs and co-dependencies (integration and modularity). The project also investigates how the embryonic beak is formed in modern birds and how its development differs from that of the reptilian snout ? in particular, whether comparisons of modern embryos with fossils and fossilized embryos can tell us about which parts of the bird beak form by late ?tweaking? of, or addition to, a fundamentally reptilian embryonic anatomy and which are truly ?new.? The grand narrative of the way in which birds, living dinosaurs, came to be so diverse and abundant in the modern world is naturally compelling, and the data to be generated are often striking and beautiful. The project will incorporate the findings of their work, including digital images and 3D prints of these data, into the courses they teach at Yale and into kits and curricula designed for K-12 classrooms, with a focus on low-income urban schools. Beyond exchange of materials and knowledge, the project's investigators will visit classrooms and will, moreover, conduct on-campus tours of research and collections facilities for K-12 students, many from underrepresented groups in STEM, and their teachers, with the intention of building long-term relationships with schools, teachers and students. The project also will lead to the design of exhibits featuring the discoveries from this work in part of the newly renovated Yale Peabody Museum. Finally, the project team will conduct a series of online and in-person public lectures and question-and-answer sessions throughout the duration of the project. <br/><br/>The avian beak is a marvel of biological engineering and a key innovation that enabled the radiation of birds. This project will examine the morphological assembly of the beak from stem reptiles through to crown-clade birds and, simultaneously, the embryonic assembly of the beak as compared to that of the reptilian snout. In particular, the project will test the hypothesis of co-option followed by further novelty and constraint release in the origin of the avian head from the ancestral archosaurian head, then the origin of the neognath jaw apparatus from the ancestral avian kinetic system. This will be accomplished using a combination of 3D CT imaging of fossils and extant taxa, and reconstruction of soft tissue anatomy using phylogenetic bracketing. Analyses of shape and transformation will be three-dimensional and quantitative. The project will further test hypotheses of integration and modularity of skeletal elements surrounding major soft tissue structures using a variety of methods, and in particular will elucidate constraint and tradeoffs resulting from spatial packing or competition for space. This will be accomplished by quantitatively analyzing evolutionary trajectories and developmental trajectories (in part reconstructed using high-fidelity confocal imaging of entire immunostained embryos). Finally, the project will seek to unravel the relative contributions of the distinct ontogenetic or developmental processes of terminal addition and early transformation in the evolutionary origin of the avian skull, using an integrative approach that incorporates embryos, fossils, and fossil embryos. In particular, the project will include both evolutionary sequences of reconstructed ancestors (from fossil data) and ontogenetic sequences (fossil and extant) in combined analyses and will quantitatively assess the correspondence or non-correspondence of these sequences. Ultimately, the project will present a comprehensive picture of the sequence of evolution and development leading to the distinctive avian condition, and will gain insight into the transformational phenomena and evolutionary dynamics in operation during its genesis.<br/><br/>This project was jointly funded with the Sedimentary Geology and Paleobiology Program in the Division of Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ECMs are essential to renewable, nuclear, and fossil energy generation and are included in the US government?s list of 35 ?critical materials?, yet their supply chains remain opaque and vulnerable to illicit activity. There are currently no global measurements of the licit-illicit composition of ECM trade flows or their evolution over time. To address the problem, this project seeks to map and model global ECM flows based on original research in several source, transit, and destination countries. The findings and tools developed under this study will improve discovery and traceability of illicitly sourced ECM, identify vulnerable points along several ECM supply chains, and generate predictive models of their dynamics in order to identify effective disruption strategies. The results will be informed by data drawn from open and proprietary datasets, as well as data gathered at national and subnational levels, and tested under extensive field research. The project will advance our national ability to identify vulnerabilities in the supply chains of energy-critical materials, catalyze game-changing innovative technological tools and multidisciplinary methodologies that enhance capacity for the detection and disruption of illicit activities affecting ECM supply chains. This is a key step for ensuring transparent, secure, and sustainable supply chains.<br/><br/>The project integrates methods from machine learning, remote sensing, and multilingual qualitative research to detect and disrupt illicit activities by characterizing the global illicit in several ECMs: Cobalt, Lithium, Niobium, Platinum Group Metals (PGM), Rare Earth Elements (REE), and Tantalum. Using complex systems theory within a telecoupling framework, the project will (1) characterize and model the processes through which licit and illicit ECM trade flows converge and analyze linked trade, policy, and land use dynamics since 2000 (the what); (2) identify sources of trade irregularities; (3) use remote sensing, human expert analysis, and AI to calculate mining occurring beyond official concessions (the where); (4) use human-in-the-loop machine learning to generate a predictive model of correlations between illicit international trade flows and local land use change, and then use qualitative methods from human geography to conduct a causal mechanism analysis to identify ?the how and the ¬why? of changing illicit ECM trade flows. The project addresses a major gap and will generate actionable science by providing a global assessment of: the credibility of official trade data upon which supply chain analyses are based; the role of illicit commodities in sustaining global ECM flows, including their relative occurrence in specific destination markets, and; the level of illicit mining activity occurring within the mappable extent of mining activities. This project advances scientific theory through a convergence science approach that places social, physical, data and computer sciences on equal footing in order to form a complete picture of illicit ECM flows, and develops a first-of-its-kind multi-modal approach to identify links between illicit ECM trade flows and specific locations of illicit production on a global scale. The methods developed under this project will enable detection of illicitly sourced ECM, will be applicable to other mineral commodity flows, and will provide a strong foundation for continuing research on the complex dynamics of illicit mineral production and trade.

Special attention will be given to supporting students and researchers from underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The project is focused on two major research themes. The first theme is concerned with establishing non-asymptotic higher-order expansions for various distances between probability distributions, with a particular focus on problems and applications in a high-dimensional non-asymptotic setting. The PI will study characteristic properties that are crucial for establishing accurate approximation bounds in high dimensions, such as the normal approximation and bootstrapping and their relations and optimality properties. Another major theme of the project is development of a novel framework for statistical inference based on nonlinear modeling and its applications to nonparametric inference, functional estimation, and inference for models involving heavy-tailed distributions. The approach combines both parametric and nonparametric components, which can avoid severe model misspecification and establish good rates of approximation. The PI aims at conducting a comprehensive study of the new higher-order approximation bounds and the nonlinear modeling approach.

Soil liquefaction remains a leading cause of earthquake damage worldwide. The rarity of earthquakes poses an enduring challenge, geosystems are complex and hard to sample, and the uniqueness of each requires predictive inferences beyond the existing database. Owing to cutting-edge instrumentation and experimentation, new reconnaissance approaches, and generous resources for data storage, the increasing availability of geotechnical data, combined with open-source algorithms, creates an opportunity to exploit the potential of Data Science for reshaping our engineering toolbox.

The standards of practice will also be elevated by formulating efficient test programs that meet economic constraints. Through an organic education plan, this CAREER grant will prepare the geotechnical engineers for the workplace of the future by fostering four core competencies: (i) interdisciplinary thinking to achieve creative solutions in research and practice, (ii) Data Science literacy to harness the power of engineering data, communicate information visually, and deliver reproducible, and transparent products, (iii) diversity to develop geoengineering solutions on a wealth of perspectives and experiences, and (iv) communication skills to engage in teamwork and effective dissemination.

Catalysts are required to promote electrochemical reactions at practical rates. However, the high-cost and low-efficiency of current electrocatalysts has prevented large-scale adoption of electrochemical technologies. While significant advances have been made in designing cheaper alternatives for the oxygen reduction reaction important in fuel cell catalysis, performance has plateaued over the past decade.  The project focuses on a a new class of structurally-modified Metal Organic Framework catalysts (MOFs) that are not constrained by the limitations of current catalysts, thus opening the door to both lower-cost and higher-efficiency fuel cell technology.<br/> <br/>The overall goal of this work is to establish bimetallic porphyrin-based MOFs (PMOFs) as a viable platform for future experimental and theoretical oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) studies.

Taken together these objectives will (1) assess the potential of using PMOFs for ORR and (2) generate fundamental insights related to various ubiquitous phenomena (i.e., solvation, O2 transport and charge transfer) in nanoporous materials. The software infrastructure and theoretical approaches employed will expand the boundaries of atomistic phenomena that can be studied computationally; these methods will be valuable to both the nanoporous materials and heterogeneous catalysis communities.

These methods are particularly advantageous in the presence of uncertainty originating from measurement errors or randomness inherent to the data collection process itself. The principal investigator (PI) will pursue a research program to develop statistical and machine learning methods possessing two important characteristics, robustness and efficiency. Robust algorithms are characterized by their ability to perform well even when some of the data are not accurate and clean but instead are ""outliers,"" such as completely irrelevant or grossly corrupted measurements. Robust techniques can help to reduce the amount of resources spent on human-supervised data cleaning and preprocessing. On the other hand, methods that are efficient are able to extract most of the useful information contained in the data, therefore reducing the amount of uncertainty in the data-guided decision. This research program will be integrated with educational activities that, among other things, will expose undergraduate and graduate students to cutting edge approaches in statistics and machine learning, and give students an opportunity to serve as individual tutors and mentors at local K-12 schools.<br/><br/>One part of the research program is devoted to investigation of the connections between self-normalized sums and robust statistical techniques. In particular, the PI will demonstrate that, unlike many existing approaches, algorithms based on the self-normalized sums often give rise to efficient methods, for instance in the context of univariate and multivariate mean estimation. Analysis of such algorithms is closely related to the theory self-normalized processes. Another part of the research focuses on the asymptotic properties of U-statistics of growing order, and the implications of these properties for robust and efficient empirical risk minimization (ERM), one of the key principles underlying modern mathematical statistics and machine learning algorithms. The PI will introduce a new approach to robust ERM and will relate questions about efficiency of resulting algorithms to purely mathematical questions in the theory of U-statistics. Finally, the research will address uncertainly quantification in robust statistics using Bayesian methods. Specifically, the PI aims to develop new robust analogues of the standard posterior distribution based on U-statistics of growing order, and will investigate the asymptotic behavior of these robust posteriors as well as the asymptotic frequentist properties of the corresponding credible sets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solutions to these problems describe equilibrium configurations of physical systems and provide canonical tools to study the geometry and topology of manifolds.  Physically this can be observed for instance when three soap bubbles merge on a common line forming a corner, or studying the structure of the transition region of an iceberg melting into water.  The goal of this project is to investigate the structure of such singular solutions, which is often the major stumbling block in their application to Geometry, Topology and Physics. Central to the project is an integrated plan of educational activities. This consists in the organization of a REU program and a winter Graduate School <br/>at UCSD on recent trends in Geometric Analysis. The PI will invite experts in the field for five days stays at UCSD to increase the overall activity of the seminar, expose graduate students to the most interesting results and open questions, and encourage collaborations.<br/><br/>This project will focus on two of the most classical and influential Geometric Variational problems: Minimal Surfaces and Free-Boundary problems.  Minimal surfaces provides canonical objects to study the topology of manifolds and are a good model for soap films and partition problems. Free-Boundary problems are fundamental in modeling a wide range of physical phenomena, such as phase transition (e.g. the melting of ice into water), flows with jets and cavities, shape optimization type problems and the pricing of American options.  Solutions to geometric variational problems are known to exhibit singularities.  In the context of Minimal Surfaces, the PI will investigate the regularity of the singular set for Area Minimizing hypersurfaces and for surfaces in any codimension, both in the integer and modulo p cases. For Free-Boundary problems, the focus will be on the structure of the set of so-called branching points for the Two-Phase problem and the Vectorial Alt-Caffarelli problem, and its relation with the set of points of high frequency of solutions to the Signorini problem. This will be achieved refining some new techniques recently introduced by the PI and his collaborators, and by developing new ones, which will have an impact in many other problems in Geometric Analysis.

There is also plenty of information encoded in light in the infrared and in the ultraviolet ranges that cannot be detected by our eyes. For example, many dangerous gases, biomolecules, and air and water contaminants have a light signature in the infrared that cannot be detected by the human eye. The goal of this NSF CAREER project is to create a new generation of compact multispectral photodetectors that can be integrated into portable and personal devices enabling light analysis in the infrared and ultraviolet. This would allow people to use the vast IR and UV information from our environment to detect and respond to phenomena surrounding us. Integrating multispectral photodetectors in mobile phones would enable applications such as checking for food quality or contamination, monitoring air and water quality, and facility disease detection in the skin or bodily fluids. On the educational aspect, this project aims to develop hands-on educational training modules on fabrication of nanoscale devices, facilitating active student learning in nanotechnology training and boosting the training of the next generation of nanoengineers. Developing more hands-on experimental modules with nanomaterials will facilitate active student learning and provide them with experimental/technical skills sought by industry that cannot be achieved in classrooms.

The principle of operation is that by using intercalated graphene monolayers at different depths and integrating materials with different bandgaps, it is possible to achieve broadband photodetection with multispectral analysis capability. This project aims to use CVD graphene monolayers as intercalated photocarrier collectors at different depths in light-absorbing materials for simultaneous detection of multiple spectral bands.

Research suggests that less affluent schools teach less grade-level content, offer significant synchronous instruction, and are more likely to provide paper worksheet packets. Conversely, research demonstrates that more affluent schools use technology for live conferences with teachers, digital delivery of content, and pre-recorded science lessons that can be viewed asynchronously. The project expects that increasing teachers? use of technology can support greater equity between low-poverty and high-poverty schools, particularly during extended periods of remote instruction. The project builds on integrated collaboration with informal science learning organizations, as well as college-based technology training that addresses how we work with, socialize, and educate science teachers. A direct goal of this effort is to prepare highly qualified science teachers who can teach in physical, digital, and hybrid environments that best serve the high-need schools in which they will serve.<br/><br/>This project at Queens College, CUNY, includes partnerships with three high-need local high schools (Bayside High School, Forest Hills High School, and Freeport High School), as well as two informal science learning agencies (the New York Hall of Science and the Black Rock Forest Consortium). The project?s overall goal is to improve the effectiveness of biology, chemistry, geoscience, and physics secondary science educators from culturally diverse communities. To this end, the project seeks to support a total of 30 Scholars across three annual cohorts of undergraduate students and STEM professionals. To support completion of New York State licensing requirements for secondary science teaching, twelve undergraduate Scholars will receive two-year scholarships and eighteen STEM professionals will receive one-year stipends. The project aims to deliver a revised curriculum intended to enhance Scholars' technological content knowledge, science pedagogies, and research experience. It is expected that the project will contribute to a deeper understanding about how integrating formal and informal technology training can support the preparation of highly qualified, culturally diverse teachers who will advance scientific literacy in high-need schools.

Large-scale retrofits are critical in America where more than 44% of existing buildings are expected to be replaced or renovated by 2050. Retrofits of residential buildings have potential to save more energy than commercial buildings. Although the technologies for residential buildings are not complicated, large-scale retrofits are held back due to a lack of understanding human-building interaction and the high complexity of community systems. This knowledge gap results in inaccurate and unnecessary retrofit decisions and causes wasted energy and investment. For example, an energy-efficient stove is not useful if occupants rarely cook. To address this gap, the investigator has created a new concept of routine occupant behavior (ROB) to indicate the stable occupant behaviors that are essential for building retrofit decisions. The research program aims to better understand human-building integration and produce intelligent, cost-effective, and transformative energy retrofit decisions for large-scale residential buildings. Built upon the ROB concept, the PI proposes a highly integrated research and education/outreach plan.<br/><br/>The research outcomes targeted are: (1) definition of ROB via a theoretical framework and a detection tool; (2) optimization of whole-community retrofit decisions via dynamic human-building networks; and (3) enablement of  across-community retrofit knowledge transfer via an intelligent lifelong learning model. Research outcomes are to be validated using data from four testbeds with up to 3,000 single-family and multifamily units across multiple climate zones and geographic landscapes.

A classical question in knot theory asks whether two knots can be obtained from each other by continuously transforming the rope. One way to distinguish two knots is to compute their knot invariants. Some of the most powerful knot invariants include the HOMFLY polynomial and its recent generalization known as Khovanov?Rozansky homology. For instance, the HOMFLY polynomial is used in molecular biology to study how DNA molecules are folded in space. In this project, we relate these knot invariants to objects arising naturally in algebraic combinatorics, a field which applies algebraic methods to study discrete objects such as binomial coefficients or triangulations of a polygon. The number of possible triangulations of a polygon is counted by the famous Catalan number sequence. One of the main results of the project gives a natural geometric interpretation of Catalan numbers, by means of relating them to Khovanov?Rozansky knot homology and the HOMFLY polynomial. The objects that appear along the way are interpreted from the point of view of statistical mechanics, which deals with macroscopic observations of a physical system consisting of a large number of particles. For example, the geometric spaces in question are directly linked to the Ising model at critical temperature, which describes ferromagnetic properties of a flat metal plate at the Curie point. The award also provides funding for the involvement of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs in the PI's research.<br/><br/>The Grassmannian is stratified by spaces known as positroid varieties. In a joint project with Thomas Lam, the Principal Investigator (PI) studies the mixed Hodge structure on the cohomology of positroid varieties. The main result states that the bigraded Poincaré polynomial of the top-dimensional positroid variety is given by the (rational) q,t-Catalan number, introduced in the works of Garsia?Haiman and Loehr?Warrington. The proof proceeds by associating a link to each positroid variety, and relating its cohomology to the Khovanov?Rozansky homology of the associated link. The point count of the positroid variety is therefore given by a coefficient of the HOMFLY polynomial of the link. The PI has recently shown that the point count is given by certain observables in the stochastic six-vertex model. Separately, positroid varieties were connected to the Ising model in the joint work of the PI with Pavlo Pylyavskyy. In this project, the PI uses this relation to give a direct formula for boundary correlations of Baxter's critical Z-invariant Ising model. This formula is applied to questions of universality and conformal invariance of the model, studied by Smirnov et al.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, cryo-CMOS are suitable peripheral circuits candidates for quantum computers (QC) as well as for deep space exploration. However, critical elements of cryo-CMOS device physics remain unclear and their design is still mostly based on analytical equations. Moreover, cryogenic electronics education is not particularly present in most Electrical Engineering programs. The objectives of this project are, therefore, to close the critical knowledge gaps in cryo-CMOS device physics, develop new, efficient and effective models to facilitate cryo-CMOS innovation in Technology Computer-Aided Design (TCAD) that has been the powerhouse of CMOS development for decades, and to educate a diverse cryogenic electronics workforce. Successful implementation will enhance cryogenic experiments at San Jose State University, an underrepresented minority (URM)-serving institution in the California State University (CSU) system and will train students in state-of-the-art cryogenic measurements and simulations. A diverse research team of URM undergraduate students will perform the measurement, TCAD simulations, and code development. A new cryo-CMOS and QC session will be created in the Silicon Valley Women in Engineering (WiE) Conference. Students will co-present the findings at the seminar of the Electron Device Society to the engineers in Silicon Valley. A free summer course to introduce cryo-CMOS and QC will be introduced to socially and economically disadvantaged high school students in the local area, and build a pipeline of future students in quantum computing to create a diverse workforce and become an economic driver for vulnerable communities. The new classes and outreach course evaluation results will be published to share with education communities.<br/><br/>To achieve the goals, 65nm test chips with innovative test structures will be measured down to 4.2K. TCAD and ab initio simulations will be used to verify various cryogenic theories. A new autoencoder framework will be developed for automatic calibration. Additional chip with known fabrication conditions will be used to verify and improve the research results. This work will settle a long-standing controversy in the field, namely the origin of abnormal subthreshold swing (SS), resulting in important breakthroughs and generating new knowledge in cryo-CMOS device physics. An accurate, complete, and practical set of TCAD models will be developed to facilitate the development and optimization of cryo-CMOS for emerging technologies such as quantum computers. The finding of the origin of abnormal SS will lead to new research in interface and band structure engineering, potentially opening up an entirely new research field. Accurate and robust simulation models for mobility and field-dependent ionization will be derived which will facilitate the development of novel cryogenic electronic devices. The proposed complete set of models and robust settings will enable TCAD to accelerate the development of automation tools for high performance and reliable cryogenic integrated circuit designs. The success of this project will pave the path to sub-4.2K modeling of cryo-CMOS for the ultimate co-integration of quantum computers and CMOS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent field studies have shown the presence of emerging contaminants such as microplastics, viruses, and harmful bacteria in groundwater, and fractures are often major pathways through which contaminants migrate long distances at anomalously fast rates. However, conventional groundwater models ignore fracture flow, and as a result, often fail to predict contaminant transport in the subsurface. To secure sustainable water resources, there is urgent need for a new model that predicts flow and transport in fractured media. This project presents an integrated research, education, and outreach plan that will advance the current practices of modeling fractured media and teaching fractured rock hydrogeology. This project will first combine visual laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations to elucidate fundamental physical laws that govern flow and transport at single fracture scales. The identified key single-fracture scale processes will then be incorporated into field-scale models. Finally, the developed models will be validated through field experiments at a fractured aquifer site. The project has three major outreach and teaching activities that are directly synergistic with the proposed research: (i) a professional hydrogeologists? working group will be formed to bridge the gap between academia, industry, and government agencies in the area of fractured rock hydrogeology, (ii) visual groundwater teaching tools will be developed for K-12 and college-level education, and lastly (iii) accessible modules based on a contaminated fractured aquifer site will be developed for a new urban field course.<br/><br/>Conventional groundwater models often treat aquifers as two-dimensional continuous porous media, thereby missing critical complexities that govern flow and transport in fractured aquifers. Recent studies have shown that complex three-dimensional (3D) flows can alter the overall mixing and reaction dynamics up to the field scale, but the underlying processes and how they scale up in fracture networks are still not well understood. This project will establish a mechanistic understanding of 3D flow effects on Transport, Mixing, and Reaction (TMR) at single-fracture scales and translate that knowledge across scales to predict processes at fracture network scales. This project first combines visual laboratory experiments and direct numerical simulations to elucidate how the interplay between fracture heterogeneity (e.g., fracture roughness and aperture variability) and flow boundary conditions (Reynolds number) controls 3D flows and TMR at single fracture scales. The single-fracture scale processes will then be incorporated into fracture network-scale models, and an upscaled modeling framework that predicts TMR will be developed. A comprehensive data set will be generated and analyzed with machine-learning-based methods to yield a powerful map that links upscaled model parameters to key medium properties and flow conditions. The developed upscaled model will be validated through controlled field tracer experiments at a fractured aquifer site. Overall, this project will transform how we understand and model fractured media and will provide a new foundation for modeling coupled biogeochemistry and fluid flow.<br/><br/>This proposal is co-funded by the Hydrologic Sciences and Education and Human Resources programs in the Division of Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But testing misses bugs, so costly and harmful bugs often occur in deployed software. Techniques that can help find more bugs during testing are needed. Runtime verification is one such technique; it finds bugs by checking program runs against formal specifications that describe correct program behavior. This project seeks to make runtime verification more effective and more efficient. The project also aims to facilitate teaching runtime verification to software engineers by creating a course on runtime verification, integrating runtime-verification modules into a software-testing course, and creating publicly available pedagogical materials and open-source tools.<br/><br/>The project focuses on addressing four major impediments to runtime-verification usage: (1) most signaled violations are false alarms, because existing specifications are inadequate; (2) confirming whether a signaled violation is a bug takes too much developer time; (3) runtime verification does not scale to the large software systems on which society increasingly depends; and (4) it is expensive for developers to write tests that cover code where specifications may be violated. Automated solutions to address these impediments will require fundamental advances in operations on traces -- sequences of program events -- that are generated during runtime verification. Consequently, this project will develop a trace-aware runtime-verification technique that works directly on traces. Automated techniques based on trace-aware runtime verification will also be developed to (1) reduce false alarms by repairing existing specifications; (2) classify each violation as a likely bug or false alarm; (3) reduce redundant computations performed during runtime verification; and (4) generate tests automatically to adequately check code with respect to the specifications. The project's main impact is to bring runtime verification closer to helping developers find more bugs during every test run.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, even with the increasing evidence in the importance of SO skills for children, they are rarely included in kindergarten and primary school curriculum. This puts children at a severe learning disadvantage; children who lag behind their peers in school-entry mathematical skills are at high risk to continue to do so. Thus, fostering SO skills before children enter formal schooling provides them with a sound foundation for later mathematical learning. In this project, a team of learning scientists from the Education Development Center and Digital Promise Global, and public media producers from WGBH Educational Foundation, will develop and research a preschool mathematics curriculum supplement. It will leverage digital touch-screen tablets and augmented reality technologies with other hands-on, developmentally appropriate spatial learning activities.  These activities are aimed to increase preschoolers? SO learning and STEM identity, particularly for underrepresented and underserved groups. The project will engage 39 teachers, 50 families, and approximately 585-780 preschool children in SO classroom and family SO learning activities. In addition, the project will generate a new augmented reality tablet app, a digital teachers? guide for preschool classrooms, a digital family guide, and a validated SO assessment for preschool students. Findings from this study will illuminate the potential for this approach on preschoolers? SO learning. The study will also add to the literature on how to design digital activities that foster learning and knowledge that the field can capitalize on for other domains and age groups.  Through this work, the team seeks to broaden the participation of young children, parents, and preschool teachers in robust math and technology learning experiences that increase STEM identities.<br/><br/>The project will use a design-based research approach to develop and test a spatial orientation (SO) intervention. The research questions are focused around 4 areas: 1) Usability and Comprehensibility: What design elements or scaffolds within the learning activities (classroom and home) ensure usability and comprehensibility? 2) Instructional Supports: What instructional activity elements or teacher and caregiver scaffolds are associated with successful engagement in SO activities with preschool children? 3) Potential for Augmented Reality: What aspects of the augmented reality digital activities increase preschoolers? ability to understand SO concepts? 4) Student Learning and STEM Identity: Does engagement in these instructional activities lead preschool children to increase their SO knowledge and STEM identity over time and in comparison to students who do not experience the intervention? And do additional SO learning experiences at home increase preschoolers? SO knowledge and skills? Researchers will collect data from children (assessments, observations), teachers (observations, interviews, and surveys), and advisors (recommendations). Data from teachers? interviews will be analyzed through qualitative data analysis software, and student learning task data will be analyzed quantitatively. Student and classroom observation data, and teacher surveys, will be analyzed with quantitative and qualitative software.

Even the human genome has duplicated segments that result from ancient genome doubling in early vertebrates hundreds of millions of years ago. Although it occurs in animals and fungi, genome doubling is particularly common in plants. Organisms that have undergone genome doubling are often more successful than their non-duplicated parents and have new traits; for example, plants with doubled genomes are often larger than their parents and produce more fruits and seeds. In fact, most agricultural crops and the world?s worst weeds have all originated through this process. As a result, genome doubling is very important both ecologically and economically, yet scientists do not yet understand how the presence of duplicated genes produces new traits. Although the earliest stages of this process are the most critical for understanding the connection between genes and traits, it is precisely these early stages that are the most difficult to study, mainly because nearly all genome doubling events occurred in the very distant past, millions of years ago. In this project, the researchers will investigate these early stages by focusing on two species of plants in the sunflower family that formed in nature via genome doubling in the past 90 years. These species are unique in that their time of origin is so recent; as a result, they are perfect models for learning about how genome doubling generates new traits and how this process can be used to address societal problems related to food security, human health, and climate change. <br/><br/>Whole-genome duplication (WGD, or polyploidy) is a major evolutionary force, yet the critical early stages of polyploid evolution remain poorly understood. This project will promote novel understanding of WGD by providing new insights into recurring polyploid formation and the consequences of genomic merger through analysis of data compiled over the past 30 years for Tragopogon, a genus of plants from the sunflower family that includes two recently (~90 years old) and repeatedly formed natural allotetraploids (T. mirus, T. miscellus) and their diploid parents (T. dubius, T. pratensis, T. porrifolius). New tools, including genetic manipulation via CRISPR-Cas9, will be applied, and new long-read sequence data for both genomes and transcriptomes will be acquired to maximize the value of available data. New analyses to address fundamental questions regarding WGD will focus on: 1) Distribution of natural populations of the polyploids and their diploid parents; 2) Introductions of the diploid parents from Europe to U.S.; 3) Crossability between tetraploids of separate origin; 4) Genetic/genomic consequences of polyploid formation (transcriptomes; reference genomes; proteomes; alternative splicing); 5) Properties of synthetic lines; and 6) Ecological comparisons of polyploids and their diploid parents (greenhouse data; niche modeling). Emphasis will be placed on synthesizing information on the early stages of WGD in Tragopogon and other systems, both natural and synthetic. This broad synthesis will not only provide new insights into WGD, but also set the stage for future investigations by diverse researchers to investigate the patterns, tempo, mechanisms, and forces driving and shaping post-WGD genome evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bacterial cells that are temporarily resistant to high levels of antibiotics are referred to as persisters. Nearly all bacterial cultures contain a small population of persister cells. Persisters are thought to be responsible for recurring chronic infections and drug-resistant mutants. The goal of this project is to identify common mechanisms exhibited by persister cells from a variety of bacterial strains. Anti-persister strategies will developed based on our increased understanding of the underlying mechanisms. Engagement of pre-college students in STEM activities is an emphasis of the outreach activities planned. Teaming is already underway with local elementary and middle schools with >80% underrepresented minority students. A summer workshop is planned, as well as development of short animations.  Articles describing the research results will be submitted to journals targeted at 4th-8th grade students such as Frontiers for Young Minds. <br/><br/>The persistence phenomenon has been documented across multiple microbes and in response to a variety of antibiotics. Persister cell survival is marked by growth inhibition during antibiotic treatment and resumption of growth upon removal of antibiotics. Persisters are generally assumed to be dormant cells with a depressed metabolism. In contrast, hypothesis driving this project is that persisters have active but unique metabolic mechanisms that regulate the reversible switching and maintenance of these cells. An array of assays will be employed to understand how metabolism: (i) is involved in the formation of persister cells and (ii) maintains the survival and resuscitation of persister cells. The results will challenge paradigms regarding persister cell dormancy and metabolism, shed light on persister cell resuscitation mechanisms, provide platforms for studying the metabolic heterogeneity of persister cell subpopulations during and after antibiotic treatment, and integrate multiple lines of evidence to enhance our understanding of the eco-evolutionary aspects of bacterial persistence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, the project will use DT-LCA to address health, economic, and environmental aspects related to drinking water emergency planning and response.  The goal is to enable LCA to address important questions regarding how various human decision factors influence sustainability outcomes, and in turn, how sustainability outcomes influence decision-making. The DT-LCA approach will use an immersive game-based approach to engage stakeholders in simplified but realistic decision scenarios. Unlike the deterministic LCA approach, DT-LCA simulates sustainability outcomes in an iterative, dynamic manner based upon actual decisions made by stakeholders during the game. It combines social experimenting, computer modeling, education, and outreach into one integrated framework.<br/><br/>The research seeks to enhance the way LCA is conducted by tightly coupling it with stakeholder decision- making through serious gaming. Decision factors including risk attitudes, interorganizational networks, and access to LCA results will be introduced into the game?s experimental design to investigate their influences on sustainability outcomes. Stakeholder concept maps before and after game participation will be collected to study the influence of the DT-LCA on learning. These influences will be characterized by analyzing the quantitative and qualitative data obtained from the serious game through statistical and machine learning techniques, network analysis, and text mining. This project aims to generate new knowledge in 1) the influences of human decision factors including risk attitudes and interorganizational networks on sustainability outcomes; 2) the influences of knowledge about sustainability outcomes on decision-making; and, 3) the effectiveness of a tightly coupled decision-assessment framework on stakeholder learning as well as on improving the sustainability of drinking water emergency planning and response practices. This project will also result in the development of 1) a DT-LCA framework that allows for the tight coupling of assessment and decision-making; 2) a novel serious game for engaged learning about drinking water emergency planning and response; 3) a safety planning model and an emergency response model that incorporate various decision scenarios and the associated system responses; 4) a method to integrate impacts related to failure risks into sustainability measures; and, 5) a teaching packet that can be integrated into undergraduate and graduate level courses and be used by self-learners. This project will engage at least 50 stakeholders from New Hampshire along with additional water industry professionals and the general public through workshops and crowdsourcing. A teaching packet will be developed to encompass the game and the simulation tool from this project, and the teaching packet will be integrated into three undergraduate and graduate courses at University of New Hampshire (UNH). This is targeted to help students obtain new knowledge and skillsets that are critical to manage the complexity behind sustainability challenges.

Specifically, this work will study how fibers are made to have the same organization and strength as native collagen fibers.  Collagen fibers are the primary source of strength in tissues throughout the body, particularly in tendons, ligaments, and menisci. However these fibers are not recreated after injury. Engineered tissue replacements do not include these fibers, which makes repair options inadequate. Native collagen fibers are primarily formed postnatally when mechanical cues guide cells to assemble small fibrils into larger fibers and fascicles. These mechanical cues are critical to fiber formation, however their individual contributions are unknown. This work will explore how developmental slow stretch and muscle-inspired cyclic loading drive cells to produce hierarchically organized collagen fibers. Additionally, this research will shed light on the mechanics that govern fiber formation.  A multi-level educational program based in orthopaedics and tissue engineering will be developed as well, aimed at recruiting and retaining underrepresented minorities and women in STEM. Specifically, undergraduates will participate in research opportunities and interdisciplinary courses, middle and high school students will be engaged through hands-on research and National Biomechanics Day programming, and local middle and high school teachers will be trained in inquiry-based curriculum techniques to promote enhanced retention of STEM throughout the central Virginia area. <br/><br/>The specific goal of this research is to explore how developmentally-inspired mechanical loads drive ligament fibroblasts to produce engineered ligament with native organization and strength. The central hypothesize is that tensile strains, which mirror developmental slow elongation and rapid cyclic muscle activity, will individually and synergistically drive native-like hierarchical collagen organization and matrix maturation, in a magnitude- and duration-dependent fashion, resulting in significantly stronger, functional replacements. Using a novel culture system, which supports cellular development of the largest, most organized hierarchical fibers to date, this research will investigate how 1) slow strains (0.1-1 mm/day) that mimic postnatal growth rates, and 2) rapid intermittent cyclic tensile strains (1-2 mm/sec) that mimic muscular activity, individually and 3) in combination drive hierarchical collagen fiber maturation. Specifically, collagen organization at the fibril, fiber, and fascicle level, matrix composition, and tissue mechanical properties will be evaluated with each type of strain. Slow growth elongation and rapid cyclic muscle activity occur at strain rates orders of magnitude apart, most likely producing very different effects on cells. Understanding the different effects of these loads will not only help to engineer functional replacements, but will be integral in developing rehabilitation protocols to restore function after injury.  Future work can use these results to drive regeneration of collagen fibers after injury.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To remain at the forefront of global technology, the US needs a diverse workforce prepared with these skills. There is a tremendous pool of talented learners who are currently not given access to computer science and AI learning opportunities during the critical ages when they develop educational interests and career identities. Experiences during K-12 have a significant impact on those identities and resulting career path choices. This project will engage historically marginalized middle school students in Alachua County, Florida in a summer program that teaches them computer science and AI concepts. Through an authentic inquiry process centered on developing conversational AI, spoken technologies that engage users in conversation, students will investigate and create innovative computational applications. Young learners will have the opportunity to develop skills in the design and implementation of a variety of personally relevant projects including speech assistants, question-answering systems, and games. These projects can offer meaningful engagement that has the potential to transform the way middle school students view computing and AI careers. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers. <br/><br/>In this project, 210 students from diverse, underserved schools with limited access to AI and computer science will engage in two-week summer experiences to learn computer science and conversational AI development. The curriculum design is guided by the theoretical framework of a four-phase process model of interest development from initial situational interest to the eventual well-developed individual interest. Researchers in computer science and educational technology from the University of Florida will investigate the following overarching research question: In what ways can a summer development experience around spoken conversational apps foster middle school students' cognitive outcomes around computing and social-emotional outcomes of interest and identity formation related to STEM careers? The project will use a mixed-method research design to test the hypothesis that students will achieve significant knowledge gain as measured on a pre/post-test for computer science concepts, and that students will show a progression in the use of user-centered design practices as evidenced by source code analysis and mapping both the prototyping and user testing processes they undertake. The project will also test the hypothesis that students will display a significantly increased sense of identity and interest formation toward STEM careers. The research team will analyze patterns of collaboration and participation to explain why the learning experience supports these outcomes. The project will answer important research questions on how to engage middle school students in learning AI and what type of learning outcomes are achievable.

Current studies suggest that many species are now lagging behind changing climatic conditions and are doing poorly relative to past conditions. Determining which species are impacted, how fast species are declining, and evaluating potential solutions to counter declines are key goals. One potential solution is assisted migration, where individuals from a geographically-distant population that are better adapted to the changing conditions are intentionally introduced into a focal population. Assisted migration is controversial because there are often unknown consequences when introducing new variation into a population, and because it has largely been untested via controlled experiments. This award experimentally addresses the consequences of assisted migration in a widespread plant that is threatened in a small portion of its distribution. Seeds and seedlings from populations already adapted to contemporary conditions will be introduced into a subset of focal populations. Comparisons of traits, genomes, and population success between these experimental populations and nearby control populations will provide the best empirical data collected to date on the efficiency and potential utility of assisted migration. This award also addresses the need for greater public understanding of climate change across the U.S. by providing secondary education teachers with the skills, lesson plans, and information necessary to address this issue in the classroom. This award funds the creation of a dynamic game-like climate change outreach module, a graduate student-led science outreach team to go into secondary education classrooms, and a seminar course for aspiring STEM teachers to instruct teachers how to address contentious issues. <br/><br/>The assisted migration experiment awarded here evaluates three main questions: how much introgression occurs across the genome following the introduction and how long does it persist? Does introgression shift trait distributions or enable transgressive phenotypes to emerge? Do introductions improve fitness of the native populations in normal or extreme years? This project addresses these questions by leveraging the genomic resources of a model organism, Mimulus guttatus. Preliminary data indicate that elevation-matched California populations have higher fitness than native Oregon Cascades populations, and that Oregon Cascades populations are in danger of extirpation in extreme climatic years. This project introduces California populations into a subset of twelve populations that have been followed for the last three years. The amount and timing of introgression following introduction will be surveyed by using low coverage whole genome sequencing to track genetic variants specific to the introduced populations over three years post-introduction. A multi-year common garden experiment with seeds collected each year during the experiment will be used to evaluate how phenotypes and fitness changes following assisted migration. While this experiment provides important value to the conservation community, it also will provide novel insights into how evolutionary forces interact within a natural population to remove and maintain polymorphism on rapid ecological timescales.

All naturally occurring DNA double helices twist in the same direction: to the right. These are called D-DNA. Molecular devices made from D-DNA can interact directly with naturally occurring nucleic acids, but such devices are easily recognized and degraded by cellular defenses that recognize naturally occurring D-DNA. A wide range of D-DNA molecular sensors, circuits and actuators have been developed in recent years, but their utility in living cells and organisms is limited by this issue. This CAREER project will enhance the practical utility of DNA-based molecular devices by engineering systems that include mirror-image ?left-handed? DNA (L-DNA). The L-DNA double helix twists in the opposite direction to D-DNA and can therefore resist degradation in the cellular environment. In particular, this project will study the transmission of molecular information between L-DNA and D-DNA in these novel circuit designs, combining experimental and computational research to optimize the behavior of these systems and to demonstrate their use for sensing and control of biological systems. This CAREER project will also strengthen the biotechnology educational pipeline in New Mexico via a collaboration with ¡Explora!, a hands-on science museum in Albuquerque, NM.

They also manage the impacts of frequent severe weather events causing sparks that ignite deadly and devastating fires. The current approach is to react to these problems after they arise because of the lack of  methods that can proactively assess and mitigate risks. This CAREER project will bridge this much-needed gap by developing risk-assessment and optimization methods that will bring transformative change to distribution grid operation by moving from reactive to proactive distribution grid risk management. The intellectual merit of the project lies in developing new risk assessment methods to quantify and mitigate risk due to load variability, wildfire ignitions and electric outages. The broader impacts of the project include improvements in power quality, a reduction in the risk of wildfire ignitions and fewer power outages across the United States. The project will also improve undergraduate power system education through the use of open-source software, and contribute towards increased retention of undergraduate students by developing a learning community that promotes effective teaching practices among teaching assistants.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to develop risk assessment methods to quantify short-term operational risk as well as formulations and solution algorithms for the associated risk-based and stochastic optimization methods. These data-driven techniques will consider multiple imminent threats including multiple scenarios for renewable energy generation and wildfire ignitions, and identify control actions (e.g., setpoints for distributed energy resources and remote switches) that improve security and reliability of distribution grid operations across all these scenarios. Modeling distribution grids requires, e.g., the consideration of three-phase power flow calculations and binary decision variables to ensure radial topologies, thus increasing model complexity relative to transmission grids. Solving this complex, multi-scenario problem will require both new models and solution approaches for data-driven stochastic and risk-based optimization. A main technical focus of the proposal is, therefore, to develop computationally tractable approaches to leverage large amounts of data within an optimization framework, and effectively interface simulations and optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These aquifers are characterized by complex groundwater recharge, storage, and flow patterns in sinkholes, pores, fractures, and conduits. In many mountainous areas of the western U.S. and worldwide that host karst aquifers, most of the annual precipitation falls in the winter as snow. In these snow-dominated karst watersheds, snowmelt recharges aquifers that sustain streamflow in summer when precipitation is scarce and water demand is high. These watersheds are sensitive to year-to-year variations and long-term trends in precipitation and temperature. This creates challenges for sustainable water resource management particularly when a quantitative understanding of mountainous karst watershed response to climate variability is lacking. Such knowledge gaps exist due to complex recharge and discharge processes that occur because of topographical and geological heterogeneities inherent in these watersheds. This project will overcome these limitations and provide a sound scientific basis for improved water resources management. Funding will support both graduate and undergraduate research at multiple universities. Through outreach and educational activities, the project will also engage local stakeholders, the general public, and K-12 students.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of the proposed research is to understand and predict hydrologic responses of snow-dominated mountainous karst aquifers. The three-year project will integrate a spatially distributed, physically based snowmelt model with a data-driven, deep learning model that represents the highly complex karst aquifer system. Field observational and geochemical data sets (including streamflow, and ions and isotopes in stream and spring water) will be collected at various spatial and time scales to identify recharge and discharge characteristics, while also testing the predictive capability and physical representativeness of the deep learning model. Specifically, the project will (1) quantify the spatiotemporal groundwater discharge and streamflow response to snowmelt/rainfall events with varying intensity and duration, (2) determine how interannual climate variability and watershed physical properties influence hydrologic behavior, and (3) test the combined physically based and data-driven modeling approach in different locations and climate conditions. The outcomes will lead to improved understanding of how snow-dominated mountainous karst watersheds respond to climate variability and provide insight into the robustness of the modeling approach for forecasting or transferability to other regions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

BMIs are also powerful research tools for understanding learning in healthy and injured brains. Sleep is known to play a crucial role in learning and memory, and recent work has shown that sleep is a vital factor in learning to interact with a brain-machine interface. This NSF Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project lays the foundation for a research and education program that will discover the links between sleep-associated reorganization in healthy and stroke-injured brains that help in learning a brain-machine interface skill. It will also test whether stimulating certain phases of sleep can boost learning. An improved understanding of the science behind neuroprosthetic skill learning can lead to new insights into how stroke impacts the brain?s sleep-related learning. The results of this work could be used to help design sleep-focused rehabilitation programs and BMI systems for those suffering from stroke. <br/><br/>Brain-machine interfaces offer a powerful technology that merges the computational power of nervous systems with that of artificial electronic systems. BMI learning lends itself to probing sensorimotor plasticity in the brain, and recent work has revealed offline processes in the motor cortex that lead to performance gains while learning a neuroprosthetic motor task. Furthermore, motor cortical stimulation and cerebellar deep nuclei stimulation have both shown promise in promoting motor recovery post-stroke. However, these stimulations have been applied during awake periods. Whether there is any coordinated offline sleep-related processing in these regions and whether such offline activity can be optimized to promote learning of a neuroprosthetic skill remains untested. The research performed under this NSF CAREER project aims to delineate the offline processes in cortico-cerebellar areas of rodents during the learning of a neuroprosthetic task, to understand the neural basis of BMI learning in these regions. The investigators will perform studies in healthy and stroke-injured rats and focus on sleep processing that contributes to learning a BMI skill. The investigators will take a systems-level approach to: (i) characterize the sleep stages and neural processing in cortico-cerebellar ensembles that help in consolidating a neuroprosthetic skill in the intact and the stroke-injured brain; and (ii) test if augmentation of neural processes during sleep in these regions can be used to enhance learning and recovery of a neuroprosthetic skill.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The 2020 Nobel Prize winning CRISPR/Cas technology, which can be used to rapidly detect DNA sequences in any living organism, offers a promising approach.  This approach has been pursued by many companies, but none to date has been able to match the sensitivity of the ?gold standard? test (real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR)), which requires 4-6 hours for completion and costs ~$100 per test.  Thus the goal of this project is to develop a method for SARS-CoV-2 (the virus responsible for COVID-19) detection that is faster, cheaper, more sensitive, and more convenient than the methods presently used for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The project?s goals will be achieved by integrating CRISPR/Cas assays with cutting-edge technologies.  Limitations of existing systems will be addressed using a number of advanced analysis tools, advanced devices, artifical inteligence, and novel nanomaterial probes to design an integrated nanopore-microfluidic device for use in point-of-care (POC) settings that is ASSURED (affordable, sensitive, specific, user-friendly, rapid and robust, equipment-free, and deliverable to end users). Succesful development of this sensor platform will offer a wide range of other uses, as the principles behind it may be applied to other applications that are not related to SARS-CoV-2.  The project creates excellent opportunities for interdisciplinary research, as it combines biochemistry, nanoengineering, photonics, and medicine. Outreach programs related to this exciting project will be offered to K-12 schools, attracting young minds and inspiring them to pursue science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) degrees. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a highly sensitive and reliable nucleic acid sensing tool based on CRISPR/Cas assays for SARS-CoV-2 detection. The research will reveal the cleavage activities of Cas enzymes on a variety of composite nanomaterial reporter designs.  Solid-state nanopores will be optimized for reading the cleavage patterns of nanomaterial reporters in the Cas assays using a deep neural network to classify the cleavage signatures. Solid-state nanopore readout provides single-molecule quantification and also identifies molecular signatures within the translocating molecules, which has significant advantages over the standard readout methods of today (fluorescence, paper-strip, colorimetric, and electrochemical readout). Once the cleavage activities are understood, a variety of reporters whose cleavage patterns correspond to specific target sequences will be designed. Identification of the cleavage products will enable the development of an integrated nanopore-microfluidic device for use in POC settings that will demonstrate simultaneous nanopore and fluorescence readings of cleavage products in multiplexed CRISPR/Cas assays.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many countries were forced to order shelter-in-place or social distance to slow the spread of the disease forcing organizations to rapidly transition to remote work. While the onset of COVID-19 was disruptive, it has provided a worldwide, if involuntary, quasi experiment. The shift in work was unprecedented in terms of scale (forcing many organizations to operate completely remotely) and scope (affecting organizations across the globe). Individuals were forced to adapt to their new work arrangements, which changed how they go about their day-to-day jobs and other life activities and responsibilities. However, even while we come to terms with the ?new normal,? we have the opportunity - and indeed an obligation - to consider what practices and experiences that emerged as part of the ongoing quasi experiment we may want to retain, by virtue of their efficacy, as we transition out of COVID-19. In other words, what can we learn from our experiences in the ?new normal? that will help shape the ?next normal? as we transition out of COVID-19?  To answer this question, this project will use survey and server-side data collected as workers team together using digital technologies at different points through the pandemic. <br/>This project is rooted in a ?teaming affordances? perspective. The sudden shift to all-virtual meetings, and use of digital communication technologies, has heightened workers? awareness of the affordances provided by technologies, for example, to be kept updated on what their colleagues are doing (visibility affordance) or what they know and the nature of their relationships with one another (association affordance). Technology affordances serve as the foundation for teamwork, enabling essential behaviors such as boundary spanning, leading collectively, and motivating. We investigate the extent to which a heightened awareness of the affordances provided by digital collaboration technologies has the ability to nudge workers to engage in teaming behaviors that lead to better team outcomes. Insights from this investigation will make it possible to identify and isolate practices that were triggered by the sudden shift to remote work during COVID-19, but which we must consider retaining as we transition out of COVID-19 and workers have the ability to physically return to the workplace. This project leverages teaming data collected by the project team during and prior to COVID-19, expanding these sources to include a new wave of data collection once in-person work is again possible (?The Next Normal?). Additionally, the project will complement longitudinal field surveys with semi-structured interviews and two waves of a general survey of workers. The project will apply a range of advanced network analytics, including exponential random graph models (ERGMs) and relational event modeling (REM). The interview data will be analyzed using grounded theory methodologies in order to identify practices that help and hinder teaming. This mixed-method longitudinal design makes it possible to explore research questions and test hypotheses about virtual teaming that advance fundamental knowledge on what we can learn from this forced quasi experiment on virtual teaming in a crisis that should inform better teaming practices and outcomes as we transition out of the pandemic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is compiling a historic dataset from deep-sea corals spanning 50 years in the Gulf of Maine to understand how biological material sinking to the bottom has changed with time. Results from the coral analysis are being compared with archival samples of small planktonic crustaceans, copepods, to better understand the connection between productivity in the surface waters and the geochemical record in the coral tissue.

Across animals, communication signals are incredibly diverse and employ a variety of senses, ranging from vision to smell. This project seeks to determine how and why signals differ among species in the charismatic insect group, the fireflies. While the public is most familiar with their flashing signals on warm summer nights, used to find and locate mates, a number of firefly species have lost the ability to produce light as adults. Unlike their lighted counterparts, these ?unlighted? adult fireflies are day-active, and studies suggest that they use smell to detect the chemical signals (pheromones) of potential mates. By comparing North American firefly species that use light versus pheromone signals, there is the potential to identify common patterns in the chemical, genetic, and behavioral changes associated with switching signal modes. The resources produced during this project will dramatically expand genomic tools for fireflies, enabling substantial advances in evolutionary, natural products, and conservation studies. The pheromones identified can open up new possibilities for surveillance of threatened unlighted firefly populations that are otherwise relatively difficult to census. Fireflies also offer an ideal opportunity for public outreach, as they are charismatic insects that draw public interest. Development of educational modules in insect biology and conservation during the Pennsylvania Firefly Festival and interdisciplinary community programming on fireflies in art and culture will bring the science and impact of insects to the public.<br/><br/>In nature, mating signals are diverse and even closely-related species can employ strikingly different signaling strategies. To understand what generates this diversity, we must understand the fundamental mechanisms and evolutionary processes that govern signal mode change across taxa. Fireflies, in the beetle family Lampyridae, are renowned for their nocturnal light signals that function primarily in mate recognition and choice. While the larvae of all firefly species emit light, only some species emit light as adults. These ?unlighted? adult fireflies are diurnal and likely use long- and short-distance pheromones to find mates. In North American taxa, the loss of lighted communication and secondary gain of chemical signals appears to have occurred independently several times. These natural replicates facilitate the exploration of the molecular and behavioral changes that accompany an evolutionary switch in primary mating signal mode. (i) Characterization of volatile and cuticular signaling compounds from pairs of closely related species with contrasting signal modes will test whether chemical repertoires diversify in unlighted taxa. (ii) Next generation sequencing will enable examinations of whether chemical repertoire diversification is accompanied by corresponding diversification of chemosensory receptors, and identify convergent pathways for signal mode switching among firefly clades. (iii) Functional characterization studies will directly link chemosensory receptor genes to specific mating pheromone components. Investigating evolutionary signal mode switches in an organismal system with extreme differences in unimodal signals offers a unique opportunity to develop patterns and predictions that advance the study of more complex multimodal signals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The primary research aim of this project is to investigate the adaptations that regulate the parent-offspring conflict across diverse species. Moss plants are an ideal system to study this conflict since their offspring remain physically attached to and nutritionally dependent on the parental plant throughout their lifespan and the structures involved in the parent-offspring conflict vary across species.

The education components of this work will bring undergraduate students into the field and behind the scenes of natural history collections during an engaging May-term course at the University of Tennessee - Knoxville (UTK), where field collections and specimen-based research will be essential components of the class. Experiences and data from the course will then be used to build educational modules and activities for UTK?s grades 3-12 education programs, on campus natural history collections, and local public botanical gardens.<br/><br/>This research will use an innovative and integrated approach that incorporates comparative analyses of functional morphology, physiology, and evolution using field-collected plants and natural history specimens to understand the processes that have led to diverse adaptations for regulating parental-offspring resource allocation across species.

This project will also generate a robust, globally sampled moss phylogeny in order to reconstruct patterns of morphological evolution and test for correlations between structures influencing the parent-offspring conflict.

These aquifers are characterized by complex groundwater recharge, storage, and flow patterns in sinkholes, pores, fractures, and conduits. In many mountainous areas of the western U.S. and worldwide that host karst aquifers, most of the annual precipitation falls in the winter as snow. In these snow-dominated karst watersheds, snowmelt recharges aquifers that sustain streamflow in summer when precipitation is scarce and water demand is high. These watersheds are sensitive to year-to-year variations and long-term trends in precipitation and temperature. This creates challenges for sustainable water resource management particularly when a quantitative understanding of mountainous karst watershed response to climate variability is lacking. Such knowledge gaps exist due to complex recharge and discharge processes that occur because of topographical and geological heterogeneities inherent in these watersheds. This project will overcome these limitations and provide a sound scientific basis for improved water resources management.

When the direction of ocean waves and the prevailing atmospheric winds are coaligned, counter-rotating roll cells emerge within the ocean layer. These cells ? known as Langmuir turbulence ? manifest on the ocean surface as elongated streaks. It is common practice to assume uniform atmospheric forcing on the ocean surface, when in fact the atmosphere itself is composed of eddying gusts that induce spatial variability in wind stresses. High-fidelity computer simulations will be used to characterize how realistic spatial heterogeneity in atmospheric stress affects evolution of Langmuir turbulence. This project offers opportunities for fundamental research in multiphase, multiscale, large-scale turbulence. The results of this project will be used to promote outreach activities directed to improve diversity and inclusion in graduate-level STEM programs. The investigator will continue to organize an annual one-day fluid dynamics symposium for graduate students throughout Texas and Oklahoma.<br/><br/>Langmuir turbulence in the ocean mixed layer is the product of imposed atmospheric surface drag and the aggregate drift due to wave orbital motion. Langmuir turbulence is a microscale phenomenon that regulates vertical (air-sea) exchanges of momentum, heat, and other quantities. Langmuir cells ? counter-rotating vortices, meandering spatially about a predominant transport direction aligned with the prevailing wind direction ? exhibit lengths of tens to thousands of meters. Langmuir turbulence is generally defined with the turbulent Langmuir number, which is the square root of atmospheric shear velocity divided by Stokes drift magnitude. The imposed atmospheric stress exhibits dramatic spatial and temporal variation about the aggregate value used to compute the turbulent Langmuir number. Such variability is driven by the passage of coherent parcels of momentum in the aloft atmospheric surface layer ? so called large-scale motions, which themselves meander spatially and exhibit lengths up to thousands of meters. High fidelity asynchronously-coupled large-eddy simulations of the atmospheric surface layer-ocean mixed layer will be used to quantify how such large-scale atmosphere motions modulate the spatial and dynamical characteristics of deep ocean (unaffected by bottom-boundary layer) Langmuir turbulence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Across animals, communication signals are incredibly diverse and employ a variety of senses, ranging from vision to smell. This project seeks to determine how and why signals differ among species in the charismatic insect group, the fireflies. While the public is most familiar with their flashing signals on warm summer nights, used to find and locate mates, a number of firefly species have lost the ability to produce light as adults. Unlike their lighted counterparts, these ?unlighted? adult fireflies are day-active, and studies suggest that they use smell to detect the chemical signals (pheromones) of potential mates. By comparing North American firefly species that use light versus pheromone signals, there is the potential to identify common patterns in the chemical, genetic, and behavioral changes associated with switching signal modes. The resources produced during this project will dramatically expand genomic tools for fireflies, enabling substantial advances in evolutionary, natural products, and conservation studies. The pheromones identified can open up new possibilities for surveillance of threatened unlighted firefly populations that are otherwise relatively difficult to census. Fireflies also offer an ideal opportunity for public outreach, as they are charismatic insects that draw public interest. Development of educational modules in insect biology and conservation during the Pennsylvania Firefly Festival and interdisciplinary community programming on fireflies in art and culture will bring the science and impact of insects to the public.<br/><br/>In nature, mating signals are diverse and even closely-related species can employ strikingly different signaling strategies. To understand what generates this diversity, we must understand the fundamental mechanisms and evolutionary processes that govern signal mode change across taxa. Fireflies, in the beetle family Lampyridae, are renowned for their nocturnal light signals that function primarily in mate recognition and choice. While the larvae of all firefly species emit light, only some species emit light as adults. These ?unlighted? adult fireflies are diurnal and likely use long- and short-distance pheromones to find mates. In North American taxa, the loss of lighted communication and secondary gain of chemical signals appears to have occurred independently several times. These natural replicates facilitate the exploration of the molecular and behavioral changes that accompany an evolutionary switch in primary mating signal mode. (i) Characterization of volatile and cuticular signaling compounds from pairs of closely related species with contrasting signal modes will test whether chemical repertoires diversify in unlighted taxa. (ii) Next generation sequencing will enable examinations of whether chemical repertoire diversification is accompanied by corresponding diversification of chemosensory receptors, and identify convergent pathways for signal mode switching among firefly clades. (iii) Functional characterization studies will directly link chemosensory receptor genes to specific mating pheromone components. Investigating evolutionary signal mode switches in an organismal system with extreme differences in unimodal signals offers a unique opportunity to develop patterns and predictions that advance the study of more complex multimodal signals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advanced machine learning methods that leverage massive data to characterize the process-defect relationship have been studied for AM certifications. However, some AM fabrications and certification courses, especially for high-valued metallic parts, are lengthy and costly; thus, if the certification could be transferrable between different AM systems, it may greatly broaden the industrial use of AM technologies. Though feasible in theory, combining data from multiple AM systems on a shared platform for the certification purpose is not practical because of the desire to protect intellectual properties and sensitive data. What is lacking, therefore, is a holistic strategy to share knowledge learned from different AM systems without compromising the private information. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award supports fundamental research on privacy-preserving AM process-defect modeling and certification means across different systems. The project aims to establish a transfer learning groundwork, while protecting the process and part confidentiality, to understand and establish the process-defect relationship in metal AM between different systems. In addition, educational activities closely integrated with the research will provide basic training in privacy-preserving manufacturing systems modeling to next-generation manufacturing engineers from diverse groups, including minorities and women. <br/><br/>Current data-driven AM certification schemes largely focus on characterizing the process-defect relationship of individual systems (i.e., one model for each single system and not generalizable to other systems, even similar ones). Although the state-of-the-art transfer learning methods can leverage data collected from multiple machines for cross-system studies, the research need is to maintain certain confidentiality?for both the part and process?to realize such collaboration. The goal of this project, hence, is to advance the scale-up of metal AM technologies by establishing a data-sharing platform, which enables process-defect modeling among multiple AM systems without divulging critical part and processing data. If successful, the major contribution of the research project will be a privacy-preserving transfer learning framework derived from the following research activities using directed energy deposition AM as an example: 1) constructing masked process features through de-coupling variability components assignable to product designs and process quality using a physics-informed tensor decomposition method, 2) establishing cross-system process-defect relationship through multi-task transfer learning to characterize intra- and inter-system variability and 3) enhancing AM certification capability by integrating part-level density and process-level thermal data based on fundamental physics principles.

CH4 fluxes are determined during summer and winter in eight different US basins to cover a wide area of varying characteristics in gas reservoir depth, structure/tectonics, and climate/ecosystem. A field deployable closed dynamic flux chamber technique is used for these measurements. The relationship between microseepage flux magnitude and a set of hypothesized flux-enhancing parameters is then investigated and used to develop a machine-learning approach for upscaling microseepage fluxes.

With the proliferation of wireless technologies, however, the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum has become increasingly congested. New concepts and technologies, such as artificial intelligence assisted collaborative radio networks, simultaneous-transmission-and-reception-based wireless systems, and large antenna arrays, have emerged to efficiently utilize the spectrum, which necessitate signal processing in the radio frequency (RF) domain. Linear periodically time-variant (LPTV) switched-capacitor circuits have been studied extensively in the past decade as they enable high-quality, widely tunable, and non-reciprocal RF signal processing components on chip. However, existing LPTV circuits are fundamentally limited to low-order, short-delay, and sub-6 GHz operations. This project, by introducing new commutated-inductor-capacitor (commutated-LC) circuits, aims to tackle the fundamental limits of existing switched-capacitor circuits, which has the potential to substantially reduce the cost and size of next-generation wireless systems, thereby benefiting society through increasing access. The PI will develop new courses at the University of Illinois at Urbana Champaign (UIUC) that will integrate the research outcomes of this project. Introductory high-school-level curriculum development in collaboration with established UIUC outreach programs is also planned. The PI established an institute of electrical and electronics engineers (IEEE) Solid-State-Circuits chapter at UIUC and will organize seminars, short courses, and other events in collaboration with other faculty and students.<br/><br/>In this project, the introduction of inductors or magnetic fields to commutated circuits provides new degrees of freedom to existing LPTV switched-capacitor circuits, opening new design spaces at both architecture and component levels.

Specifically, this project will investigate the commutated-LC circuits in the mixing region for reconfigurable filtering front-ends that cover a wider frequency tuning range, operate at a higher RF, and provide steeper filter roll-offs. It will also study the commutated-LC circuits when they are used as delay elements, targeting on breaking the limit of delay-frequency product in existing switched-capacitor delays. Leveraging this new delay component, this project will develop next-generation simultaneous-transmission-and-reception systems and many-element antenna arrays.

The goal of this project is to improve the speed at which material flow analysis (MFA) is performed and to transparently communicate and reduce the uncertainty in the results, thus enabling a routine and updatable process to make MFAs at any scale (from factories to supply chains). The objective is to quantify the uncertainty of MFA parameters and network structures, and to conceive intelligent data collection strategies early in the MFA, thus decreasing the cost for high-confidence MFA results. MFAs are critical tools in the transition towards a circular economy. They reveal opportunities for material efficiency and symbiosis, as well as the system-level impacts of localized changes to the supply chain (e.g., the effect of increased electric vehicle deployment on lithium extraction and manufacturing emissions). Detailed MFA is currently a costly, time-intensive data collection process followed by a typically manual reconciliation of conflicting and missing data. Attendant uncertainties are typically invisible to the end-user.  This research will develop an approach where computational methods are used to reduce data collection costs, improve output data, and better manage uncertainty. <br/><br/>First, Bayesian inference will be used to update uncertainty as new data is collected. This approach will be integrated with the principles of optimal experimental design (OED) to identify the next data records to collect that can lead to the largest uncertainty reduction, measured as the Shannon information gain. Second, the project will study the network structure uncertainty in MFAs by proposing a set of candidate network structures followed by Bayesian model selection to identify the most suitable structure. OED will also be adopted to plan data acquisition that reveals the best network structure. Third, the developed techniques will used to generate MFAs for historical years, and use error propagation to compute in-use stock levels and recycling rates in creating a time-dependent dynamic MFA. These contributions will be accessible through open-source code and demonstrated by studying U.S. steel flows and global polymer flows. The work will result in a guide for eliciting probability distributions for MFA variables from experts, moving the field away from the arbitrary allocation of probability distributions. The costs of improving MFA confidence will be reduced by performing targeted data collection using the principles of OED. Furthermore, network structure uncertainty (i.e., the existence or absence of nodes or flows between two nodes in an MFA) is pervasive and can severely undermine the reliability of the reconciled flow predictions, but has yet to be rigorously studied. This research will investigate network structure uncertainty by forming an ensemble of network structure candidates using both expert advice and randomized network structure generation. OED will also be developed to plan data acquisition that reveals the best MFA network structure while minimizing data collection costs. Through this work, new computational algorithms will be created, for example, an efficient categorical stochastic optimization procedure that incorporates domain knowledge about the MFA network structures, and an information-theoretic OED criterion for model-selection entailing a triple-nested Monte Carlo estimator. This research aims to enable companies, universities, and governments to use an inexpensive but statistically rigorous analysis of physical flows to inform policy, practice, and investment decisions that will increase resource efficiency. Reduced MFA costs and uncertainties will open the door to more powerful forecasting. For example, detailed annual MFAs across time can reveal the dynamics between industries (e.g., steel, aluminum, and cement nexuses) and policies (e.g., tariffs) that are needed for more reliable integrated assessment models. To promote impact, methods and findings will be presented at the Conference of the International Society of Industrial Ecology, produced codes and datasets will be deposited in the Industrial Ecology GitHub repository, and learning tools (e.g., on static and dynamic MFAs) posted to the online learning C-SED website. The project will build a sustained, cross-unit and multi-university Midwest collaboration infrastructure focusing on the topic of data science for sustainability decisions. An outreach program at Ypsilanti STEMM Middle College will integrate key lessons on sustainable materials with FIRST Robotics design principles, helping to empower URM students with the skills to pursue sustainable engineering careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plants frequently encounter environmental stresses, such as drought, heat and flooding, both in their natural environment and in the field in agricultural settings. A major pathway for cell survival during stress is called autophagy, in which damaged cell components are digested and recycled, preventing their toxic accumulation. Substantial information about the autophagy process itself is available, but how autophagy is activated by environmental stress in plants is not yet clear. This research will address this problem by identifying factors that control autophagy and determining their function in stress tolerance. This potentially will lead to new approaches to improve stress tolerance in crop plants, thus enhancing their growth and yield. The project will train a postdoctoral scientist, a graduate student, and undergraduate students in research skills and scientific communication. It will also increase the accessibility of the cell biology scientific literature to undergraduates by annotation of research papers, which can be used in cell biology classes and will be shared broadly online with the scientific community.  The effectiveness of this annotation will be assessed using validated pre- and post-intervention surveys to measure student increases in self-efficacy, competence and motivational beliefs.<br/><br/>The activation of autophagy is a key component of plant responses to environmental stress, and is thought to be regulated via complex pathways that are coordinated with other stress responses to optimize plant growth and survival. Despite this critical role, very few regulatory factors for autophagy have yet been identified and characterized in plants. The goal of this project is to identify previously undescribed pathways for the regulation of autophagy in plants that act both transcriptionally and post-translationally. We will assess the mechanisms by which phosphorylation cascades involving the protein kinase SnRK1 control autophagy under different conditions, and determine the function of a suite of transcription factors that control autophagy gene expression, some of which are potentially regulated by SnRK1. This will be accomplished by genetic approaches to assess function in autophagy and epistasis among factors under different stress conditions, mutation of potential phosphorylation sites, phosphoproteomic analysis, and finally the construction of regulatory networks that integrate both phosphorylation and transcriptional activation events. The regulatory network analysis will in turn allow us to begin addressing how these pathways integrate and cooperate with other stress signaling pathways to enable plant resilience and survival in the face of adverse and changing conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These ""living"" cell masses, named organoids, can serve as a low-cost, rapid, but precise drug-screening platform and, ultimately, replace animal models. Despite the promise, there remains a lack of tools to enable real-time, non-invasive monitoring of the organoids' biological activities. This project supports an integrated research and educational program with goals to (1) develop a three-dimensional flexible sensor deciphering electrophysiological actions of human heart-like organoids and use it to predict the effect of potential anti-viral drugs for COVID-19 on the human heart, and (2) develop a multidisciplinary educational framework associated with the biosensor for multiple levels of students, especially from traditionally underrepresented groups in science and engineering. The proposed research will make a positive and immediate impact on U.S. health and economy by providing a novel organoid-sensor platform useful to determine powerful therapeutics to the on-going COVID-19 and future, unforeseeable outbreak.<br/><br/>For the last decades, extensive efforts have been made to recapitulate the multicellular, anatomical, and functional hallmarks of organs, thereby offering comprehensive frameworks to model organ development, homeostasis, regeneration, and disease. These movements have quickly engineered a variety of organ-like multicellular clusters named organoids. However, there remains a lack of tools enabling label-free, real-time, and non-invasive monitoring of intra-organoid functions. This project aims to establish a set of materials, design layouts, and assembly methods to develop a three-dimensional flexible intra-organoid sensor instrumented with vertically ordered silicon nanoneedles. As a model system, this sensor will be tailored for label-free spatial mapping of electrocardiogram signals from the inside of cardiovascular organoids that are engineered by orchestrating spatially-organized co-differentiation of pluripotent stem cells to cardiac muscle cells and endothelial cells. The quantitative readout of the intra-organoid activities will facilitate improved understanding of the underlying anatomical-electrophysiological-mechanical relationships of cardiac function. Furthermore, this intra-organoid sensor platform will become a transformative organ-on-a-chip tool that will greatly assist efforts to determine the efficacy of newly developed drugs as well as the impact of unidentified toxins. Complementary experimental and computational methods will be established for analyzing time-series data associated with vascularized cardiac muscle functions. This collaborative research has been built upon a strong research tie of the Multiple-PIs in joint efforts over the past 2 years based on a long-standing relationship between Purdue University and the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Because the universities are within close geographic proximity in the Midwest, the investigators at Purdue University will be able to spend significant amounts of time in the clinical setting at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign in order to not only obtain timely feedback from the clinical perspectives but also ensure the progress of the proposed tasks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, the foot?s role in walking efficiency is not well understood, limiting innovation of future assistive devices. This has implications for patients with compromised strength and for the design of ankle-foot assistive devices for walking.  This study aims to reveal the mechanisms that control foot energetics and apply this new understanding to assist walking for individuals with ankle-foot impairments using a novel foot brace. It is anticipated that the knowledge gained from this work will spur a shift in understanding of the foot?s role in walking, which will be applied to the design of next generation foot and ankle-foot assistive devices. As part of this collaborative research project, a broad group of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students will be trained in multidisciplinary research.<br/> <br/>The objective of this research is to reveal critical understandings of the mechanisms governing the energetics of the human foot and apply this understanding to probe and modulate the energetics of the ankle-foot systems using a novel foot orthosis. This objective will be achieved in three parts. First, metatarsophalangeal joint motion will be systematically manipulated through a series of activities and the associated changes in foot power and work will be studied via novel kinetic, multi-segment foot modeling. This will provide critical knowledge of how energy is used and transferred in the healthy ankle-foot system and enhance the ability to interpret measurements used to capture and quantify foot energetics. Next, ankle-foot energy usage and transfer will be probed using a novel deformable foot orthosis with customized forefoot stiffness to gain a deeper understanding of the healthy foot?s energetics as well as its interaction with the ankle joint. Healthy individuals will walk under footwear conditions, representing varying forefoot stiffness levels, while energetic and biomechanical motion analysis data are collected. Finally, as a proof-of-feasibility study, individuals post-stroke will walk under three conditions - barefoot, flexible shoes, and a custom orthosis with tuned forefoot stiffness - while energetic and biomechanical motion capture data are collected. The goal of this final objective is to determine if a deformable foot orthosis with customized forefoot stiffness can be used to enhance the energetics of the ankle-foot system for individuals with impaired ankle-foot energetics. This study will provide critical understanding of the human foot?s energetics and how energy usage and transfer throughout the ankle and foot can be modulated in both healthy and impaired individuals.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Disability and Rehabilitation Engineering program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This University is an open-enrollment, comprehensive regional university in Southern Utah. Over its four-year duration, the project will provide scholarships to 60 full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in biology, mathematics, computer science, chemistry, and mechanical engineering. The Scholars will enter in annual cohorts of about 20 students and receive two years of scholarship support.  Scholars will participate in evidence-based practices known to promote academic success, such as mentoring and a regular study hall.  In addition, Scholars will participate in a series of research and prototyping courses called Innovative Solutions. These courses will span four semesters and immerse Scholars and their peers in a multidisciplinary research project.  This experience is intended to help them learn to collaborate across STEM disciplines, a critical skill for success in many current and future STEM careers. In the Innovative Solutions series, Scholars will learn about research methods, modern prototyping techniques, and technology startup fundamentals, while working in teams to solve modern real-world interdisciplinary challenges.  This project intends to develop a replicable model that other institutions can use to integrate STEM disciplines and team-based learning in ways that promote undergraduate STEM student academic success and career preparation. <br/> <br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. This project?s scope also addresses two common challenges in preparing STEM students for STEM careers: their isolation from other STEM disciplines throughout degree programs and insufficient opportunities for real-world problem solving. To overcome these challenges, the project will establish interdisciplinary cohorts from the biological sciences, chemistry, computer science, engineering, and mathematics. The Innovative Solutions Course Series will engage these cohorts in sequential one-credit courses that emphasize interdisciplinary collaboration, critical thinking, problem solving, and entrepreneurship. Designed as a project-based learning experience, the course series will require participants to research, develop, test, and market a solution to a real-world problem. The topics selected in the courses will be contemporary challenges that enable students to be innovative contributors to the scientific body of knowledge. The project?s research and evaluation efforts will examine how the Innovative Solutions Course series affects Scholars? academic success, communication and collaboration skills, content knowledge, critical thinking, and opinions about science. The Innovative Solutions Course series represents a scalable model for student research and engagement.  Insights gained from its implementation will be disseminated to the undergraduate STEM education community through conference presentations and journal publications. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.

They are popular choices of energy storage technologies, wherever high energy density, high power density and system simplicity are required. However, elusive safety accidents, such as thermal runaways, have become an urgent concern. Failures of LIBs and other high-energy batteries always originate from microscopic heterogeneities, which are difficult to be monitored, analyzed, and predicted by existing methods. Investigations of these heterogeneities at the mesoscale by connecting the single-particle level materials behaviors with the device-level responses, will enable more accurate understanding and more effective management of batteries. The insights and knowledge generated from this study will help to design safer batteries, in which severe early degradation and accidents can be avoided. This project will generate new understanding of electrochemical energy systems that can benefit the education of graduate, undergraduate and K-12 students. As part of the project, a summer program will be established that will target underrepresented high school age students and high school teachers using engineering concepts of equilibrium and dynamics.<br/><br/>This fundamental engineering science research project focuses on the less understood spatiotemporal heterogeneities in battery electrodes, which are hypothesized to be responsible for the large discrepancies between the theoretical and the experimental kinetic parameters that control the electrode processes. The project will utilize operando experiments using visible light and laser Raman microscopes allow the dynamic quantification of heterogeneities among hundreds of particles in realistic electrodes to evaluate the true local current densities via direct derivative image analysis. Physics-based models without presumptions on the rate-limiting step allow consistent determination of the true local kinetic parameters and the rate-limiting step of the electrode processes, which will resolve the long-standing discrepancies and change the prevailing understandings in this field. The deeply integrated experimental and theoretical approaches allow multiple-point calibrations to warrant a reliable framework, which can provide more effective guidance for the holistic design of battery materials and electrodes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project seeks radical, transformative improvements upon the state-of-the-art by identifying and exploiting the mathematical structures that make power system optimization fundamentally distinct from general purpose optimization. While power system optimization is intractable in the worst case, the advantage of a structure-specific technique is that it can preferentially target those more tractable instances that appear in the real world. The intellectual merits of the project include: (i) provable guarantees on a high-quality solution within a fixed amount of computing time; via (ii) low-complexity algorithms that directly and explicitly make use of tree-like graph property of electric grids; and (iii) understanding and exploiting the convex-like behavior in the quadratic nonlinearity between voltage and power.  The broader impacts of the project include: (i) addressing the urgent need for software capable of meeting the safety-critical, large-scale, and time-sensitive needs of power systems; (ii) technology transfer to other societal applications with a large-scale network structure, such as transportation, network statistics, machine learning, and artificial intelligence; and (iii) integration of research and education at the University of Illinois, including outreach efforts to attract and inspire K-12 students and educators. <br/><br/>What makes power system optimization particularly challenging is that it entails making safety-critical decisions on a large-scale system over a short span of time. General-purpose optimization techniques are often too broad and all-encompassing to meet the specific needs of the system. In developing structure-exploiting techniques, this project will focus on two mathematical structures that have shown exceptional promise in the existing and related literature. The first is the tree-like graph structure of the electric grid, which allows many of the hardest combinatorial optimization to be easily solved. Our study will aim to resolve whether power system optimization can be easily solved on a tree-like graph. The second is the quadratic nonlinearity between power and voltage, which exhibits a convex-like behavior despite not being convex. The project will seek to guarantee this convex-like behavior, and to explore its implications for large-scale optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cellular traffic is made up of tiny parcels called vesicles that contain molecules to be sent to their correct destinations.  Movement of traffic allows the cell to perform important tasks, such as responding to the environment, absorbing nutrients, and surviving.  Larger membrane-enclosed structures called endosomes act as a ?parcel distribution center? to decide where the molecules are sent to.  Endosomes are coated with fibers made up of a protein called actin. Similar to muscles and bones in the human body, actin fibers give endosomes proper shape and strength.  Without actin, the endosome collapses, and the traffic stalls. The overall goal of this project is to understand how the cell produces actin fibers to support the structure and function of endosomes.  Results of this project will provide fundamental knowledge about how endosomes form correct structures and direct traffic properly.  In parallel, the PI will integrate multiple new approaches to improve the infrastructure of biochemical education and research, including creating new virtual lab software to help undergraduate students study biochemistry lab courses, establishing a bimonthly campus-wide biological science forum to help graduate students and labs share research and collaborate, and offering strong undergraduate research experiences both in the traditional lab setting and in a new virtual group-discussion format. <br/><br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to understand actin cytoskeletal regulation at endosomal membranes.

Successful completion of the project will fill a large gap in understanding how actin structures are dynamically assembled at endosomal membranes, how actin rearrangements regulate endosomal structure and function, and how the cell may use similar principles to control actin dynamics at other intracellular organelles and trafficking pathways.

However, to allow these technologies to succeed, new hardware components such as more stable frequency synthesizers (FSs) based on novel materials and techniques will be critical and need to be developed.  Similarly, the Internet-of-Things (IoT) has created a growing number of wireless nodes within an already congested spectrum. Therefore, new lower-power tunable front-end architectures that are capable of filtering interference signals and adapting to changing electromagnetic scenarios are needed to grant higher communication throughputs and longer battery lifetimes. To meet these challenges, this CAREER proposes to develop a new class of passive, tunable, and high-performance integrated resonant devices, namely the Piezoelectric Resonant Acoustic Metamaterials (pRAMs). Thanks to their unique, artificially produced and reconfigurable modal features, the development of pRAMs will enable new stable FSs, adaptive front ends for IoT radios and many other on-chip transducers for sensing and communication.

The project achievements will enrich both the undergraduate and the graduate courses that the Principal Investigator teaches on circuit theory and on advanced acoustic-based technologies for communication and sensing. <br/><br/>The pRAMs will rely on the distinctive propagation features of acoustic metamaterials, built out of CMOS-compatible Aluminum Nitride (AlN) or Aluminum Scandium Nitride (AlScN) thin-films and embodying a periodic arrangement of magnetostrictive rods. Thanks to their unique, artificially produced and reconfigurable modal characteristics, pRAMs will surpass the material limitations that have prevented the achievement of low-loss acoustic resonant technologies, even with moderate frequency tuning ranges. This will allow the creation of new on-chip acoustic-based passives and will provide the means to achieve significantly more stable FSs for future networking components.  Furthermore, pRAMs will allow the development of a new class of tunable channel-select-filters enabling future generations of IoT wireless nodes resilient to interference and consuming lower power. It is envisioned that by exploiting their new magnetosensitive behavior responsible for their large tuning range, pRAMs will likely pave the way towards a new class of chip-scale magnetometers, achieving the low limits of detection compatible to the challenging needs of critical biomagnetic and environmental applications, yet not requiring to be biased or cooled.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While in some areas, such as cryptography, not much can be done without randomness, in other areas such as algorithm design, it is not clear if there is a fundamental reason that randomness should be useful. Further, in applications where randomness is crucially important, it is often the case that one needs access to purely random bits but natural sources of randomness are typically defective. Thus, while many applications heavily rely on randomized techniques, there are many important questions related to the power and requirement of randomness, as well producing high quality randomness that we still do not understand.  The major research agenda of this project is to further our understanding on these broad directions (which are central questions in the area of pseudo-randomness) using exciting recent progress. The project also features activities designed to increase the fraction of undergraduates from disadvantaged backgrounds choosing computer science as a major.<br/><br/>The main research goals of this project can be broadly classified into the following two directions:  (i) Unconditional de-randomization: A central question in complexity theory is if randomness is necessary in efficient computation. There are longstanding conjectures and conditional results that indicate that one can derandomize efficient computation (i.e., remove the use of randomness without paying much in efficiency). A central goal of this project is to push the state-of-art in several important directions that include (unconditionally) derandomizing algorithms that use limited memory, and various sorts of circuit families that have been beyond reach so far.  The investigator plans to tackle these problems by leveraging multiple new approaches that have surfaced recently such as exploiting Fourier analytic structure, and new frameworks of de-randomization based on recent notions such as fractional pseudorandom generators, and pseudorandom pseudo-distributions. (ii) Extracting pure random bits from defective sources of randomness: Complementary to the above direction, the area of randomness extraction focuses on producing purely random bits from low quality sources that occur in nature. There has been remarkable recent progress in this area, and the important research goals of this project include constructing better extractors in realistic models of defective random sources and in the presence of adversaries, with applications to cryptography, and investigating the use of such extractors in unconditional de-randomization pursuits listed above.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While these electrical components are direct-current (DC) in nature, they still need to interface with the legacy alternating-current (AC) power line in our home and building, leading to inefficiencies in power delivery (10%-30% loss in total power consumption), space utilization, and added 10%-15% overall system cost for many AC-DC adapters. In addition, AC distribution at 110-220 volts in commercial buildings and households also poses a safety concern especially for children as AC wall outlets and cords are responsible for 15% and 63% of injuries, respectively, in children aged 12 years and younger. The goal of this integrated research and education career development is to facilitate faster developments and increase adoption of DC micro-/nano-grids for more efficient DC distribution in residential and commercial use in a More-DC world, by realizing a next-generation integrated hybrid DC-DC power converter family with demonstrations for multiple important applications. The converters are designed to achieve superior efficiencies, smaller sizes, and lower system cost that can reduce the number and impact of inefficient AC-DC conversions. The research program, positioned at the boundary of integrated circuits and power electronics, aims at fundamental advancements in converter technologies, integrated circuit designs, integrated packaging, and system integration for DC power management and delivery, applicable in billions of home and office devices. The research outcomes can be applied and create positive impacts in improving efficiency and density of power management and delivery in many applications, including mobile battery chargers, mobile computing, data centers, DChomes/DC-buildings, automotive vehicles, motor drive, and LED lightings. A significant part of the research program is to integrate fundamental research with education in the area of integrated power electronics and energy efficiency through training and involvement of US San Diego graduate and undergraduate students, specific outreach modules that will engage and attract K-12 students and the general public to this important STEM area, and teaching activities that integrate research topics and findings in the curriculum. <br/> <br/>To achieve the research goal, the objectives of this CAREER proposal are to: (1) investigate and implement scalable integrated converters with high input voltage and large conversion ratio based on a novel single-inductor multi-synchronous stage (SIMS) DC-DC converter architecture that can efficiently provide large conversion ratios from high input voltages in order to minimize the number and impact of AC-DC conversions, (2) study and design integrated packaging procedures using integrated silicon capacitors <br/>to fundamentally reduce distribution loss and improve the system efficiency and power density, (3) generalize the median-average analysis (MAA) methodology, and use it to provide more accurate, intuitive model and control of hybrid DC-DC converters in order to bridge key knowledge gaps in understanding core operations and control of hybrid converters, (4) demonstrate and evaluate the feasibility of a DC nano-grid using a single AC/DC converter to supply multiple DC loads through the integrated converter prototypes developed in this project, and (5) demonstrate the integrated power delivery systems in a number of example applications, including battery charger, mobile and highperformance computing, and DC-home/DC-building power distribution.

Modern industries rely on computational problems ranging from statistical analysis of massive amounts of data to optimization problems that improve their ongoing operations. As such, general-purpose frameworks for designing fast and reliable algorithms are very valuable. Linear and convex programming is one such framework, studied since the 1830s by mathematicians, and since the 1940s as a tool for solving computational problems. Modern applications of convex programming can be found everywhere; for example, power companies optimize their pricing and sourcing of electricity, and companies like Uber and Amazon optimize their logistics, using convex programming. More recently, convexity has played an important role in statistical and probabilistic analysis; there is an increasing amount of interest in these problems due to their intimate connection with and uses in machine learning. While convexity and convex programming have had many successes, they are only suited for continuous problems, leaving a large gap to address discrete phenomena. Discrete phenomena can be found everywhere: statistical models of diseases and symptoms in medicine, categorical predictions in machine-learning models, and value-optimization problems involving bundling of items in retail industries. The goal of this project is to develop a foundational framework for fast and reliable statistical-analysis and optimization algorithms based on discrete notions of convexity for discrete problems. This project incorporates a synergistic education plan that includes curriculum development for undergraduate and graduate students at Stanford university aimed at students from a diverse set of areas: computer science, statistics, mathematics, and operations research.<br/><br/>This project will develop a discrete convexity framework for algorithm design through three fronts. First, the project will study combinatorics of convex polytopes encapsulating discrete objects and relate them to algorithmic efficiency. The project will explore generalization of matroids, objects widely used in combinatorial optimization because of their theoretical guarantees in greedy algorithms. The expected outcome will be an understanding of when local search, an optimization technique that operates by changing small parts of the solution at a time, succeeds. Second, the project will explore randomized algorithms such as Markov Chain Monte Carlo and Gibbs Sampling on discrete objects, producing an understanding of when local algorithms are successful in sampling from discrete distributions and in statistical analysis. One goal of this project is connecting the effectiveness of local search for optimization problems and local algorithms for sampling from probability distributions. Finally, the project will explore variational techniques for statistical analysis, a category of convex-programming-based algorithms that are typically much faster than Markov Chain Monte Carlo, but sometimes come with worse theoretical guarantees; however, variational techniques are widely used with success in practice, and this project will aim at shedding light on their effectiveness through the lens of discrete convexity.

Climate strongly influences erosion, in part because it determines where glaciers can form and, subsequently, erode the landscape. The overarching aim is to understand how climate changes and glaciers influences mountain development, specifically through erosion. The investigators will focus on a part of the central Andes that provides a natural laboratory for such investigation. The researchers will use a model to estimate past temperature and precipitation ranges based on their observations, which will also improve understanding of former natural climate variability and how it may influence the growth of mountains. The researchers will integrate a range of interdisciplinary expertise at different institutions to accomplish the goals, including scientists in the U.S. and Argentina. The project fosters early and middle-career development for at least a postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student. The researchers will carry out outreach, such as, by engaging with K-12 science teachers, in a museum science-themed exhibit, and at their institution's open house. <br/><br/>Climatic and tectonic forces interact with one another in the growth of mountains, particularly through their shared influence on erosion patterns. Yet, distinguishing the influence or signature of one force from another can be difficult. The researchers propose to explore glacier and climatic imprints on the development of landscapes in an environment where such effects appear to be eminently discernible, in the arid Andes. Neighboring catchments experienced a range of glacial geomorphic conditions, from extensively glaciated to marginally glaciated to not glaciated. The study focuses on two overarching hypotheses: (1) In the arid Andes, the last Ice Age brought the coldest conditions, but not necessarily the largest glaciers and precipitation impacts to landscape processes. The researchers will (i) date glacial deposits of unknown age, which will constrain when climate changes occurred, and (ii) carry out glacier-climate modeling, which will improve their understanding of, for example, the magnitude of past temperature and precipitation changes; (2) Ice Age climates impact landscape development directly through glacial erosion and indirectly through fluvial network change. The researchers will assess potential patterns of glacially-modulated erosion using detrital 10-Be measurements (short timescale) and low-temperature thermochronology (longer timescales), and geomorphic metrics that are known to record tectonic and climatic perturbations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over a five-year duration, this project will provide scholarships to 40 full-time students who are pursuing associate degrees in chemistry or biochemistry. These Scholars will be recruited in four annual cohorts of 10 students and receive up to two years of scholarship support. The project aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, while generating knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.

There are four specific aims: to increase student success in chemistry/biochemistry through curricular and co-curricular adaptations; to enable students to complete the chemistry/biochemistry pathway, earning their Associate of Science for Transfer degree within two years and transferring into a baccalaureate degree program; to develop science identity, STEM self-efficacy, and career awareness of students, including those from diverse, underrepresented backgrounds; and to contribute to the body of knowledge about effective techniques and evidence-based practices that improve the recruitment, retention, and success of academically talented, low-income STEM students. Research shows that transfer students who are engaged with their institution are more successful and that developing students' identity as scientists improves both their engagement and retention. The overarching research question of this project is to explore how Scholars? participation in project activities enhances their development of science identity, science self-efficacy, community cultural wealth, and transfer capital. This work has the potential to advance understanding about how combining financial support with academic supports and social integration at the community college and university levels affects student graduation and transfer.

During the daytime, when the sun warms the surface and air rises and becomes turbulent, meteorologists refer to this layer as the convective boundary layer (CBL).  The height above the ground of the top of the CBL is variable and has relevance to thunderstorm initiation, precipitation, and pollutant concentration.  However, there is no simple way to provide continuous measurements of the height of the CBL over large areas.  This project will further investigate a method to retrieve the CBL top height by using the operational National Weather Service radar network.  These weather radars are sensitive enough to detect gradients in different airmasses, such as the more humid convective boundary layer and the drier air above that.  The significance of the work is through the development of a dataset that can be used to assess the ability of numerical models to simulate the convective boundary layer, and therefore practical weather phenomena.  The project also has a significant education and outreach component, with training for multiple graduate students, creation of features for a public television program, and implementation of a Research Experience for Teachers program.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to improve understanding of the evolution of the convective boundary layer top height (CBLH) using the clear-air remote sensing capabilities of the operational WSR-88D radar network.

This technique would provide a significant increase in observations of CBLH due to the rapid updates and nationwide footprint of the WSR-88D network.  Five main activities are:  1) Develop monthly mean values of observed hourly daytime CBLH from at least 50 radars across the US over two distinct years (2014 and 2022) to explore similarities and differences in CBLH evolution, 2) Develop monthly mean values of predicted hourly daytime CBLH from the operational Rapid Refresh (RAP) model, 3) Calculate the difference between the radar observed CBLH and the RAP predicted CBLH, and explore reasons for the differences using all available observations, 4) Explore the ability of the differential reflectivity observations to estimate entrainment zone depth by comparing them to new rawinsonde observations, and 5) Study the late afternoon inversion layer separation and CBL descent using the observations and modeling derived above.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While recent works have looked into the fairness issues in AI concerning the ?short-term? measures, the long-term consequences and impacts of automated decision making remain unclear. The understanding of the long-term impact of a fair decision provides guidelines to policy-makers when deploying an algorithmic model in a dynamic environment and is critical to its trustworthiness and adoption.

The timing of at least some of these extinctions often coincides with human arrival into newly colonized areas. While extinctions since the last ice age have occurred worldwide, the islands that make up the Caribbean have been perhaps the single hardest hit region. This island system, rich in well-preserved paleontological and archaeological sites, has preserved a spectacular record of both past bird diversity and human occupation. Still, our knowledge of the patterns, causes, and consequences of long-term changes to Caribbean bird communities remains surprisingly limited. This knowledge gap hampers our understanding of past diversity changes and its causes, and thus our ability to manage and conserve remaining diversity into the future. This research focuses on closing these knowledge gaps using DNA from fossils (ancient DNA) to understand taxonomic affinities of extinct species, and radiocarbon dating to determine the last occurrence of a species. This approach provides critical information to determine who these species were, and to time their losses in relation to climate change and waves of human arrivals to the islands. This project also focuses on the characteristics of species that have made them more vulnerable to extinction (for example, flightlessness) as a means to more completely understand the causes of extinction in the past and forecast the extinction risk for existing species. This project has broad societal impact through its educational and outreach components. The project will provide training for underrepresented students in science, focusing on extinction and ancient DNA, and develop classroom content for K-12 classes in Florida in partnership with the University of Florida Thomson Earth Science Institute?s (TESI) Scientist in Every Florida School (SEFS) program. And to further public understanding of science, and to bolster conservation efforts for threatened Caribbean birds, the researchers will develop a documentary video in both English and Spanish and work with museum-based outreach efforts to inform wide audiences across the Caribbean islands.<br/><br/>It is estimated that 12% of the bird species in the Caribbean either went extinct or were extirpated since the late Pleistocene, with many more now considered to be endangered or threatened. Less well understood is the role humans have played in these extinctions and population losses. Because human arrival to these islands occurred much later than on the mainland, archeological and paleontological evidence can be used to determine how humans interacted with the local fauna upon their arrival to domesticate, translocate, and cause the extinction of some species. Evidence of this lost avian diversity is fragmentary, often represented by only a few specimens with limited morphological characters. This causes challenges for proper phylogenetic placement, especially given potential for convergence due to shared life histories such as flightlessness. In this project researchers will build phylogenetic trees of clades of birds including modern, extinct and extirpated taxa to determine the phylogenetic and trait affinities of these species. This work will also elucidate biogeographic patterns of the full endemic fauna of the Caribbean, that has been obscured due to extinctions of enigmatic taxa, and build a picture of the level of biodiversity loss in terms of phylogenetic and trait diversity. A key next step is to then integrate new phylogenetic knowledge into a larger context of overall avian diversity patterns to explicitly quantify past loss of phylogenetic diversity across the Caribbean. We will generate a new metric, diversity loss risk, that integrates insight from phylogenetics, traits, and past extinction events to reveal which extant species are of greatest concern for preventing permanent phylogenetic diversity loss.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet surprisingly, we know less about some aspects of these important waters than we do the more distant waters of the deep ocean. This project will use state-of-the-art spectrophotometric methods (that is, light- and color-based methods) to advance our understanding of the fundamental and ever-changing chemistry of these waters and, eventually, the effects of these changes on marine life. The focus of this study will be to understand the chemistry of carbon dioxide in seawater. The new tools we will use are recently characterized pH indicators ? chemicals that change color in seawater depending on the acidity of that water. These specially selected, purified indicators can be used to measure pH with unsurpassed precision and accuracy. We will use the indicators in laboratory experiments to determine how a critical parameter of the carbon dioxide system (a dissociation constant known as ?K2?) changes depending on the temperature and salinity of the water. Characterizing K2 has been a goal of marine chemists for more than 50 years. The better we know K2, the better we can understand and predict how carbon moves through and cycles within natural waters. These measurements will expand our understanding of not only K2 but also the many other seawater characteristics that can be calculated from K2. Ultimately, this work will facilitate the interpretation and prediction of many ocean processes relevant to human health and coastal economies, such as ocean acidification (the lowering of ocean pH due to increasing carbon dioxide in the atmosphere) and calcium carbonate dissolution (the resulting dissolution of seashell material). The results will thus lay the groundwork for new perspectives on how ocean acidification affects the various shelled organisms that serve as food for economically important marine animals/fisheries and for people. The results of this work will also help to improve models of carbon dioxide dynamics in lakes, rivers, underground pore waters, and physiological fluids.  As regards broader impacts, this work will help the PI continue to transfer his knowledge on this important topic to the next generation via his training of graduate, undergraduate, and high school students.  This project would support one graduate and one undergraduate student, as well as help the current research projects of two minority doctoral students.  Lastly, the PI plans to continue his involvement in the Bridge to the Doctoral Program aimed at getting minority students involved in the sciences.<br/><br/>In seawater, two carbonic acid dissociation constants (K1 and K2) describe the relationship between solution pH and the relative concentrations of dissolved carbonate ions, bicarbonate ions, and dissolved carbon dioxide. Accurate characterization of these CO2-system constants over broad ranges of environmental conditions has been a much sought-after goal for more than 50 years because knowledge of these terms is essential for quantitatively interpreting and predicting the biogeochemical cycling of carbon in all natural aqueous systems. The accuracy of CO2-system calculations is especially sensitive to uncertainties in K2, the equilibrium constant that describes the dissociation of bicarbonate ions to produce hydrogen ions and carbonate ions. This research project is designed to use spectrophotometric pH measurements (solely) to characterize this important constant. The purified pH indicators to be used in this work provide seawater pH measurements of unsurpassed precision and accuracy. Using select indicators whose properties have recently been characterized over freshwater-to-seawater ranges of salinity and temperature, we will determine K2 over similar ranges so as to improve the accuracy of CO2-system calculations in estuaries and coastal ocean waters. The resulting insight into equilibrium characteristics will facilitate interpretations and predictions of pH buffering in aqueous systems, provide an improved understanding of calcium carbonate solubility behavior, and lead to improved models of CO2-system behavior in freshwater lakes, rivers, soil and sediment pore waters, and physiological fluids. The longer-term benefits of this project will extend to assessments of the influence of ocean acidification on the life cycles of carbonate-bearing organisms that serve as food for economically important marine organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will transform existing distribution grid modeling and monitoring that relies on costly sensors to a scalable and robust method using widely-deployed smart meters. The intellectual merits of the project include developing new optimization and probabilistic graph learning methods to enable data-driven real-time network modeling, rapid detection of large-scale outages, and robust distribution system state estimation. The broader impacts of the project include integrating power engineering education with data science through training professional workforce for data challenges, developing open-source datasets, and providing outreach to high-school students for interactive learning of smart grids. If successful, this project will provide U.S. utilities with better situational awareness at minimum sensor investment cost, thus saving millions of dollars, while promoting seamless integration of renewable energy, and enhancing grid resilience.<br/><br/>The increasing deployment of smart meters extends monitoring capability to grid edges and provides unprecedented amounts of data. However, most utilities use smart meters for billing purposes only, without exploring insights or gaining actionable information from them because these data are limited to low-resolution and unsynchronized measurements. The proposed project will open a new venue to enable utilities to extract useful intelligence from smart meters through three major technical innovations: (1) Real-time topology identification, where the approach is to design a Laplacian-like matrix that can capture the physical network feature and leverage its inherent sparse structure to discover nodal connectivity even from low-quality measurements. For online parameter identification, a novel bottom-up optimization algorithm using only smart meter data is proposed. (2) A new graph learning approach that takes advantages of intrinsic conditional independencies among smart meters and other outage information sources to serve as a data fusion framework for fast, scalable, and accurate outage detection. (3) A multi-objective robust data recovery technique  to minimize smart meter asynchrony error. A hierarchical reinforcement learning-aided method is proposed to overcome the scalability issue, and to enable joint primary-secondary distribution system state estimation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Model simulations can produce realistic North Pacific storms even if the sea surface temperatures (SSTs) are held fixed, indicating that the storms owe their existence to the strong upper-level jet stream and accompanying north-south atmopsheric temperature contrast rather than air-sea interactions.  Nevertheless there are intriguing hints that storm behavior can be influenced by variations in the underlying SSTs, and some indications that slowly varying SSTs may change storm paths and behavior in ways that could prove useful for making long-range weather predictions. The SST variations of interest occur as a result of the meandering of the Kuroshio-Oyashio Extension (KOE), a narrow ocean current that extends into the Pacific from the coast of Japan. The KOE is a warm current and the sharp temperature contrast between the current and the cold water north of it produces relatively strong SST variations when the KOE shifts to the north or south.<br/><br/>Attempts to identify and analyze the influence of KOE-related SST variations on storms and atmospheric circulation have had mixed results.  But recent work by the Principal Investigators (PIs) and others suggests that the key to capturing the atmospheric response is to dramatically increase the resolution of atmospheric models used for this purpose. In particular the PIs have developed a variable resolution version of the Community Atmosphere Model version 6 (VR-CAM6) which takes advantage of the spectral element dynamical core to increase resolution over the North Pacific (a box from 20N to 60N and 130E to 110W). The lower resolution outside the North Pacific allows the model to be run cheaply enough to allow large ensembles of simulations, with 60 or more separate simulations for each imposed SST anomaly pattern, so that even weak atmospheric responses can be captured and analyzed.<br/><br/>A further asset in identifying the atmospheric response to KOE-related SST variations is a simplified ocean model which allows the near-surface ocean to respond to changes in surface winds and other atmospheric forcing.  The model is referred to as a ""pencil"" ocean model, or PenOM, because it represents the up and down transfer of heat in a column of the ocean below each grid box of the surface atmosphere.  PenOM does not simulate the lateral movement of water in ocean currents, but work under this award adds the capability to represent changes in SST due to Ekman transport, meaning the sideways drift caused by the Coriolis force acting on water pushed along by the surface wind.<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest due to its relevance to long-term weather prediction as noted above.  Also, the PenOM configuration with Ekman transport will be made available to the worldwide research community through the Community Earth System Model as part of its suite of simpler model configurations. The work promotes international collaboration in atmospheric research through its collaboration with Dr. Arnaud Czaja at Imperial College London, through the arrangement noted below.  Also, the project supports several outreach activities including the production of a short educational video featuring model simulations and research results.  The project also provides support and training to a postdoctoral research associate.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the National Science Foundation?s Directorate of Geosciences (NSF/GEO) and the National  Environment Research Council (NERC) of the United Kingdom (UK) via the NSF/GEO-NERC Lead Agency Agreement.

Recent shifts in petroleum resources have placed pressure on the BD market, opening the door to on-purpose production of BD.  A particularly promising technology is the Lebedev process which manufactures BD from ethanol.  However, the process relies on a complex, multicomponent catalyst and suffers from low product yields.  The project will develop a molecular-level picture of the reaction network used to produce BD from ethanol, which in turn is important for developing new catalysts that can achieve high BD yields.  Thus, the project has potential to ensure security and U.S. competitiveness in BD production while supporting the clean-energy transition to biorenewable feedstocks. Additionally, the investigator will develop new course materials to teach undergraduate students about catalytic reactor design and biobased chemicals production.  The project team will also develop a module to educate high school students and the public about the production of renewable chemicals from woody biomass.<br/><br/>Following on the early work of Union Carbide, many groups have used MgO-SiO2 as a low-cost platform from which to develop next-generation catalysts for the Lebedev process.  However, to date a rigorous reaction kinetics analysis of BD production by MgO-SiO2 has not been performed.  Based on recently published results from the investigator?s team, coupled with observations in the literature, the rate of BD formation over pure MgO-SiO2 catalysts is hypothesized to be controlled by ethanol dehydrogenation, while selectivity to BD in the presence of transition metal promoters is hypothesized to result from C-C bond formation catalyzed by acid-base site pairs.  The literature is conflicted about the C-C coupling mechanism and the nature of the requisite active sites, which the study will clarify in three main thrusts.  First, steady-state reaction kinetics measurements using model MgO-SiO2 catalysts containing specific types of acid-base site pairs will be used to identify rate-controlling steps and to clarify which sites are responsible for the kinetically significant reactions in BD production.  Next, these catalysts will be spectroscopically characterized by FTIR, XPS, LEIS, and SSNMR to identify site requirements and abundant surface intermediates.  Finally, a microkinetic model will be used to unify the macroscopic kinetics observations with mechanistic insight provided by kinetic isotope effect and isotope tracer studies and DFT calculations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As such, the research team will be able to optimize over the architecture and parameters of full sensing and processing stacks, resulting in fundamentally novel cameras tailored to specific imaging and perception tasks. These new cameras learn to shift complexity between optics, compute, illumination, sensing, and the scene light transport, exploiting the scene and scene semantics as part of the imaging process.

Specific aims include: (1) To implement a four-year program of evidence-based, integrated academic, professional, and personal experiences; (2) to contribute to an understanding of the impact of student cohorts and other psychological and social factors on student success and retention and graduation in STEM; and (3) to broaden the participation of low-income high-achieving STEM students in Biology, Earth and Space Sciences, Chemistry, Mathematics, and Physics.   Drawing on a phenomenological approach, the mixed methods research and development effort will examine the lived experience of Scholar cohorts to document and explore how growth mindset, desirable difficulties/productive struggles, and metacognitive practices during learning impact student success, retention, and graduation with a STEM degree.  Across individuals, time, and methods/measures, the project?s triangulation strategies will support the development/collection of data, the use of multiple data sources and methods/measures,  analyses of the data to include addressing convergence, inconsistency, and contradiction, and the establishment of the trustworthiness, credibility, and validity of the study findings.  The project has the potential to advance knowledge about activities and factors that differentially influence student success, retention, and graduation in STEM.  A mixed methods formative and summative evaluation will inform project improvement, as well as document and assess project processes and student outcomes.  Results from the project will be made available through the project website, publications, and presentations at education-oriented conferences and venues.  This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

MSC's have the unique ability to change into a variety of different cells, and they can support our immune system by releasing cell signaling molecules depending on the body?s needs. Due to these benefits, biomanufacturing of MSCs has emerged as a vital area of research. However, obtaining cells that exhibit specific functions is difficult because MSCs typically exist as a mixture of cell types. In this project, microfluidic technology is proposed to select cells based on key electrical parameters that have been associated with MSCs that promote healing. This project includes efforts to increase the number of African American undergraduate and high school students pursuing STEM fields.<br/><br/>MSC cultures contain stem cells, partially differentiated progenitor cells, and fully differentiated cells. MSC therapeutic potential is limited by the inability to select specific cell subpopulations. Little is known about the defining characteristics and functional capabilities of all MSC progenitor subtypes within a cell population. This project has 3 goals. The first is to use a label- free cell sorting technique, dielectrophoresis, to target MSC progenitors based on their functionality. The second is to expand the number of biomarkers that can be used to reliably identify MSC progenitors.  The third is to pinpoint the key structural and molecular contributions to cell polarization. This project will attempt to expand the number of independent biomarkers that can be used for cell selection with dielectrophoresis based membrane capacitance and cytoplasm conductivity. The successful completion of these investigations will yield new molecular insights into cell surface molecules regulating differentiation, the release of cell signaling molecules, and gene expression in the mesenchymal lineage. Additionally, we will have an effective dielectrophoresis-based microfluidic device for stem cell sorting to advance biomanufacturing efforts for better cell therapies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

All components of the FishNet 2 cyberinfrastructure will be updated. The number of institutional data providers to FishNet 2 will be greatly expanded. The process of harvesting data from providers and processing the harvested data will be automated to keep the data up to date. We will also offer a variety of support services for FishNet 2 data providers. A dynamic, relational database design will be implemented with the flexibility to add data fields not currently reported to FishNet 2 users.  A number of new search and results-reporting features will also be implemented. Lastly, new services will be added, including data quality assessment tools, a FishNet 2-specific R package (statistical computing and graphics software), a web forum for communicating with users and data providers, a FishNet 2 hosted data publishing (IPT) service and a new and improved FishNet2 Application Programming Interface (API).<br/><br/>Notices on all project activities and all project products will be broadly disseminated to FishNet 2 data providers, software developers and members of the biodiversity informatics community through web forums, conference presentations, scholarly publications, and posts to the GitHub source code management service.

This proposal aims to understand the genetic basis of one such intragenomic parasite. Intragenomic parasites are associated with general biological processes such as the creation of new species and the chromosomal makeup of the genome as well as human health issues like infertility. Recently, researchers have worked to adopt genomic parasites to control pest populations such as mosquitoes. Thus, understanding the genetic basis of these parasites may inform a) our understanding of basic biological processes, b) issues related to infertility, and c) applications of intragenomic parasites for biocontrol measures. Part of the project will involve providing research opportunities to recent transfer students in an attempt to improve retention and satisfaction of this historically vulnerable population.<br/><br/>This project specifically examines sex-ratio meiotic drive, a phenomenon where males carrying a specific gene or mutation on the X chromosome produce female-biased sex ratios because the paternal X chromosome is somehow able to interfere with the development of Y-bearing sperm. The approach is to use gene expression, cytology and genomic techniques followed by genome editing to develop and test hypotheses about the genes involved in sex-ratio meiotic drive. The second part of the project will dissect the genetic basis of Y-linked resistance to sex-ratio meiotic drive using similar techniques. The third goal of the proposal is to understand how these intragenomic parasites might cause natural selection to actually favor improper segregation of chromosomes during meiosis leading to gametes missing sex chromosomes.

However, producing industrially applicable powder alloy precursors is challenging. Although pre-mixing pure metal powders have allowed a wide range of compositions by conventional sintering, rapid heating and cooling in modern sintering techniques inevitably results in new but unwanted chemical gradients, as well as microstructural and property anisotropy. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will investigate a high-power impulse magnetron sputtering process as an advanced technology to modify the surface of metallic powders. The deposition of thin films on the powders forming core/shell systems can provide solutions to make different alloys with more homogeneous and controlled microstructures when used as powder feedstock. This new class of powders will enable a reliable supply of raw materials for cost-effective sintering of reproducible components in the aerospace, automotive, energy, and healthcare industries. The integrated educational and outreach activities of this project will broadly concentrate on: 1) educating and training women and underrepresented minorities as the future generation of highly-skilled leaders in advanced manufacturing, 2) establishing a pipeline of diverse undergraduate students to pursue graduate studies in collaboration with James Madison University in Virginia through special summer programs, and 3) implementing an online set of virtual laboratories in advanced materials characterization of core/shell structures as well as materials processing. <br/><br/>The overall research objective of this project is to establish the scientific underpinnings for the surface modification of micro- and nano-powders into core/shell systems that promote three-phase transformations in sintering-based processes. The core/shell of various combinations (e.g., aluminum-copper, titanium-copper, copper-chromium and nickel-chromium, etc.) will be the eutectic compositions for modeling because of their industrial relevance, an ability to form precipitation hardening alloys, and excellent high-temperature properties. It is hypothesized that high-power impulse magnetron sputtering combined with the vibrational motions of powder holders can achieve conformal thin films on powders, which are desired to produce favorable microstructures. To test the hypothesis, the project will study sputtering discharges to understand the nucleation and growth mechanism of thin films on complex geometries such as spherical powders when including vibrations. This research also aims to understand the role of powder-film interface in the two-phase core/shell diffusion couple and its effect on the final part microstructure from sintering. The combined strategy of the project will lead to a new method of manufacturing core/shell materials suitable for modern sintering processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many are trapped by the Earth?s magnetic field in a region called radiation belt, which extends from an altitude of about 640 to 58,000 km.  These trapped high energy particles can come down to the upper atmosphere at polar region (a process called particle precipitation), interacting with atmospheric molecules to create the colorful aurora.  Some very high energy particles can come further down, depositing energy into the atmosphere and altering the chemistry, and affecting global energy balance and circulation.  The effects of these high energy particles are not well understood because of lack of measurements of the particles lost from the radiation belt into the atmosphere.<br/><br/>This CAREER project outlines an integrated research and education initiative to quantify particle losses from the radiation belts and their effects in the upper atmosphere, using an affordable, large-scale imaging technique. Radiation belt precipitation forms a critical link between the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and atmosphere.  The Principal Investigator (PI)'s research goal is to quantify the flux, spectra, spatial and temporal scales of energetic particle precipitation (EPP) events, their chemical effects in the upper atmosphere, and their effects on radiation belt populations. In pursuit of these research goals, the PI will: i) establish a low-cost, autonomous very-low-frequency observation network across Canada to observe variations due to EPP in the mid- to high-latitude D-region ionosphere; ii) refine and improve our understanding of EPP signatures and processes and their relationship to radiation belt losses using an ensemble Kalman Filter-based inversion technique; and iii) validate results using operational spacecraft data.  <br/><br/>The PI's education goal is to build a robust undergraduate and graduate education and training program in space physics and engineering at CU Boulder by: i) advising PhD and undergraduate students while maintaining the PI's track record for recruiting and supporting female and underrepresented students; ii) incorporating research outcomes into the graduate space physics curriculum through a new upper-level graduate course; iii) providing research experience opportunities to high school students; and iv) promoting broader understanding of space physics in the non-technical community through a new campus-wide undergraduate course on the space environment and its effects and a new textbook covering this course material.<br/><br/>Quantifying precipitating fluxes will also lead to improved Space Weather nowcasting and forecasting and has implications for spacecraft design and operations in the radiation belts; orbital dynamics and drag in Low Earth Orbit; and radiation safety for high-altitude aircraft.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The chemical break down of carbonic acid represents a critical step in the process of ocean acidification. Additionally, the solubility of the mineral calcite is essential for the stability and dissolution of minerals affected by ocean acidification. This is important because carbonate minerals like calcite will dissolve as the oceans become more acidic, therefore, this has significant implications for organisms that build carbonate shells. This project will provide fundamental insight into carbonic acid dissociation and calcite mineral solubility - phenomena of wide interest to researchers within and beyond the field of chemical oceanography. It will address an important gap in data availability and understanding of major seawater chemical interactions within the carbonic acid system. Such information is needed to provide the public, scientific leaders, and policymakers with a better understanding of the consequences of unabated carbon emissions for ocean chemistry and marine ecosystems in the open ocean, estuaries, coral reefs, and more. The project integrates research and educational activities on ocean acidification and climate change by introducing this information directly into secondary school, college curricula, and scientific journals. The project fosters education for undergraduate and graduate students from the ethnically diverse population at the University of Hawaii, while conducting cutting-edge research at the same time. In addition to supporting, educating, and mentoring graduate students, two undergraduate students from the Global Environmental Science program at the University of Hawaii will be supported each year. The project will work with a local TV broadcast to produce a TV episode on ocean acidification. The investigators will also coordinate various public educational activities and outreach events at institutions and in collaboration with local schools, educational centers, and Museums in Honolulu. The project results on ocean chemistry and climate will capture the attention of oceanographers, a broad scientific audience, and the general public alike.<br/><br/>The dissociation of carbonic acid and calcite precipitation in ionic media such as seawater are ubiquitous phenomena in the marine environment and are critical to numerous processes in solutions ranging from brackish waters to brines and to applications from ocean acidification to carbon sequestration. Carbonic acid dissociation and calcite solubility in dilute solutions, simple NaCl media, and seawater at constant major ion ratios (including Na, Mg, Ca, K, Cl, SO4) is relatively well understood and the stoichiometric dissociation constants/solubility products are well known. However, there is a significant gap in the fundamental understanding of the thermodynamics of carbonic acid dissociation and calcite solubility in non-standard seawater solutions, particularly for complex solutions and varying concentrations of Mg, Ca, K, and SO4. Accurate thermodynamic data for such solutions are presently missing. Yet, the data is critical for numerous modern marine systems, including marginal seas and estuaries, sediment porewaters, certain anoxic basins/hydrothermal environments, sea ice brines, cell compartments in marine organisms, etc. Moreover, the ocean's major ion composition has varied substantially in the past. This project will accurately measure carbonic acid dissociation in seawater solutions of non-standard major ion compositions, determine calcite solubility for the same solution composition, and derive and implement critical parameters for chemical speciation models (ion-pairing models, Pitzer models, etc.) based on the measurements. Acid-base titrations under controlled laboratory conditions will be conducted to determine the first and second stoichiometric dissociation constant (K*'s) of carbonic acid in aqueous solutions of varying ionic strength, temperature, and composition (Mg, Ca, K, and SO4), as well as measurements of calcite solubility for the same solution composition. From the data, parameters to improve existing chemical speciation models will be extracted, allowing computation of K*'s and calcite solubility over a wide range of compositions. The implications and applications of the project results are very broad and relevant to chemical oceanography, marine biology, geochemistry, paleoceanography, physical chemistry, medicine, and more.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The timing of at least some of these extinctions often coincides with human arrival into newly colonized areas. While extinctions since the last ice age have occurred worldwide, the islands that make up the Caribbean have been perhaps the single hardest hit region. This island system, rich in well-preserved paleontological and archaeological sites, has preserved a spectacular record of both past bird diversity and human occupation. Still, our knowledge of the patterns, causes, and consequences of long-term changes to Caribbean bird communities remains surprisingly limited. This knowledge gap hampers our understanding of past diversity changes and its causes, and thus our ability to manage and conserve remaining diversity into the future. This research focuses on closing these knowledge gaps using DNA from fossils (ancient DNA) to understand taxonomic affinities of extinct species, and radiocarbon dating to determine the last occurrence of a species. This approach provides critical information to determine who these species were, and to time their losses in relation to climate change and waves of human arrivals to the islands. This project also focuses on the characteristics of species that have made them more vulnerable to extinction (for example, flightlessness) as a means to more completely understand the causes of extinction in the past and forecast the extinction risk for existing species. This project has broad societal impact through its educational and outreach components. The project will provide training for underrepresented students in science, focusing on extinction and ancient DNA, and develop classroom content for K-12 classes in Florida in partnership with the University of Florida Thomson Earth Science Institute?s (TESI) Scientist in Every Florida School (SEFS) program. And to further public understanding of science, and to bolster conservation efforts for threatened Caribbean birds, the researchers will develop a documentary video in both English and Spanish and work with museum-based outreach efforts to inform wide audiences across the Caribbean islands.<br/><br/>It is estimated that 12% of the bird species in the Caribbean either went extinct or were extirpated since the late Pleistocene, with many more now considered to be endangered or threatened. Less well understood is the role humans have played in these extinctions and population losses. Because human arrival to these islands occurred much later than on the mainland, archeological and paleontological evidence can be used to determine how humans interacted with the local fauna upon their arrival to domesticate, translocate, and cause the extinction of some species. Evidence of this lost avian diversity is fragmentary, often represented by only a few specimens with limited morphological characters. This causes challenges for proper phylogenetic placement, especially given potential for convergence due to shared life histories such as flightlessness. In this project researchers will build phylogenetic trees of clades of birds including modern, extinct and extirpated taxa to determine the phylogenetic and trait affinities of these species. This work will also elucidate biogeographic patterns of the full endemic fauna of the Caribbean, that has been obscured due to extinctions of enigmatic taxa, and build a picture of the level of biodiversity loss in terms of phylogenetic and trait diversity. A key next step is to then integrate new phylogenetic knowledge into a larger context of overall avian diversity patterns to explicitly quantify past loss of phylogenetic diversity across the Caribbean. We will generate a new metric, diversity loss risk, that integrates insight from phylogenetics, traits, and past extinction events to reveal which extant species are of greatest concern for preventing permanent phylogenetic diversity loss.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The areal extent of sea ice is decreasing and the ice is getting thinner. Observing and understanding this ice loss is critical to predict future ice conditions and develop plans to respond to these changes. This project uses autonomous buoys to determine the mass balance of sea ice. The sea ice mass balance is a simple concept. It is how much the ice grows in winter and how much it melts in summer; specifically, how much it melts on the surface of the ice and how much on the bottom of the ice. This separation enables the relative contributions of the atmosphere and the ocean to be determined. These buoys will be deployed at key locations in partnership with other instruments measuring conditions in the atmosphere and ocean. Buoy deployment locations are influenced by modeling studies and by logistical opportunities. The ice mass balance data will be used to gain insights into the drivers of the current rapid sea ice decline and changes in the characteristics of the upper layers of the Arctic Ocean and to improve models of sea ice and climate.<br/><br/>Seasonal ice mass balance buoys are based on a spar-type hull design. They are designed to be installed in the ice and to float stably upright in open water. The sensor package on the buoy provides time series data on position, barometric pressure, vertical profiles of air-snow-ice-upper ocean temperature, snow depth, ice thickness, ice growth, surface melt, bottom melt, and ocean heat flux. This project will procure and deploy a minimum of eight buoys per year; process and archive the data from these buoys to be fully, freely, and immediately accessible to all users; implement new sensors into the buoy production process and make this ever-improving technology available; and continue to post mass balance results on a publicly accessible website. The ice mass balance buoys will also be the centerpiece of a middle school science program called ?Adopt-a-buoy.? By working with an observation site at the school, where they collect data similar to measurements by buoys installed in the Arctic, eighth-grade students will gain firsthand experience formulating hypotheses, accessing, processing and analyzing data, and presenting results to their peers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dissolved organic matter provides food and energy for microbes living in the ocean and influences microbial diversity. Microbes convert some dissolved organic matter to CO2 (respiration) whereas other forms of dissolved organic matter are altered by microbial processes and persist in the ocean. Thus, it is  important to understand how microbes change dissolved organic matter composition and reactivity. This project will examine the chemical structure of dissolved organic matter to identify: 1) molecules that fulfill carbon demand (biomass produced minus losses from respiration) and 2) transformation processes that result from microbial activity. The project will combine lab experiments and field studies at the Moorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research site. The project will support training for three graduate students in marine biogeochemistry. Undergraduate training is aimed at sustained mentoring of underrepresented minority (URM) students. Undergraduates will be recruited from existing programs at Minority Serving Institutions at San Diego State University and the University of Hawai?i at M?noa. Undergraduates will participate in the Scripps Institution of Oceanography SURF Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, where they will conduct research in marine chemistry. The goal is to provide a mentoring approach that can successfully overcome roadblocks to URM engagement in STEM and increase retention of these students in marine science.<br/><br/>This work will combine field and lab studies using advanced molecular-level chemical characterization tools to explore how bacteria alter the composition and bioreactivity of organic compounds dissolved in seawater. Additionally, this project will develop informatics-based tools to identify a larger proportion of chemical structures in marine dissolved organic matter (DOM) than is currently possible using traditional approaches. The project will use tandem mass spectrometry and networking techniques to comprehensively classify organic compounds into molecular families and determine common chemical transformations. Then, using a well-developed field-based experimental ecosystem to produce diverse labile DOM pools the research team will track microbial transformation using expression of hydrolytic enzymes and measure selection for particular microbial taxa and metabolisms. This approach defines the reactivity of individual molecules and broader compound classes participating in carbon fluxes that underpin DOM-microbe interactions. Field surveys conducted within the Moorea Coral Reef Long Term Ecological Research program will explore methods to track transformation of specific molecules in the environment and validate experimental observations of compound classes that appear to accumulate as semi-labile DOM. By integrating laboratory and field experiments and oceanographic surveys with the refinement of analytical tools for untargeted metabolomics, this project will characterize the fate of reactive DOM in the ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The system will consist of wearable sensors, tactile actuators, and a robotic device that promotes two-way physical collaboration between the mentor and trainee. The project's three aims are: (1) to develop methods to transform trainee kinematic and kinetic information into meaningful feedback to the expert mentor; (2) to optimize haptic guidance cues about proper tool manipulation technique from the expert to the novice trainee; and (3) to assess the effectiveness of the collaborative training system through human-user studies. The project will promote the progress of science and advance the national health by accelerating the development and use of collaborative robotic systems in healthcare settings, The tele-mentoring aspect of this project may also enhance the national defense by developing systems that can train life-saving skills in remote environments where expert surgeons may not be available. The project also supports education and broadens participation in engineering through support for elective courses promoting biomedical innovation and healthcare technology development and through workshops focused on medical simulation and education.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a customizable haptic co-robot that enables a remote expert surgeon to coach a remote trainee to achieve expert-like performance in complex emergency medical tasks that depend critically on the sense of touch. The project has three aims.  The first develops hardware and software methods to transform real-time trainee kinematic and kinetic performance data into intuitive haptic cues for the mentor. The second develops analogous haptic cues for the trainee based on guidance from the expert about proper tool use kinematics and kinetics.  The third uses human-user studies to assess the collaborative training robot ability to enhance the learning and retention of three intraoperative surgical skills (needle insertion, chest tube placement, and suturing). If successful, this project will lay the groundwork for more effective and ubiquitous co-robotic training of complex manual skills.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to monitor body dynamics and to provide real-time feedback is instrumental in fitness training and injury prevention. Motivated by the lack of fitness training models that understand the key factors related to human motion in the cyber realm, this project aims to leverage the cyber-physical components of fitness monitoring to track and encourage proper movement during strength training. The proposed framework distills body dynamics into form and performance measures that can assist application developers with the design of novel fitness and movement-based applications. This project will create knowledge that can be ported across the fitness, therapy and rehabilitation domains and will have a broad impact in the health community. For example, the findings of this project can potentially help devise a training regimen for breast cancer and other post-surgery rehabilitation patients.<br/><br/>This project includes three key thrusts that aim to bring the advancements in cyber-physical systems to the realm of fitness monitoring. First, exploring and understanding fundamental metrics in biomechanics, which form the foundational tools to measure longitudinal performance changes. Second, developing stochastic models to faithfully capture the dependencies of various attributes during physical motion for analyzing user progress. Third, designing a feedback system that engages the user, leading them to improved form and performance. The core contribution of this research is in monitoring and creating models to understand factors pertaining to users' motion that affect their progress over time. Access to real-time feedback on fine-grained motion will transform the way people perform targeted physical movements, reducing their injury risks and enhancing users' experiences in any fitness environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
