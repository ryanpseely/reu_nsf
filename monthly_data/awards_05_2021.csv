Alex Kandel of the University of Notre Dame is exploring how molecules self-assemble as clusters and as monolayers on surfaces.  A combined experimental and theoretical approach is devised where experiments probe self-assembly of molecules and the data obtained is used to tune the theoretical calculations to ultimately obtain realistic models for how molecules self-assemble and provide insight on the role of intermolecular interactions in the process.  A special focus of the project is on amino acids, which are the basic building blocks of proteins, because it is the interactions between amino acids is what determine the structure and thus the function of these essential biological molecules.  While the interactions of individual amino acids are simple, extended amino acid systems such as proteins rapidly become challenging with increasing size.  The project seeks to improve theoretical models of amino acids, advancing our understanding of these fundamental molecules, while at the same time improving computer simulations of a wide range of biological processes. In the course of conducting the project, graduate, undergraduate and high-school students will be trained in advanced scientific research methods.  Instrument development for this project places an emphasis on rapid prototyping and three-dimensional printing, in order to make reproduction of scientific tools inexpensive and simple, and thus accessible even for those in the community without access to extensive scientific infrastructure, including undergraduate institutions and high schools. Plans and instructions for assembly for all instruments will be published freely online. Also a publicly available website containing the entire scientific output of the laboratory has been organized using a browsable and searchable database.<br/><br/>The research activities of this project explore molecular self-assembly into clusters and monolayers on surfaces.  The emphasis is on non-equilibrium self-assembly, where multiple metastable structures form as the result of kinetic controls.  This is in contrast to typical self-assembly experiments, which generally seek to prepare the system in a single, thermodynamically stable state.  The goal is to use the multiple metastable structures produced to draw inferences about a larger region of the intermolecular potential energy surface than is ordinarily probed by experiments. Because of this, the research affords the possibility of refining and improving polarizable force fields to be used in large-scale simulations of strongly interacting molecules.  On the experimental side, clusters and monolayers on surfaces will be studied in ultra-high-vacuum and at low temperature  using scanning tunneling microscopy. As a complementary technique, electrospray ionization mass spectrometry will be employed to study gas-phase cluster ions, as past results have shown that there is often coincidence between preferential formation of a particular cluster size in the gas phase and the observation of that cluster size on the surface.  Experiments will probe self-assembly of amino acids and related molecules, and will proceed hand-in-hand with theoretical calculations in an effort to obtain a better model of intermolecular interactions in these systems.  Ab initio calculations will initially be used to obtain parameters for molecules of interest for the AMOEBA force field, and comparison of experimentally observed structures to those arising from simulations should allow parameters to be adjusted to better capture the effect of intermolecular interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, corals are vulnerable to increasing water temperatures, which can lead to coral death. One way for reefs to survive in warming oceans is for corals that are well-suited to warmer waters to repopulate reefs that have less temperature-tolerant individuals. For this strategy to succeed, however, the more temperature-tolerant corals need to be able to disperse to and survive in these different environments. This project takes advantage of reef systems in the Pacific nation of Palau that naturally experience a wide range in temperatures across short geographic distances. Using cutting-edge ecological and genomic techniques, the team of investigators is directly testing whether young corals from Palau?s warmest reefs can successfully be carried by ocean currents to Palau?s currently cooler reefs and subsequently survive and thrive in these habitats. Given the relevance of this research for the local ecology, the team is disseminating results to the Palauan government through a written report in conjunction with Palauan scientists who are interning with the team, and to the Palauan people through public presentations. As part of this work, the investigators are maintaining a blog and are organizing a music-lecture series combining dance, music, and science to promote awareness of the coral reef crisis across English and Spanish-speaking communities in the US. Results from this project are informing restoration and conservation practices of the Coral Conservation Consortium as well as other efforts worldwide.<br/><br/>A major question in evolutionary biology is how plasticity and adaptation interact to influence survival under novel environments. Understanding these processes is increasingly important as rising temperatures associated with climate change influence species globally. For marine organisms with pelagic larval phases, including reef-building corals, the post-settlement period constitutes a critical bottleneck for adaptation and plasticity, with the added complexity that the conditions experienced and time spent as larvae can incur carryover effects. This project leverages reefs in Palau that span a steep environmental gradient to study how environmental variation drives selection and plasticity and to examine if dispersal between reefs limits success across habitats due to carryover effects. The investigators are testing the overarching hypothesis that corals from warmer and more variable environments are adapted to warmer temperatures and exhibit increased plasticity, but that dispersal between reefs incurs a fitness cost. The team integrates field and molecular techniques to: 1) investigate the degree of selection occurring on warmer and more variable reefs, 2) test whether corals transplanted to more variable environments improve their thermal tolerance through developmental plasticity, and 3) examine whether delays in metamorphosis required for dispersal across reefs comes at a fitness cost due to carryover effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Located in Guangzhou, China, GGH is one of the biggest hospitals in China, and the GCI affiliated with it is constantly ranked top three in terms of cardiovascular disease research. The project will select three (3) graduate students and three (3) undergraduate students nation-wide each year and support them to visit GCI over a period of twelve (12) weeks to work with world-renowned researchers on cardiovascular medicine in an immersive setting, addressing some of the most critical and challenging problems through innovative AI algorithms that can benefit the large population suffering from CHD.<br/><br/>CHD is the leading cause of mortality from birth defects, which occurs 1 in every 110 births in the United States, and even more in developing countries. CHD comes with very large structure variations which makes it time-consuming and tedious to diagnose manually. In addition, the most common treatment for CHD is cardiac surgery, which is rather complex and is widely regarded as the jewel in the crown of surgery. Currently, only radiologists and surgeons with extensive experience in CHD can handle them confidently. The outcome of this project will potentially boost the effectiveness and efficiency of CHD treatments, and benefit the large population worldwide who suffer from CHD. The project will also enable U.S. students to conduct high-quality research on AI for CHD, in collaboration with their research mentors at GCI. Such experiences expose them to the international research community at a critical early stage in their careers. It is expected that through participating in this program, U.S. students will gain extensive experience on the research of deep learning with medical applications, on the international healthcare prospects, on Chinese culture, and on performing and collaborating in an international environment in general. The experience will also be shared to the broader community through personal social media as well as outreach events such as KidAI webinars for national K-12 students interested in AI. To ensure sustainability, the project will provide professional development support for the participating students. It will also focus on minorities and underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The scientific objective of this IRES project is to explore innovative AI algorithms that can benefit the diagnosis, treatment planning and prognosis of CHDs. The proposed research, through the collaboration<br/>between doctors at GCI and the IRES visiting students in the engineering fields, targets fundamental<br/>issues in medical image processing and diagnosis of CHD that need to be addressed urgently. Although AI has shown great potential in general medicine, the large heart structure and great vessel connection variations in CHDs cannot be handled well by existing AI algorithms developed for other diseases. The proposed research will be the first to tackle this challenge and innovative algorithms are expected to be developed. It can also be anticipated that with the close interaction with leading research group on cardiovascular diseases in China, the breakthroughs made from these projects at GCI can have a direct impact on AI-based medicine research, clinic usage, and social welfare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

RNA performs many critical functions in cells, including performing protein synthesis in ribosomes. Ribosomes are synthesized in the cell nucleolus, a subcomponent within the nucleus of cells. Ribosome synthesis is a crucial function in cells, and inhibitors of ribosome synthesis cause cell death by a process known as nucleolar stress. Dr. DeRose will study how nucleolar processes are inhibited by small metal platinum compounds that can cause nucleolar stress, using biochemistry, chemical synthesis, and cell biology methods. This study will help establish principles of how metal complexes interact in the nucleolus, and which properties determine whether metal complexes are inhibitors of nucleolar function. The study will also aid in understanding how different steps of ribosome biosynthesis can be influenced by small molecules. The project is anticipated to develop a new set of small molecules that can be used by other researchers seeking to study the nucleolus. The project will support students from groups currently underrepresented in STEM, and will create a strong interdisciplinary training environment for workforce development, by combining synthetic chemistry, RNA biology, bioinformatics, and molecular and cell biology.<br/>   <br/>Ribosome biogenesis is a highly conserved process required for all domains of life, and its disruption leads to cell death. Factors governing nucleolar architecture, which is dynamic through the cell cycle, are not well-understood. Existing methods to inhibit nucleolar processes include broad ?stress? inducers such as reactive oxygen species or heat shock, which are not specific to nucleolar stress. The mechanisms of the few existing small-molecule inhibitors of ribosome biogenesis and specifically RNA Polymerase I, which transcribes rDNA in the nucleolus, are an area of active research. It has recently been determined that a small subset of platinum compounds is able to cause ribosome biogenesis stress, providing a unique avenue to study this central, conserved process. This study will investigate the influence of platinum compound modifications on nucleolar processes, and also seek to identify the main nucleolar targets of platinum compounds by bioanalytical and chemical biology methods. Developing a molecular-level understanding of the interactions responsible for Pt(II)-induced nucleolar stress would lead to a better understanding of the determinants of nucleolar structure and function.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The National Science Foundation is supporting a U.S. GEOTRACES sampling expedition in the South Pacific and Southern Ocean, one of the most remote and poorly sampled ocean regions on Earth. Neodymium (Nd) isotopes and rare earth elements (REE) are important tools used to track water masses along global circulation pathways, trace the sources of continental inputs into the oceans, and constrain biogeochemical processes in the water column. The investigators will analyze Nd isotopes and REE in seawater, suspended particles, and core top sediments on this expedition. The project will support an early career lead investigator, two postdoctoral researchers, and several undergraduate students. Outreach to local high schools and paid undergraduate research positions are designed to broaden participation in geosciences.<br/><br/>The GP17-OCE cruise track is well-designed for illuminating the processes that govern the marine cycling of REE and Nd isotopes, as it (i) covers the oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre, (ii) crosses the sub-tropical, sub-Antarctic and polar fronts, capturing transitions between different productivity regimes, (iii) traverses through the high latitude South Pacific, which hosts areas with extensive deep water upwelling and new water mass formation. It offers a unique opportunity to study biogeochemically important yet largely unsampled regions in the South Pacific at unprecedented detail. The investigators plan to (1) generate seawater Nd isotope and REE data to characterize the intermediate and deep water masses that form in the high latitude South Pacific, (2) decipher the evolution of dissolved Nd isotope and REE abundances across oceanic fronts and atmospheric dust flux gradients, (3) identify the roles of particle abundance, composition, and size in modulating dissolved Nd isotopes and REE, (4) evaluate the effect of REE contributions from the Antarctic and Chilean margins on water column Nd isotopes and REE inventory, (5) evaluate the impacts of the benthic flux of REE, (6) understand the process of signal transfer between the deep water and sedimentary archives (fossil fish teeth, Fe-Mn oxide coatings).

The aim of this project is to develop methods and tools for commodity mmWave backscattering and enable IoT devices to operate at mmWave frequencies. The proposed mmWave backscattering will enable high-speed, low-power, and low-cost mmWave wireless connectivity to millions of IoT devices.<br/><br/>The project will investigate commodity mmWave backscatter (called mmIDs) and realize a unified mmWave networking and sensing framework where (i) the mmID devices can be integrated into today?s mmWave networks for their seamless high-speed connectivity and (ii) robustness of the mmWave networks can be improved through the presence of densely deployed mmID IoT devices. The project includes four research thrusts: (1) Robust backscatter communication techniques will be developed where mmID tags can exploit the existing mmWave networking protocol messages to modulate their data; (2) Densely deployed mmWave backscatters will be leveraged for proactive blockage mitigation and mobility resilience in WLANs; (3) A high-speed commodity mmWave backscatter will be devised through symbol translation techniques and self-interference mitigation; (4) The commodity mmWave backscatter will be exploited to enable high-accuracy and low-cost sensing with applications in accessibility.

The Pacific Ocean is an important component of oceanic nitrous oxide production and emission to the atmosphere due to its large area and pockets of low oxygen in the eastern tropical Pacific. The largest amounts of nitrous oxide observed in the global ocean occur in these pockets of low oxygen. These regions appear to impact nitrous oxide distributions throughout the Pacific Ocean, but the sources of nitrous oxide in these regions may be quite different. This work will provide a better understanding of both the natural distribution of nitrous oxide in the global ocean, as well as the mechanisms and controls on its production for future emission projections. This will be accomplished by collecting nitrous oxide isotopic measurements at different water depths from the central Pacific, where relatively little work has focused. Measurements of nitrous oxide isotopic composition is a powerful analytical tool that will help to answer these important questions about this powerful greenhouse gas. The Stanford component of this project will be carried out primarily by a PhD student, who will be trained in a variety of laboratory techniques, data analysis, and computer modeling. We will also use support from this project to increase diversity in the Geosciences by providing first-time research experiences to underrepresented minority students through Stanford?s SURGE (Summer Undergraduate Research in Geoscience and Engineering) Program. One of the project?s lead investigators, Bourbonnais, will also give a series of introductory Chemical Oceanography lectures at Benedict College, a private historically black, liberal arts college in Columbia, SC and support two undergraduate students from Benedict College through summer internships at the University of South Carolina. <br/><br/>This project will address three main questions related to N2O cycling in the Pacific Ocean: (1) What features of N2O distribution in the central Pacific Ocean are driven primarily through mixing and circulation vs. biological processes; (2) Which biogeochemical processes control the distribution of biologically produced N2O in the central Pacific Ocean; and (3) How does the production (amount, mechanism, yield) of N2O relate to the availability of oxygen in situ? This collaborative project will be carried under the GEOTRACES program, an international effort to understand the distribution of elements in the global ocean. With the synthesis of the GEOTRACES GP17 and GP15 sections, we will have an opportunity to examine the distributions of N2O and its isotopes (an indicator of production mechanisms) relative to oxygen, trace elements, and water mass tracers.

It is thus essential to understand how adding AI aspects to the tools teams use influences team collaboration, and its implications for organizational practices. This project will address those questions through studying how affective and cognitive processes in teams with AI support intertwine to shape team decision-making performance over time. Insights produced by this research will improve existing knowledge about how AI can be applied to facilitate human collaboration. It will help organizations in various industries make informed decisions about whether and when to adopt AI tools, and develop training and interventions to improve AI-supported team decision-making. The research will also help AI designers better understand AI?s impact on team decision-making and to design more effective AI tools to support collaboration.   <br/><br/>Bridging research perspectives and practices from human-computer interaction (HCI) and team research, this project seeks to develop a human-centered theory on how AI may shape team decision-making processes and outcomes through a set of lab experiments. In the experiments, teams will perform a series of decision-making tasks with AI assistance. The first experiment will vary the communication features of an AI system that provides information and ideas to a team decision-making task, examining how both the presence and the communication style of the AI system affects team interaction processes and decision-making outcomes. The second experiment will vary when AI assistance is employed in different team collaboration stages ? for example, whether AI assistance was introduced at the beginning of the team task or in the middle of the team task. The third experiment will investigate how team turnover during a decision-making task interacts with the use of AI-based tools. Team information sharing, affective status, learning, and performance during the tasks will be observed and analyzed using computational methods. Understanding these processes will contribute to theory on AI-supported team decision-making and in particular, the emergence of team emotion, cognition, and their inter-relations under different conditions of using AI-based tools. The analytical approach can help develop unobtrusive measures of team emotion and cognition and create new research paradigms, measures, and materials (such as task designs and customized chatbots) that can be used by the broader scientific community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The beauty of error-correcting codes and elegance of their decoding algorithms reflect the rich structure of the underlying mathematical objects, but also human creativity and ingenuity. Motivated by recent successes of Deep Neural Networks (DNN) in various applications, this project is investigating if, how, and how efficiently this structure and elegance can be learned by a machine, and how the discovery of new and improved decoding algorithms can be automated. The project is devising parallelizable neural network based decoders with ultra-low latency and improved error performance. The resulting decoders are intended to find broad applicability in emerging wireless standards (5G and beyond) as well as new applications including decoding for quantum computers, machine-to-machine communications, long-haul optical communications and flash memories in data centers.<br/><br/>This project approaches the error-correction problem as classification of the points in a high-dimensional signal space, and uses DNNs to learn complex codeword decision region boundaries to approach the maximum-likelihood decoding performance. The project addresses two key practical challenges: a) achieving extremely low misclassification rates (many orders of magnitude lower) compared to traditional machine learning applications, and b) maintaining low-complexity of decoding via sparse and quantized neural networks. The first thrust utilizes coding-theory domain knowledge, and harnesses the structural similarities between iterative decoders and neural networks for improved learning of decoders. This is achieved by using sampled error patterns from iterative decoding algorithms for stochastic optimization of neural-network decoders. The second thrust focuses on using a new supervised approach for learning decoders, in which existing high-complexity decoders are employed to synthesize a low-complexity neural-network-based decoder with comparable performance. The third thrust establishes theoretical results on the generalization capabilities of neural-network-based decoders (including convergence rates and error performance). This research is providing multi-faceted insight into modern error-correction algorithms and machine learning, and should lead to both theoretical and practical advances of importance to the communications and computer industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The National Science Foundation is supporting a U.S. GEOTRACES sampling expedition in the South Pacific and Southern Ocean, one of the most remote and poorly sampled ocean regions on Earth. Neodymium (Nd) isotopes and rare earth elements (REE) are important tools used to track water masses along global circulation pathways, trace the sources of continental inputs into the oceans, and constrain biogeochemical processes in the water column. The investigators will analyze Nd isotopes and REE in seawater, suspended particles, and core top sediments on this expedition. The project will support an early career lead investigator, two postdoctoral researchers, and several undergraduate students. Outreach to local high schools and paid undergraduate research positions are designed to broaden participation in geosciences.<br/><br/>The GP17-OCE cruise track is well-designed for illuminating the processes that govern the marine cycling of REE and Nd isotopes, as it (i) covers the oligotrophic South Pacific Gyre, (ii) crosses the sub-tropical, sub-Antarctic and polar fronts, capturing transitions between different productivity regimes, (iii) traverses through the high latitude South Pacific, which hosts areas with extensive deep water upwelling and new water mass formation. It offers a unique opportunity to study biogeochemically important yet largely unsampled regions in the South Pacific at unprecedented detail. The investigators plan to (1) generate seawater Nd isotope and REE data to characterize the intermediate and deep water masses that form in the high latitude South Pacific, (2) decipher the evolution of dissolved Nd isotope and REE abundances across oceanic fronts and atmospheric dust flux gradients, (3) identify the roles of particle abundance, composition, and size in modulating dissolved Nd isotopes and REE, (4) evaluate the effect of REE contributions from the Antarctic and Chilean margins on water column Nd isotopes and REE inventory, (5) evaluate the impacts of the benthic flux of REE, (6) understand the process of signal transfer between the deep water and sedimentary archives (fossil fish teeth, Fe-Mn oxide coatings). This information is important for our understanding of Nd cycling in the global ocean and will also facilitate a thorough evaluation of the use of Nd isotopes as a past water circulation proxy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With these new options, there is an opportunity to reduce the cost or environmental impact of storage while improving its reliability and performance.   To realize these benefits, this project explores techniques to use new storage devices together.  By exploring when and how to move data between ?tiers? of new storage, as well as automatically determining what devices to use in data storage tiers, the project dramatically improves storage for both providers and the end users.<br/><br/>This project analyzes methods to detect optimal reconfiguration points using machine-learning and time-series techniques via three interrelated thrusts. In the first thrust, accurate, analytical, multi-tier tail latency models are developed using queuing theory.  Then, the project builds an efficient platform to simulate configurations and investigates methods to estimate tiered-cache reconfiguration costs.  Finally, lightweight, low-overhead, accurate sampling techniques are explored for running systems, to quickly detect significant input/output and cache behavior changes.  In response, this project further builds techniques to reconfigure a tiered-cache on running systems with minimal interference.  Empirical case studies are applied to Memcached and Kubernetes containers.<br/><br/>The storage community benefits from multiple artifacts this project produces: an open-source versatile multi-tier cache simulator, workload and analytical latency models, several case studied systems, a database of metrics from empirically evaluated devices, and publications reporting unexpected or counter-intuitive results.  Storage consumers (e.g., companies) can simulate many ?what-if? scenarios before actually purchasing any hardware, so as to avoid under- or over-provisioning.  This project develops new course modules including short video tutorials.  Several students, including women and members of underrepresented groups, are mentored and trained in research techniques.<br/><br/>The project's artifacts?software, source code, data sets, multi-tier cache simulator, traces, and results?are all embodied in a system we call ""MTCache: Multi-Tier Cache"".

This project focuses on how to securely program, deploy, and manage IoT systems and applications.<br/><br/>Specifically, the project will develop a portable, multi-tier (sensors, edge, cloud) platform, called Detroit, that supports ""write-once-run-anywhere"" programming for IoT devices. The platform will enable low-latency data analytics and response in or near the sensing tier, while leveraging emerging public cloud computing technologies at the edge and cloud tiers.  High-level language support and platform services (for monitoring, security policy enforcement, and deployment management) will be used to hide the complexities of IoT, give developers tools with which they can specify and automatically check security and deployment properties, and automate placement, end-to-end authentication, and repair/update for IoT applications.<br/><br/>The project will enable secure IoT innovation to become broadly practiced rather than solely the domain of distributed and embedded systems experts. Such democratization is key to realizing the positive societal transformation and shared economic impact that the IoT promises is possible. In addition, the project will use real-world IoT testbeds and applications, from several other scientific domains (e.g., smart homes, digital agriculture, and ecology), to evaluate and demonstrate the advances and to ensure that they are useful to developers and researchers across disciplines.<br/><br/>Finally, the project will develop, collect, and maintain source code, datasets, and results related to this effort that will be shared publicly via the GitHub repository https://github.com/MAYHEM-Lab/Detroit.

It will do so by researching how students in introductory mathematics use online resources to support their learning. A key focus area of the project is developing classroom interventions that support access in STEM by helping all students develop productive strategies for online study. Undergraduate students increasingly make use of online resources under their own direction and out of view of their instructors. This study practice is particularly notable in introductory mathematics classes where students often see online resources as critical to their success. Unfortunately, introductory mathematics classes play a gatekeeping role on the path to STEM fields for many undergraduates. Thus, ineffective use of online resources to learn introductory mathematics can decrease a student?s chances of persisting in STEM.  This project will use a nationwide survey to build a knowledge base about how students are using online resources to navigate their introductory mathematics classes. Those results will be used to develop classroom interventions that help mathematics instructors and students gain a shared understanding of the most effective practices for using online resources to promote student success.  <br/><br/>This project will use an explanatory mixed methods study to develop a theoretical model of how students work with online resources to learn mathematics. That theory will form the basis for the iterative development of classroom interventions that will help bridge the current divide between student and instructor understandings of the role of these online resources. These interventions will target introductory mathematics courses that often serve as gatekeepers, particularly for first-generation students and students from communities that are underrepresented in STEM. Evaluation of the interventions' success will be based on how well they support students? mathematical understanding and achievement in mathematics. This project will contribute to the STEM education community by using a rigorous methodological approach, which can be applied to other disciplines, to develop a theoretical model of the strategies that students employ when working with online resources to learn mathematics. In doing so, the project will contribute to educators? and researchers? understanding of how to support equitable STEM instruction by examining how the use of online resources in lower-division mathematics classes differs according to student background. This work will bring together multiple strands of education research including technology and education, mathematics education, and information literacy, and contribute to pedagogical practice through the collaborative development of formative interventions that will be refined through iterative design-based research in multiple classroom settings. The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that supports early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education.

This includes providing multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. <br/><br/>The Ice Worlds media project will inspire millions of children and adults to gain new knowledge about polar environments, the planet?s climate, and humanity?s place within Earth?s complex systems?supporting an informed, STEM literate citizenry. Featuring the NSF-funded THOR expedition to Thwaites glacier, along with contributions of many NSF-supported researchers worldwide, Ice Worlds will share the importance of investments in STEM with audiences in giant screen theaters, on television, online, and in other informal settings.  Primary project deliverables include a giant screen film, a filmmaking workshop for Native American middle school students that will result in a documentary, a climate storytelling professional development program for informal educators, and a knowledge-building summative evaluation. The project?s largest target audience is middle school learners (ages 11-14); specific activities are designed for Native American youth and informal science practitioners.  Innovative outreach will engage youth underserved in science inspiring a new generation of scientists and investigative thinkers. The project?s professional development programs will build the capacity of informal educators to engage communities and communicate science. The Ice Worlds project is a collaboration among media producers Giant Screen Films, Natural History New Zealand, PBS, and Academy Award nominated film directors (Yes/No Productions).  Additional collaborators include Northwestern University, The American Indian Science and Engineering Society, the Native American Journalism Association, a group of museum and science center partners, and a team of advisors including scientific and Indigenous experts associated with the NSF-funded Study of Environmental Arctic Change initiative.<br/><br/>The goals of the project are: 1) to increase public understanding of the processes and consequences of environmental change in polar ecosystems, 2) to explore the effectiveness of the giant screen format to impart knowledge, inspire motivation and caring for nature, 3) to improve middle schoolers? interest, confidence and engagement in STEM topics and pursuits?broadly and through a specific program for Native American youth, and 4) to build informal educators? capacity to share stories of climate change in their communities.  The main evaluation questions are 1) to what extent does the Ice World film affect learning, engagement, and motivation around STEM  pursuits and environmental problem solving 2) what is the added value of companion media for youth?s giant screen learning over short and longer term, and 3) what are the impacts of the culturally based Native American youth workshops.<br/><br/>The evaluation work will involve a Native American youth advisory panel and a panel of science center practitioners in the giant screen film?s development and evaluation process.

Compared with other methods, kNN methods have several advantages. In particular, kNN methods can automatically adapt to any continuous underlying functions without relying on any specific models. In addition, kNN methods are simple to use and do not require too much parameter tuning. Furthermore, kNN methods have achieved excellent empirical results. Due to these advantages, kNN methods are widely used in a large variety of statistical problems, including functional-estimation and machine-learning problems. However, the understanding of theoretical properties of kNN methods for these applications is incomplete. As the result, there is a pressing need to investigate the theoretical properties of kNN methods. By addressing the main sources of estimation errors identified by these investigations, one can design improved kNN methods that have better performance.<br/><br/>In this project, the investigator is investigating: 1) theoretical properties of kNN methods in functional estimation and machine learning problems; and 2) the design of improved kNN algorithms with better performance for these applications. Despite many existing studies, several theoretical problems still need further investigation. In particular: 1) The theoretical convergence rates of kNN methods for functional estimations, classification and regression, etc., are still not fully established; 2) For many applications of practical interests, it is not clear under what conditions this type of methods is optimal; 3) Most of the existing analysis of kNN methods rely on availability of independent and identically distributed training data, while in certain applications (such as those involving Markov chains) the available data are dependent; 4) While there are many applications and analysis of kNN methods for supervised learning, the applications and analysis of kNN methods for reinforcement learning etc. are limited. To address these challenges, this project is focusing on two interconnected thrusts. In the first thrust, the project is investigating the application of kNN methods in the estimation of information-theoretic functionals, including entropy, mutual information, Kullback-Leibler divergence, directed information, etc. In the second thrust, the project is designing and analyzing kNN based algorithms for machine learning problems, including supervised learning, nonconvex optimization and reinforcement learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Pacific Ocean is an important component of oceanic nitrous oxide production and emission to the atmosphere due to its large area and pockets of low oxygen in the eastern tropical Pacific. The largest amounts of nitrous oxide observed in the global ocean occur in these pockets of low oxygen. These regions appear to impact nitrous oxide distributions throughout the Pacific Ocean, but the sources of nitrous oxide in these regions may be quite different. This work will provide a better understanding of both the natural distribution of nitrous oxide in the global ocean, as well as the mechanisms and controls on its production for future emission projections. This will be accomplished by collecting nitrous oxide isotopic measurements at different water depths from the central Pacific, where relatively little work has focused. Measurements of nitrous oxide isotopic composition is a powerful analytical tool that will help to answer these important questions about this powerful greenhouse gas. The Stanford component of this project will be carried out primarily by a PhD student, who will be trained in a variety of laboratory techniques, data analysis, and computer modeling. We will also use support from this project to increase diversity in the Geosciences by providing first-time research experiences to underrepresented minority students through Stanford?s SURGE (Summer Undergraduate Research in Geoscience and Engineering) Program. One of the project?s lead investigators, Bourbonnais, will also give a series of introductory Chemical Oceanography lectures at Benedict College, a private historically black, liberal arts college in Columbia, SC and support two undergraduate students from Benedict College through summer internships at the University of South Carolina. <br/><br/>This project will address three main questions related to N2O cycling in the Pacific Ocean: (1) What features of N2O distribution in the central Pacific Ocean are driven primarily through mixing and circulation vs. biological processes; (2) Which biogeochemical processes control the distribution of biologically produced N2O in the central Pacific Ocean; and (3) How does the production (amount, mechanism, yield) of N2O relate to the availability of oxygen in situ? This collaborative project will be carried under the GEOTRACES program, an international effort to understand the distribution of elements in the global ocean. With the synthesis of the GEOTRACES GP17 and GP15 sections, we will have an opportunity to examine the distributions of N2O and its isotopes (an indicator of production mechanisms) relative to oxygen, trace elements, and water mass tracers.

Moreover, historical changes in STEM (e.g., maker spaces, and women?s growing representation in science and mathematics) have prompted questions about whether STEM historical movements have shifted the opportunity structures supporting students? STEM motivation. Through this project, the researchers take advantage of seven extant datasets to test the following five aims among demographically diverse students across historical time: (1) examining changes and patterns in students? 1st to 12th grade mathematics and science motivational beliefs; (2) testing the extent to which the changes in students? motivation predict their mathematics and science achievement and coursework, and STEM college/career choices; (3) determining the extent to which parent STEM experience and support predict students? motivation; (4) examining intersectionality among gender, race/ethnicity, and college generation in Aims 1-3; and (5) testing conceptual replication across datasets and historical time for Aims 1-4. The datasets include large, local longitudinal datasets and nationally representative datasets, which cover the 1980?s to present day.

Using seven existing data sets, this research will explore who is motivated to pursue mathematics and science, what sustains students? motivation, and if those processes vary across development and historical time. The project focuses on broadening participation of underrepresented individuals by investigating their mathematics and science motivational beliefs, STEM outcomes, and parental correlates. Testing these processes across multiple datasets provides a more comprehensive understanding of group differences in terms of measurement, mean-level differences, and process-level differences. This information is fundamental for rigorous research and helps identify groups that might benefit from interventions and which supports might be most beneficial for whom. The current project extends prior work to focus on equity, diversifying the STEM workforce, and providing more concrete insight into the specific pathways toward promoting and enhancing STEM participation for underrepresented groups. Moreover, the strategy to conceptually replicate findings across multiple large-scale datasets is a strong test of theory and provides insights into the universality of processes across distinct groups of intersecting identities and developmental periods. Using datasets that vary historically allows the researchers to test whether participation in STEM has broadened over past decades and if the processes supporting participation have changed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this research is to develop such knowledge extraction and reuse techniques with the aid of the state-of-the-art machine learning technology. The outcome of this research is to help mitigate the chip-design productivity crisis and cater to the increasing demand for hardware-accelerated computing. This research is also training students, including women and under-represented minorities, with interdisciplinary skills and preparing tomorrow?s high-tech workforce in the U.S. for solving challenges in the electronic industry.<br/><br/>The project involves systematic research on machine learning in the context of electronic design automation with five integrated components: 1) development of learning-based fast and high fidelity prediction techniques for knowledge extraction in the structural and behavioral domains of circuit designs; 2) a study on how to seamlessly integrate the design predictions with circuit optimizations; 3) applying machine-learning prediction to accelerating functional-verification coverage and facilitating automated debugging; 4) developing autonomous learning on the interplay amongst tools and thereby achieving automated synthesis space exploration; 5) automated machine-learning architecture search and feature refinement in EDA applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With these new options, there is an opportunity to reduce the cost or environmental impact of storage while improving its reliability and performance.   To realize these benefits, this project explores techniques to use new storage devices together.  By exploring when and how to move data between ?tiers? of new storage, as well as automatically determining what devices to use in data storage tiers, the project dramatically improves storage for both providers and the end users.<br/><br/>This project analyzes methods to detect optimal reconfiguration points using machine-learning and time-series techniques via three interrelated thrusts. In the first thrust, accurate, analytical, multi-tier tail latency models are developed using queuing theory.  Then, the project builds an efficient platform to simulate configurations and investigates methods to estimate tiered-cache reconfiguration costs.  Finally, lightweight, low-overhead, accurate sampling techniques are explored for running systems, to quickly detect significant input/output and cache behavior changes.  In response, this project further builds techniques to reconfigure a tiered-cache on running systems with minimal interference.  Empirical case studies are applied to Memcached and Kubernetes containers.<br/><br/>The storage community benefits from multiple artifacts this project produces: an open-source versatile multi-tier cache simulator, workload and analytical latency models, several case studied systems, a database of metrics from empirically evaluated devices, and publications reporting unexpected or counter-intuitive results.  Storage consumers (e.g., companies) can simulate many ?what-if? scenarios before actually purchasing any hardware, so as to avoid under- or over-provisioning.  This project develops new course modules including short video tutorials.  Several students, including women and members of underrepresented groups, are mentored and trained in research techniques.<br/><br/>The project's artifacts?software, source code, data sets, multi-tier cache simulator, traces, and results?are all embodied in a system we call ""MTCache: Multi-Tier Cache"".  Results will be disseminated using peer-reviewed publications and arxiv.org.  All artifacts will be made public through the project Website: https://www.filesystems.org/mtcache.

Liquid droplets adopt spherical shapes due to surface tension.  It was recently discovered that, for over 60 different chemical combinations, the surface of droplets, which is covered with molecules called surfactants, can undergo freezing, which induces drastic changes in the shape of the droplets. This interfacial freezing (IF) phenomenon leads to the formation of faceted liquid droplets, thin platelets or rod/hair-like emulsion droplets. On one hand, these shape transformations may lead to major complications in industrial processes, such as pipe clogging by hair-like droplets. On the other hand, these shape transformations provide a powerful method of synthesizing particles with complex shapes for advanced applications. In numerous industrial and natural settings, the interfaces of emulsion droplets are covered by mixtures of surfantants and solid microparticles, known as colloids. However, the influence of surface-adsorbing colloids on the IF and droplet faceting phenomena has not been extensively investigated, although such colloids are present in many real-world emulsions. The proposed work aims to understand the effect of colloids on the shape transformation of emulsion droplets undergoing IF.  Developing a deep understanding of the effect of particle size, concentration, shape and surface chemistry on the shape transformation of emulsions will enable strategies to prevent deleterious impacts of such phenomena in the food, oil and gas, pharmaceutical and cosmetic industries and lead to novel synthesis techniques to create new materials.<br/><br/>The composition, structure and elasticity of the droplet interface play a crucial role in determining the stability, encapsulation capability and processability of emulsions in industry and in common chemical and biological systems. In many emulsions, the interfacial molecular layer can undergo a freezing transition, dramatically modifying the emulsion properties. This interfacial freezing (IF) transition drastically changes the shape of the emulsion droplets for sizes spanning 13 orders of magnitude in volume, and for over 60 different oil-surfactant combinations. Such shape transitions may lead to the formation of faceted liquid objects, high aspect ratio platelets or rod/hair-like emulsion droplets, changing the flow properties of the emulsions and potentially causing gelation leading to process complications. Engineering shape transformations of droplets also provides a powerful method of synthesizing highly shape-anisotropic particles with unique functionality. In numerous industrial and natural settings, the interfaces of the emulsions are decorated by mixtures of particles and surfactants, with the particles either added intentionally for emulsion stabilization, or being present as a contaminant. This project aims at understanding the interplay between the surface-adsorbed particles and the IF phenomena, with a particular focus on the effect of isotropic and Janus particles on the shape transformations. Using particle tracking and recently developed microfluidic methods, this project will investigate the effect of wetting properties, size, shape and interfacial concentration of particles on IF-driven shape transformations of droplets. While conventional isotropic colloids may be easily expelled from a droplet interface undergoing IF due to extremely low interfacial tension, Janus particles will strongly adsorb to such an interface due to their intrinsic surface activity, potentially enabling control over the shape transformation. New methods to control the IF-driven self-shaping of droplets will have a potentially transformative impact for oil and gas, pharmaceutical, food, agricultural and cosmetics industries, where emulsions are frequently exposed to surfactant- and particle-containing media. A new demonstration illustrating the interplay between the interfacial curvature and crystallization will be developed by undergraduate and graduate students for local high school teachers and students. To broaden participation of students from underrepresented groups, students with diverse backgrounds will be recruited by hosting students from the University of Puerto Rico-Humacao and by collaborating with Advancing Women in Engineering and Louise-Stoke Alliance for Minority Participation programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diffusion tends to spread out clusters and tries to disperse them, while mixing weaves the clusters and tends to intersperse layers of one cluster with another. This project seeks to quantify their interaction and determine how it impacts the dynamics of physical and chemical fluid systems.  Improving the understanding of how they interact has both direct and indirect consequences in scientific areas, such as the study of chemotaxis, of phase separation of binary mixtures including alloys, and of the earth's magnetic field. The research will be carried out with active involvement from students and postdoctoral associates, who will be trained across a broad range of fields.<br/><br/>This project will examine several issues concerning enhanced dissipation, diffusion, and mixing. In incompressible fluids, stirring induces mixing by filamentation and facilitates the formation of small scales.

Four goals of the project are to construct simple and explicit family of flows that enhance dissipation by an arbitrarily large amount; to use dissipation enhancement to address physically meaningful questions concerning nonlinear partial differential equations; to obtain sharp estimates for the dissipation enhancement in terms of the mixing rates; and to investigate residual diffusivity, and the effect of dissipation enhancement on the long-time behavior of magnetic fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons are ubiquitous molecules that occur in practically all carbonaceous materials, including ones as familiar to the general public as soot.  Facilitation as well as inhibition of aggregation requires understanding of the driving forces for this process at the molecular level.  Such molecular level of understanding is central to the control of the formation of functional carbon nanomaterials and crucial for the rational development of organic semiconductors for application in electronic and optical technologies, such as organic solar cells, electronic sensors and quantum computing systems.  During the course of conducting this collaborative project, graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds will be trained, and summer courses on the science of soft matter that are geared towards high school students will be conducted.  The software protocols developed will be publicly shared with the scientific community and tutorials on quantum mechanical methods geared to the general public will be developed. <br/> <br/>The project addresses an urgently needed systematic study of the radical and biradical character of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon molecules and its role in their aggregation into nano-sized structures.  Molecular level understanding of cluster formation is crucial for the rational development of organic nanocarbons for application in electronic and optical technologies.   Computational modeling with highest-level quantum chemical methods (multireference theory) in combination with lower level, but computationally more efficient methods (ab initio single reference methods and density functional theory) will be employed.  Descriptors will be used to construct and calculate promising dimer and trimer stacking combinations to evaluate the pancake interaction strength and compare them with experimental observations. These quantum chemical simulations will be extended by global modeling activities which will reflect in more detail the condensed phase structure based on the available interaction data of the quantum chemical calculations. This project includes collaboration with two experimental groups, providing structural and other characterization data. This project is expected to lead to a new and systematic approach to data collection based on computational work in the form of structural and energetic information with additional descriptors for biradical character.

Veige and Brent S. Sumerlin of University of Florida are developing new synthetic approaches for the preparation of functional conjugated polymers.  Conjugated polymers are a unique class of polymers that contain long carbon chains with the repeating unit consisting of an olefin group bearing a carbon-carbon pi-bond.  Such groups bring unsaturation to a chemical compound and are very commonly found in many natural products, such as cholesterol and fatty acids.  In the case of conjugated polymers, when these pi-bonds are broken they create positive and negative charges along the polymer chain allowing them to conduct electricity.  Since conjugated polymers contain tens of thousands of pi-bonds, their conductivity can sometimes surpass that of common metals such as copper or aluminum.  In this research, a tungsten catalyst will first be used to prepare conjugated cyclic polymers which have the ability to interlock within themselves like beads on a string.  These polymers will then be further modified synthetically in order to study and improve their optical and electronic properties.  Polymeric materials prepared in this research have potential applications in the areas of molecular electronics and energy absorbing materials.  The research activities associated with this award are also directed at broadening participation and enabling the training of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in polymer chemistry.  The outreach event ?Halloween Molecular Mania? provides an attractive strategy to generate interest in science to participating high school students, local teachers and their parents.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the use of tungsten-catalyzed ring expansion metathesis polymerization for the synthesis of various types of cyclic polymers.  In the first goal, catenated (pi-bond interlocked) cyclic analogues of polyacetylene will be prepared and characterized.  Special focus will be placed on detailed reaction kinetics and on the use of imaging (atomic force microscopy) and rheological studies to provide conclusive evidence of catenation.  Induction of a long-lived singlet fission is to be achieved by attaching conjugated chromophores to cyclic polymers in the second goal.  Singlet fission is a spin-allowed process, which could lead to long sought improved photo-conversion efficiencies with these linear pi-conjugated polymers.  Lastly, the research team aims to achieve low barriers to configuration isomerization in the prepared cyclic polymers.  This will be explored to synthesize semi-conducting cyclic polymers via an intramolecular pi-bond shift.  This research has the potential to yield new knowledge in the area of cyclic polymers and provide mechanistic understanding for further catalyst design.  Furthermore, access to semi-conducting cyclic polymers would provide important new opportunities to probe the fundamental principles of electrical conductivity in organic materials.

Frames have natural connections with the mathematical theory of quantum communications. For example, phase-retrievability of a frame is an important property that allows the recovery of a signal from the magnitudes of its frame coefficient measurements. This appears in many applications including speech recognition, x-ray crystallography and electron microscopy. In quantum information theory, this is a necessary property for a quantum system to have to distinguish pure states from their quantum measurements. This project addresses several fundamental issues in the area. The principal investigator (PI) will investigate frame applications to problems involving quantum communication capability and information transmission security. By bringing a new circle of ideas to attack these practical problems, this investigation will advance scientific understanding in quantum information theory as well as in applied functional/harmonic analysis. Additionally, this project will promote teaching, training, and learning as several graduate and undergraduate students will be directly involved in this research project.<br/><br/>One direction of this investigation is to establish quantified measurements of (mostly, operator-valued) frame phase-retrievability, and then use them to tackle problems of designing (or characterizing) quantum communication channels with prescribed levels of zero-error communication capacity and information transmission security. Special attention will be given to the structured channels, which are usually induced by different kinds of representation frames. Here, the interplay between operator-valued frames and projective group representations will play a key role. A second direction of this project is in the area of signal/state recovering (or channel detection) from a source of unidentified channels. The PI will establish its theoretical connections with the theory of disjoint frames and quantum channels. A key ingredient is to use disjoint frames as building blocks to produce a large class of candidates, where any subclass of this set can be used as a source of unidentified channels for a target set of signals or states in the quantum setting. Such an approach requires developing a disjoint frame theory (or multiplexing) for bounded linear maps on von Neumann algebras. A third direction involves quantum measures. Dilation problems for quantum measures are not only in the scope of aforementioned areas of investigation but also in line with the PI?s long-term goal of establishing a general dilation theory for operator-valued measures in both commutative and non-commutative settings.

This research aims to gain a better understanding of the factors that will lead to specific interactions with different carbohydrates in order to provide guiding principles for future design of sugar receptors and sensors.  This collaborative project integrates experiments with theoretical studies and provides a great platform for research training of undergraduate and graduate students, including students of underrepresented groups. The research results will be incorporated into teaching and broadly disseminated to the scientific community. <br/><br/>The host molecules are aromatic oligoamide foldamers with tunable lengths.  The oligoamides fold into helical coil structures with multiple hydrogen bond acceptors being directed toward the nanosized hollow core.  When embedded in a lipid bilayer membrane in aqueous solution, the helical coils stack to create channels through which ions and small molecules flow from one side of the membrane to the other side.  With the numerous H-bonding sites, different sugars and sugar alcohols are expected to interact with the inner pore of the helical coil with different affinities.  Such interaction, being dynamic and transient, especially in water, will perturb the ion currents through the transmembrane pores. This research team will (1) optimize the synthesis of the oligoamides, (2) perform one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic studies and X-ray crystallographic structural analysis to interrogate the interactions between the host and specific carbohydrates to include monosaccharides, disaccharides, and higher oligosaccharides; (3) examine the effects of various carbohydrate guests on the transmembrane ion currents through the helical pores; and (4) carry out computational studies to optimize host-guest binding and to probe the effect carbohydrate guests have on transmembrane ion flows through the helical pores.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These flows are characterized by the deformation of geometric objects such as metrics, mappings, and submanifolds by geometric quantities such as curvature and consist of partial differential equations of parabolic type. Geometric flows appear in many real world applications. For example, surface tension along moving interfaces in fluids and materials is proportional to mean curvature; mean curvature flow and affine mean curvature flow are useful for image processing. However, studying geometric equations can be challenging due to nonlinearities and the possible development of singularities, especially topological changes. One way to understand those singularities is to zoom in and understand how solutions look as they approach the singular time after which a smooth solution no longer exists. During this limiting process we get special solutions to a geometric equation that are called ancient solutions, which have existed for an infinite amount of time in the past. Understanding those solutions could be useful in obtaining more topological and geometric information about a geometric object. The project will also include training of students and the mentoring of junior researchers.<br/><br/>The aim of the project is the classification of ancient solutions to nonlinear geometric flows, such as, the Ricci flow and the mean curvature flow. This project will combine the PDE techniques and geometric estimates to study ancient solutions of these flows. The goal is to classify ancient closed noncollapsed solutions to higher dimensional Ricci flow (cases n = 2, 3 have been solved), under the assumption that solution becomes asymptotically cylindrical as time approaches minus infinity. One motivation for this classification comes from showing an analogue of the Mean Convex Neighborhood Theorem for the Ricci flow. This could potentially enable us to perform surgery in the Ricci flow in higher dimensions without assuming global curvature conditions initially. As a continuation of a completed project with collaborators, PI will investigate noncollapsed ancient solutions to the mean curvature flow that are asymptotic to other generalized round cylinders besides the well understood case of a round cylinder.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These systems depend on a variety of parameters, and as these parameters change, the corresponding system is affected. Understanding how dynamical systems change with different parameters is a very complicated and delicate question that is not even completely understood in the simplest of mathematical models. However, there is one shining success story in this regard: that is, the parameter space, or ""moduli space"", of complex quadratic polynomials. This space contains the famous Mandelbrot Set, which has been thoroughly studied over the last 40 years. The research outlined in this proposal explores different parameter spaces associated to particular dynamical systems, with a view toward understanding them to the same extent that the mathematical community understands the space where the Mandelbrot set lives. This proposal also contains a significant outreach component to support the Math Corps at U(M), a free math Summer Camp for middle school students and high school mentors.<br/><br/>A major goal in the field of complex dynamics is to understand dynamical moduli spaces. The most successful endeavor in this regard has been the study of the moduli space of quadratic polynomials where the Mandelbrot Set lives, a fundamental object in the subject. Ultimately, we strive to understand the moduli space of rational maps of arbitrary degree to the same extent that we understand the moduli space of quadratic polynomials. Many tools from complex analysis that pave the way for key breakthroughs in the one-dimensional setting do not carry over to higher dimensions. So instead of considering the whole moduli space, PI follows an approach initiated by William Thurston and investigate sub-varieties of moduli space. The most natural sub-varieties to study are those that come from dynamical conditions, like imposing combinatorial constraints on the forward orbits of critical points. One may view Thurston?s Topological Characterization of Rational Maps as a first step. It provides a way to understand zero-dimensional dynamical sub-varieties; that is, those that consist of postcritically finite parameters. Following Epstein, the PI will adapt Thurston?s ideas and constructions and shall develop a setting in which to study higher-dimensional dynamical sub-varieties of moduli spaces. PI will explore this theory by working with one-dimensional dynamical sub-varieties in the moduli space of quadratic rational maps, and one-dimensional dynamical sub-varieties in the moduli space of cubic polynomials, where there are already very challenging and fundamental problems concerning their topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Compactly representing such files is generally a good idea for many practical reasons. Compressed music and image files (MP3, JPG, etc.) are much faster and cheaper to communicate and store than the originals. In classification applications, a small number of informative file features are often selected from larger categories of data in order to help boost accuracy and efficiency (this is akin to only focusing on the voice in a song when the aim is to identify the singer). In more extreme situations, data signals may be so large or change so rapidly that they cannot be stored or analyzed at all without first being quickly compressed. Many interesting problems of this type exist in research areas related to algorithms for internet data analysis aimed at, for example, quickly detecting particular types of large-scale cyber-attacks. As part of this project, the investigators will develop and implement new faster compression and data analysis techniques for complex data, which can then be used to facilitate faster data processing in a myriad of large-scale data processing applications. The project will also have educational benefits aimed at increasing the representation of students from under-represented and under-served groups in STEM research fields. This will be accomplished by the investigators hosting and mentoring research projects for undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds who will apply the compression and data analysis techniques developed as part of this research to specific application data, for example, to analyze and better understand Lyme disease data.<br/><br/>This research includes a rich new class of practical Johnson-Lindenstrauss (JL) maps for vector data that cannot only be applied to vectors faster than Fast Fourier Transform time serially but are also trivially parallelizable.

These techniques will then allow, for example, the construction of new fast and memory efficient embeddings with the Tensor Restricted Isometry Property of value in the analysis of large tensor data. In addition, the research will develop new nonlinear bi-Lipchitz extensions of linear modewise JL-maps for tensor data capable of preserving distances between all low rank tensors in a given database and all other lower rank tensors, even outside of the database.

For example, seismic waves can be used to learn about geological formations, and ultrasonic waves can be used to analyze rock samples in the laboratory. Wave propagation speed is determined by the compressibility of the material through which it passes. Because many geological materials are porous and filled with liquids (water, brine, petroleum, etc.), wave propagation depends on the compressibilities of both the solid and liquid parts.  Therefore, by knowing the individual compressibility properties one can use wave propagation to determine how much liquid is contained within the pores of a solid. However, when the pore diameters measure a few nanometers across, the liquids confined in those pores may have very different compressibility properties than in bulk. This research project aims to quantify how confinement in nanopores changes the compressibility of a range of liquids. This research will advance the understanding of wave propagation in important nanoporous media, such as hydrocarbon-bearing shale. The knowledge gained from this research could contribute towards the more efficient exploration and development of energy resources, carbon dioxide sequestration, and large-scale energy storage technologies. This research project will contribute to improved STEM education through the inclusion of research-related topics in the undergraduate courses taught at the university. During the summer months high school interns from the NJIT ACS-SEED program for economically disadvantaged high-school students will work on projects related to this research.<br/><br/>The objective of this research project is to explore the effects of confinement on the compressibility of fluids by means of adsorption-ultrasonic experiments. When fluids are confined in nanopores, many of their physico-chemical properties change as compared to bulk. A small number of experimental studies suggest that the compressibility of fluids confined in nanopores also deviates from the compressibility of the same fluids in bulk. Modeling studies predict that the departure of compressibility progressively increases with decreasing pore size. Thus, the central hypothesis of this research project is that confinement will change the elastic properties of all fluids when the pore size is comparable to the fluid molecule size and that the extent of this change is determined by the pore size and strength of the solid-fluid interactions. This research project will test this hypothesis experimentally and explore the effects of other parameters, such as the properties of the pore surface and the structure of the fluid molecules. Experimental confirmation of a significant departure of nano-confined fluid compressibility from the corresponding bulk values has transformative potential, requiring the revision of wave propagation theory in porous media when the media are nanoporous. This research project also will promote novel interdisciplinary perspectives by connecting the studies of compressibility of confined fluids (molecular thermodynamics) to studies of wave propagation in porous media (geophysics).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This involves vigorous interactions between current systems like the Gulf Stream and fast wave motions that cannot be seen by current global ocean computer models. Overall, the proposed work has broad impacts within fluid mechanics, physical oceanography, and its training aspects include both graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The fluid dynamics of these complex systems is characterized by a nonlinear jigsaw puzzle of intermingling turbulent waves and vortices, especially at small scales, such as those relevant to submesoscale oceanography, for instance. Here classical wave-mean interaction theory fails, direct numerical simulation of the fluid motion with global computational models is not possible, and theoretical innovations for diagnostic and predictive models are needed. In this connection the present proposal seeks to break new ground with a multi-pronged approach that combines theory and numerical modelling. First, the long term evolution of turbulent internal wave spectra under refraction by the balanced mean flow is studied using a novel wave action advection-diffusion theory. Second, vigorous two-way interactions between internal waves and the balanced mean flow are studied using new wave-mean interaction equations derived from generalized Lagrangian-mean theory. These equations allow for strong interactions that cut both ways: the waves feel the mean flow and vice versa.

These traits determine how individuals interact with their environment (ecology) which then influences the course of evolution. Thus, ecology and evolution are inextricably intertwined. Bridging the fields of evolution and ecology is challenging because the processes involved can operate on similar, or very different, time scales. African savanna acacia trees have evolved to survive and reproduce under harsh conditions not tolerated by many other tree species. Acacias can tolerate fires, droughts, herbivory by giraffes and elephants, and competition from other plants. But how acacias have adapted to these conditions in the past will influence their response to the current changing environment on the African continent. The goal of this study is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary history and ecological distribution of African acacias and to explore how species traits and distributions changed over time in response to change in the savanna climate. Ultimately, this knowledge will inform predictions about how acacia habitats will be affected by ongoing climate change. This project not only has broader societal benefit but also it will train undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in evolutionary biology, ecology, plant physiology, and molecular genomics. In addition, the project will expand the content and reach of a successful undergraduate teaching module of ecology and evolution featuring Serengeti National Park and will begin a new bioinformatics training course in partnership with universities in Africa.<br/><br/>This project will bridge phylogenetic approaches to diversification with direct ecological field measurement of trait responses and gene expression. The activities include: (1) constructing new, detailed models of the phylogenetic history and ecological distribution of species and traits in the African Acacia Clade, (2) using phylogenomic analyses to study selection, introgression, and gene family expansion in relation to the Savanna Syndrome, (3) measuring acacia trait responses to Savanna Syndrome components (drought, fire, herbivory, grass competition) in a common garden experiment in Arusha, Tanzania, and (4) analyzing the molecular aspects of the phenotypic response through analysis of acacia transcriptomic profiles collected both on site in Tanzania and in controlled greenhouse experiments. Collectively, these linked lines of evidence will provide crucial information about the past evolution of the savanna community, the rapid rise of savannas across Africa that occurred in the Miocene, and its likely response to present ecological change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although environmental identity has come to be understood as an important component in children?s future knowledge of and commitment to the environment, little is known about how elementary school-aged children begin to construct a meaningful environmental identity and how the adults in their lives can support them in doing so, particularly among Indigenous children and families. The project will address this research gap. Building on Molly of Denali, a PBS KIDS animated children?s series that features an Indigenous lead character, the project team will explore how children in rural Alaska Native villages relate to their environments, how parents and other community adults conceive of environmental identity and regard their role in nurturing it with children, and how the project team can leverage these research findings, along with positive perceptions of Molly of Denali, to create an intergenerational, community-based learning program that engages Alaska Native families in environmental science learning while contributing to children?s environmental identity development.<br/><br/>The design-based research project will unfold over three phases: (1) formative research, during which the team will collaborate with three communities to conduct initial research into how 6- to 8-year-old children from rural Alaska Native villages relate to their place and environment; the role adults play in fostering this relationship, and how community assets and technology resources are being used, or could be used, to support science exploration in informal environments; (2) iterative co-design and testing, during which the team will work closely with two rural Alaska Native communities to develop, test, and revise an implementation model and set of prototype multimedia resources for an intergenerational community science program that supports environmental identity development; and (3) scale-pp evaluation, during which Alaska-based evaluator Goldstream Group will work with additional rural Alaska Native communities to assess the revised model and resources and learn more about factors that could support or impede wider implementation of finished materials across Alaska. The materials will be tested with families from at least 4 communities engaging a total of 24 children. The project will also include a process evaluation that will investigate the co-design process. Across all phases, the project will engage children as active researchers, capturing their lived experiences in nature via drawings, descriptions, and child-led nature tours that employ portable cameras. Data will also be collected from informal educators (e.g., library workers, public media representatives), community members (e.g., tribal Elders, local STEM professionals), and parents via interviews and focus group discussions.  Throughout, researchers will use qualitative approaches (e.g.,content, narrative, discourse, framework analyses)to identify and describe behaviors associated with environmental identity development and will share findings with the field.

The second is to characterize the passage of singular limits in the isentropic approximation process for both inviscid and viscous fluids, and to derive error estimates in such approximations. The last is to establish the mathematically rigorous validity of nonlinear dynamical Rayleigh-Taylor type instability in compressible fluids subject to gravity, in particular for the compressible Navier-Stokes-Fourier system, where heat transfer plays an essential role.

The broader impacts of this project lie in the professional development of the PI's graduate students and postdocs, the dissemination of research through talks and the Northwestern Geometry/Physics seminar, and through the PI's many outreach activities.<br/><br/>A common thread within the project is an understanding of a moduli space of objects in a category defined by a Legendrian subspace.  In collaborative work with Linhui Shen, the PI will use cluster theory to determine generating functions for all-genus open Gromov-Witten invariants of certain Lagrangian three-folds filling Legendrian surfaces, given the data of a framing.  These generating functions are interpreted as wave functions for branes wrapping the Lagrangians.  They can be reinterpreted as Cohomological Hall invariants for a symmetric quiver determined by the framing, a phenomenon called ""framing duality.""  A second research direction is to count the number of nodal curves of genus-g in a g-dimensional family inside a toric surface.  The idea is to create a Beauville-type integrable system (curves and their Jacobians) and to use, in this novel setting, the reasoning employed by the PI and Yau to count curves on K3 surfaces, namely: find  the Euler characteristic of the total space.  Another viewpoint is to compute with tropical geometry.  This project is joint with Helge Ruddat.

However, achieving reliable and safe connected autonomous driving (CAD) is still very challenging. On one hand, the safety of the CAD system hinges critically on its timing correctness, as crucial driving decisions fully depend on the output of the real-time perception system. On the other hand, requesting information from other devices mayl create additional delays for the on-vehicle real-time perception tasks, and thus the timing correctness of the CAD system can be easily violated by unpredictable communications. This project seeks to bring predictable real-time computing to CAD systems, and the goal of the proposed research is to enable the connected autonomous vehicle and exterior devices to perform real-time perception tasks as a whole by (i) establishing a practical real-time task model to integrate exterior devices into the on-vehicle perception system, which can be implemented on the GPU-enabled computing platforms; (ii) proposing real-time task scheduling algorithms and associated timing validation analysis to guarantee that all the real-time perception tasks can complete at the right time; (iii) developing a prototype CAD system on the autonomous vehicle testbed, HydraOne, and the roadside unit, Equinox, to evaluate the real-time performance of the proposed solutions.<br/><br/>Building a CAD system will constitute a major technological breakthrough towards realizing fully autonomous vehicles. In particular, this project emphasizes both scheduling algorithm design and system implementation. The establishment of a real-time suspending-gang task model will enable the first-of-its-kind formalization for depicting the executing flow of real-time workloads executed between the autonomous vehicle and the exterior devices. The real-time task scheduler oversees the entire system and ensures its timing correctness. The creation of new real-time resource allocation methods together with the associated analysis for validating timing constraints will drive the scheduling theory towards real applications in future cyber-physical systems. The proposed research aims to realize the CAD system on the physical platforms (HydraOne/Equinox), with indoor and outdoor studies beyond simulation. Especially, HydraOne/Equinox are ready-to-use platforms that will allow experts/researchers to easily examine their research designs regarding autonomous driving. Educational efforts will be devoted to (i) develop the HydraOne Educational Toolkit for undergraduate education and research, (ii) curriculum design for hands-on learning in the BS/MS program, (iii) summer camp development for K-12 students and teachers, (iv) broadening participation in computing and engineering to enhance diversity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thompson of the University of Southern California is developing a new class of semiconducting polymers by decorating commodity plastics with electro-active segments.  Semiconducting polymers impact many areas of contemporary energy and electrical science.  These long chain carbon-based macromolecules are extensively used in solar cells, LED screens and other applications that utilize the conversion of electricity to light.  In this research, electro-active segments will be attached to main polymer backbone consisting of single carbon-carbon bonds with a specific alignment relative to one another.  Segments will be prepared that contain small organic molecules featuring carbon-nitrogen pi-bonds (double bonds).  When these pi-bonds are broken, they create positive and negative charges along the side chains of the main polymer backbone.  With such a chemical approach, non-metallic plastics are converted to plastics that conduct electricity and absorb light.  If successful, this work will fundamentally change the approach toward electro-active polymers with improved environmental stability and mechanical properties.  This work will provide an outstanding framework for the training of undergraduate and graduate students in polymer chemistry.  Outreach and educational activities will focus on participation in the USC-Cerritos Community College summer research internship program and implementation of writing-to-learn pedagogies in undergraduate organic chemistry courses. There is also broader impact through international collaboration with the collaborators in Germany adding a special dimension to the training experience for the students engaged in this research.  <br/><br/>This research will focus on development of semiconducting polymers based on non-conjugated (meth)acrylate backbones containing electronically active pendant groups.  In the first specific aim, the synthesis of homopolymers will be optimized using controlled radical and anionic polymerization methods, with the goal to identify the influence of critical aspects of polymer structure on charge transport with a central focus on the role of stereoregularity. Post-polymerization methods to incorporate electroactive pendants will utilize transesterification and thiol-ene addition reactions.  The second aim focuses on stereoregular block copolymers based on acrylate backbones. Lastly, the prepared multi-functional polymers will be explored for potential use in organic photovoltaics by evaluating the correlations between polymer structure and thin film morphology. The proposed research, if successful, will advance fundamental chemistry knowledge on how to use tacticity to assist in the arrangement of the electro-active pendants into an ordered conformation to facilitate and improve electron transport efficiency.  In the long run, this work could also enable the preparation of flexible, lightweight and inexpensive organic semiconductors with roll-to-roll processing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, there has been great effort to assemble colloids into new functional materials with designer architecture using electric and magnetic fields. Of particular interest are colloids that spin (rotors), because in such systems the flows stirred by the rotating particles add to the electrostatic interactions thereby vastly expanding the possible structures. This project will study the theory of dynamics of colloids placed between two planar electrodes in order to understand the mechanisms of the field-driven particle assembly. The project integrates knowledge across the fields of applied math, fluid mechanics and soft matter, which will be very beneficial for the training of the students associated with the project. Visually appealing experiments will help educate the public about mathematics and fluid dynamics.  <br/><br/>This proposal is concerned with a theoretical investigation of the dynamics of rotating colloids powered by the Quincke effect, which is the spontaneous spinning of a dielectric sphere in an applied uniform electric field. The Quincke rotor dynamics in free space is described by the Lorenz equations and the system has gathered attention as one of the physical realizations of Lorenz chaos: at high electric fields the sphere spins irregularly around a fixed axis. However, the dynamics of Quincke rotors in confinement is strikingly different than that in free space. An individual rotor displays three-dimensional motion with periodic reorientation of the axis of rotation. Collectives of hovering Quincke rotors are found to self-organize into stable clusters or snaking chains. This project will investigate the electrohydrodynamics of particles placed between two planar electrodes. The novel mathematical challenges are many and include analytical solutions of single particle dynamics near boundaries, careful consideration of pair-wise hydrodynamic and electrostatic interactions in confinement, and integration of these analytical results into a Stokesian-dynamics-based algorithm for a very large numbers of particles. Benchmark experiments to complement the mathematical research are proposed to justify and validate the mathematical models and to ensure that the research has impact both in and beyond the applied mathematics community. Educational impact includes bringing direct experimental experience in fluid dynamics and soft matter research to applied mathematics undergraduate and graduate students at Northwestern University. The emergent behavior of the Quincke rotors will likely open new research directions across various fields, e.g., non-equilibrium soft matter, materials engineering, and fluid dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ecosystem engineers therefore can be important drivers of local and regional diversity. Our own species ? humans ? offer a powerful example. Humans have adopted behaviors that have created, modified, and/or destroyed habitats used by a wide variety of animals and plants. The effects of these activities are leading to dramatic changes in the structure and function of ecosystems, and the current global biodiversity crisis that has been termed the ?6th mass extinction?. Thus, some consequences of human activities are comparable to the environmental perturbations associated with mass extinctions, whereas others may be creating new ecological opportunities. A key question is therefore: what effect will human ecosystem engineering behaviors have as we continue to modify the global environment? This Research Coordination Network will bring together ecologists and paleontologists to synthesize information on the effects of ecosystem engineers in different kinds of biological systems at different times to develop predictive models for how human activity is expected to affect ecosystems. The researchers will also conduct outreach activities designed to increase diversity in STEM fields using partnerships with local community colleges, an undergraduate course taught concurrently at member institutions, and a conference workshop.<br/><br/><br/>The key to predicting the effects our activities may lie in the past. Although humans are among the most recently emerged ecosystem engineers with powerful effects, they are not the first. The evolution of biological groups such as oxygenic photosynthesizing cyanobacteria, marine animals capable of burrowing beneath the sediment surface, a wide variety of reef-building organisms and land plants are all thought to have had dramatic effects on global biodiversity. This Research Coordination Network will synthesize existing data across nearly 600 million years of evolutionary history to address the questions: 1) to what extent are the effects of new ecosystem engineers on communities predictable? And, 2) to what extent do we expect humans to continue to drive the 6th mass extinction, and/or create new ecological and evolutionary opportunities? The E6 RCN will unite scientists from the fields of paleobiology, geology, ecology, statistics, conservation, and phylogenetics to contrast the ecological and evolutionary consequences of ecosystem engineers. Activities will include twice yearly workshops and training of graduate students, postdocs, and faculty. In partnership with the University of California Museum of Paleontology, researchers will develop and run a paleobotany and paleoclimatology lab for Bay Area community college students. An interdisciplinary course on Extinction and Ecosystem engineers will be taught concurrently at participant institutions, and a workshop on approaches for studying ecosystem engineers and community ecology at large spatial and temporal scales will be developed for national and international conferences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ali of Xavier University of Louisiana is studying the design and exploration of flavin induced allosteric aptamers with microRNA specific functional domains. Flavin mononucleotide (FMN) and flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD), are biologically active forms of riboflavin. These molecules play diverse and wide-ranging roles in a multitude of biological processes due to their structure and chemical versatility. The exploration of FAD and their interactions as ligands within allosteric nucleic acid probes will offer fundamental insight into their potential role as molecular switches, chemo-responsive sensors or genetic control elements. In addition to promoting discovery in nucleic acid chemistry and sensing fields, this project (both directly and indirectly-via Dr. Ali?s teaching responsibilities and outreach program) will also promote teaching, and learning of chemistry at the middle school through undergraduate level. <br/><br/>RNA polymers are well known for their ability to present a range of distinct structural conformations. These molecules lend themselves to the formation of allosteric nucleic acid scaffolds with multiple binding domains. Although ubiquitous in nature, the isolation of molecules with dual-domain functionality from a random sequence population is not facile. An approach to generating allosteric ribozymes is to utilize a mixture of modular rational design in combination with in-vitro selection strategies. To explore the utility of flavins as ligands, Dr. Ali is interested in using a combination of these existing efforts to design allosteric systems by using rational design to construct flavin dependent conformational switches, where flavin binding will lead to the formation of binding pockets using an aptamer scaffold with tailored miR binding regions. Such forms of ?adaptive-binding? have traditionally been used with RNA motifs to allosterically regulate the activity of naturally occurring catalytic RNA. Together, these systems provide novel approaches to chemo-responsive sensing, particularly novel methods of allosteric aptamer development.  Specifically, these studies are expected to contribute to the design of new flavin binding scaffolds for sensing microRNA.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indeed, tools from algebra can be used to study objects in topology, and vice versa. One illustration of this deep interaction is through algebraic K-theory. Algebraic K-theory is an invariant of rings, fundamental objects in algebra. There is great interest in algebraic K-theory due to its significant applications in the fields of algebraic geometry, number theory, and topology. While algebraic K-theory is difficult to compute, and many open questions remain, there is a powerful approach using tools from topology. In recent years, exciting advances in algebraic topology have made it possible to study questions in algebraic K-theory which were previously thought to be inaccessible. A goal of this project is to produce new algebraic K-theory computations. A key step in computing algebraic K-theory is studying a related invariant called topological Hochschild homology. Another goal of this project is to further develop the framework and theory around variants of topological Hochschild homology, and study applications to several other areas of mathematics. In addition to the mathematics research goals, the project also includes work in undergraduate and graduate education, undergraduate research, conference organization, and efforts to support the participation of women and other underrepresented groups in mathematics.  <br/><br/><br/>This project uses the tools of equivariant stable homotopy to study algebraic K-theory and topological Hochschild homology. Algebraic K-theory is an invariant of a ring which is generally very difficult to compute. A fruitful approach to the study of algebraic K-theory is the trace method approach, which approximates algebraic K-theory by theories that are more computable, such as topological Hochschild homology and topological cyclic homology. The trace method approach relies on tools from equivariant stable homotopy theory. This project explores the intricate relationship between equivariant homotopy theory, algebraic K-theory, and topological Hochschild homology. Specific research goals of the project are organized into three broad objectives: One, use recent developments in trace methods and equivariant stable homotopy theory to compute algebraic K-theory groups which were previously inaccessible. Two, use equivariant homotopy theory to study algebraic and topological Hochschild homologies such as twisted topological Hochschild homology and Real topological Hochschild homology. Three, study applications of topological Hochschild homology theories to questions in geometry and low-dimensional topology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, they are continuously threatened by the possibility of collisions between operational satellites and space debris, formed of all non-functional objects in orbit around the Earth. Robotic missions to dispose of large debris are currently being proposed to reduce the risk of such collisions. The objective of this research is to develop knowledge to put in practice autonomous cable-based de-tumbling of uncooperative space objects. Tether-net systems will be considered, which are thrown toward debris, entangle it or close around it, and provide a link to tug it to a disposal orbit. Focus of this research will be the modeling, analysis, and control of the chaser-net-target spacecraft system after capture, when the relative motion of the two satellites is particularly dangerous. Cable-based robots provide innovative solutions not only to applications such as debris capture and on-orbit servicing, but also asteroid deflection and drone interception. The advancements brought about by this research have the potential to positively impact national defense, increase the economic competitiveness of spacecraft solutions, and advance national prosperity. Activities to broaden participation in STEM will include research experiences for undergraduates, integration of research results in the curriculum, and outreach in underprivileged elementary schools.<br/><br/>The objective of this research will be attained by (1) high-fidelity modeling and analysis of the interactions between the cable-based robot and the target, and (2) control of the cable-based robot. In one thrust of the proposed work, high fidelity models will be developed to represent the dynamics of the cable-based robot as well as frictional interactions with the target. Reduced order but dynamically equivalent models will be created to provide an efficient but accurate alternative. A methodology to estimate the inertial parameters of the unknown, uncooperative target will also be proposed. The other research component aims to leverage the limited control authority of the cable-based robot to synthesize reliable and robust control methods. Options related to the winching of the main tether as well as to the thrusters of the chaser will be considered. Feedback control will be employed to stabilize at the same time the relative translational and attitude dynamics of the chaser and the target spacecraft. The robustness of the control to uncertainties will also be verified. These contributions are expected to enable important technological advancements of autonomous cable-based systems for space applications, while advancing the knowledge of nonlinear systems dynamics, model-based estimation, and control of complex nonlinear systems with limited authority.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important and overarching goal of spintronics is to discover and characterize more efficient means of generating spin currents and associated spin torques on magnetization. Recently it has been established that spin-orbit interactions enable very efficient charge-to-spin conversion and large torques on magnetic layers. However, the spin polarization that acts on the ferromagnetic layer is typically confined to the layer plane, and thus is very effective at reversing the magnetization of in-plane magnetized layers but far less effective in switching and exciting the magnetization of perpendicularly magnetized elements. This project investigates spin currents associated with spin-orbit coupling in ferromagnetic layers and their interfaces to nonmagnets, which have the potential to generate spin currents polarized perpendicular to the layer planes. The charge-to-spin conversion efficiency and the symmetry of the response are studied for a variety of transition metal materials and interfaces as a function of magnetization angle. Time-resolved and spatially resolved probes of magnetization dynamics are employed to reveal magnetization switching mechanisms in thin perpendicularly magnetized layers and patterned nanostructures to further the understanding of the nonlinear magnetization dynamics excited by spin-transfer torques. Graduate and undergraduate students involved in this collaboration will gain by interactions between academia and industry and through student exchanges between NYU and IBM. Their education will be enriched through the variety of perspectives, expertise and techniques present in an industrial setting. High school students will also be encouraged to participate in this research project. As part of this project the PIs will develop a new course at NYU on Physics and Technology with the goal of introducing students to physics in the ?real world? (outside of universities). The course will highlight the skills needed to apply physics to commercialize technologies and impact society more broadly in technological fields, including in magnetism and quantum information.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research aims to gain a better understanding of the factors that will lead to specific interactions with different carbohydrates in order to provide guiding principles for future design of sugar receptors and sensors.  This collaborative project integrates experiments with theoretical studies and provides a great platform for research training of undergraduate and graduate students, including students of underrepresented groups.

The oligoamides fold into helical coil structures with multiple hydrogen bond acceptors being directed toward the nanosized hollow core.  When embedded in a lipid bilayer membrane in aqueous solution, the helical coils stack to create channels through which ions and small molecules flow from one side of the membrane to the other side.  With the numerous H-bonding sites, different sugars and sugar alcohols are expected to interact with the inner pore of the helical coil with different affinities.  Such interaction, being dynamic and transient, especially in water, will perturb the ion currents through the transmembrane pores. This research team will (1) optimize the synthesis of the oligoamides, (2) perform one- and two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopic studies and X-ray crystallographic structural analysis to interrogate the interactions between the host and specific carbohydrates to include monosaccharides, disaccharides, and higher oligosaccharides; (3) examine the effects of various carbohydrate guests on the transmembrane ion currents through the helical pores; and (4) carry out computational studies to optimize host-guest binding and to probe the effect carbohydrate guests have on transmembrane ion flows through the helical pores.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These traits determine how individuals interact with their environment (ecology) which then influences the course of evolution. Thus, ecology and evolution are inextricably intertwined. Bridging the fields of evolution and ecology is challenging because the processes involved can operate on similar, or very different, time scales. African savanna acacia trees have evolved to survive and reproduce under harsh conditions not tolerated by many other tree species. Acacias can tolerate fires, droughts, herbivory by giraffes and elephants, and competition from other plants. But how acacias have adapted to these conditions in the past will influence their response to the current changing environment on the African continent. The goal of this study is to develop a comprehensive understanding of the evolutionary history and ecological distribution of African acacias and to explore how species traits and distributions changed over time in response to change in the savanna climate. Ultimately, this knowledge will inform predictions about how acacia habitats will be affected by ongoing climate change. This project not only has broader societal benefit but also it will train undergraduate and graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in evolutionary biology, ecology, plant physiology, and molecular genomics. In addition, the project will expand the content and reach of a successful undergraduate teaching module of ecology and evolution featuring Serengeti National Park and will begin a new bioinformatics training course in partnership with universities in Africa.<br/><br/>This project will bridge phylogenetic approaches to diversification with direct ecological field measurement of trait responses and gene expression. The activities include: (1) constructing new, detailed models of the phylogenetic history and ecological distribution of species and traits in the African Acacia Clade, (2) using phylogenomic analyses to study selection, introgression, and gene family expansion in relation to the Savanna Syndrome, (3) measuring acacia trait responses to Savanna Syndrome components (drought, fire, herbivory, grass competition) in a common garden experiment in Arusha, Tanzania, and (4) analyzing the molecular aspects of the phenotypic response through analysis of acacia transcriptomic profiles collected both on site in Tanzania and in controlled greenhouse experiments. Collectively, these linked lines of evidence will provide crucial information about the past evolution of the savanna community, the rapid rise of savannas across Africa that occurred in the Miocene, and its likely response to present ecological change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The program will contribute to improving the efficiency of agricultural water management through performance evaluation of current water resource management projects, identifying critical bottlenecks and opportunities, and proposing appropriate solutions. The program will use the food-energy-water-livelihood nexus approach, which is the state-of-the-art approach for water resource management that takes into account the co-benefits and tradeoffs in managing interconnected resources (land, water, and energy). The program will train U.S. students in multidisciplinary and community-based research in water resources, agriculture and climate, and help advance their understanding of agricultural water management issues in developing countries. U.S. students, mentored by international researchers, will undertake practical student-led projects in Gezira Irrigation Project (Sudan), Nyanza-23 Irrigation Project (Rwanda), and Meila & Haiba Irrigation Projects (Ethiopia). Students will be trained in all aspects of research (from proposal preparation, to implementation, and communication), and involved in co-academic activities, such as, social activities with local communities and stakeholders, and visits to key cultural, touristic, and educational sites.<br/><br/>U.S. students will study water resource management issues in the Eastern Nile Basin countries from the food-energy-water-livelihood nexus perspective, using irrigation projects as case studies. The proposed research examines the linkages, trade-offs, and co-benefits among the nexus components, and propose nexus-based solutions to improve agricultural water resource management. The program represents a partnership between University of California Los Angeles (UCLA), Hydraulic Research Center in Sudan, University of Rwanda, and Mekelle University. Over three years, a total of 18 students (12 undergraduates and 6 graduates) from U.S. institutions, including underrepresented colleges and universities, will participate in one-year of training structured around an 8-week Summer research in Sudan (year 1), Rwanda (year 2), and Ethiopia (year 3), with Spring preparation and Fall follow up. During Spring, students will enroll in a seminar course jointly delivered by the participating faculty mentors. During Summer, students will go to East Africa for eight weeks to undertake student-led projects. Examples of student projects include: understanding the dynamics between water supply and demand, characterizing water footprint and productivity, quantifying the impact of access to irrigation water on irrigator?s food and livelihood security, assessing water quality and sedimentation, and developing pilot crowdsourcing project for data collection and dissemination. During Fall, students will continue to do their research culminating in undergraduate senior/Honors thesis or Master?s thesis. Then, students will present their research work at an international scientific conference, such as, American Geophysical Union (AGU) Fall Meeting. The intellectual merit of this work lies in the integration of field data, remote sensing, and modeling to understand relationships between the food, energy, water, and livelihood nexus components. The project specifically addresses the following science questions: (1) What are the nexus hotspots and key interactions in the social and ecological dynamics of food, water, and livelihood systems at multiple scales and levels? (2) In what ways can we extend methodologies traditionally used to analyze water resource systems to nexus systems? (3) What nexus-based solutions (technological, management, governance, and marketing) are needed to improve current water productivity and to guide future new developments? Results will be disseminated through pilot crowdsourcing project, policy briefs, scientific presentations in the USA and Eastern Nile basin countries, and peer-reviewed publications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We include a contingency plan for possible travel restrictions. The overarching theme of students' research projects is to enable a massively inverter-based electric power system while addressing their control, communication, and cybersecurity requirements and challenges. As the power system transitions to include a larger share of renewables and inverter-based generation, it challenges conventional stability and control concepts. Simultaneously, the electric power grid's growing dependency on information and communication technology (ICT) significantly increases its vulnerability to network unavailability and security issues. Therefore, ensuring timely and secure delivery of data is central to guaranteeing the performance of control, optimization, and supervisory systems. This work is expected to contribute to (i) algorithms to study the feasibility of interconnection of renewables to the power system, (ii) control and design of power systems, microgrids, and inverters in 100% renewables setting, and (iii) inverter and microgrid cybersecurity under communication-enabled strategies. This is an area in which the U.S. PIs and French collaborators have complementary expertise. Under Grenoble mentorship, the U.S. students work on these research challenges. Students' exposure to these problems, especially in a European context, is expected to help them think of innovative solutions to the similar challenges in the United States. Additionally, G2Elab has active collaborations with several industry partners, which facilitates industry tours and field trips.

This proposal addresses the hypothesis that during rapid warming events, defined as several C of warming per century, Northern Hemisphere mid-latitude net summer precipitation decreases, and winter precipitation increases, regardless of boundary conditions. This hypothesis is based on future scenarios for climate in this region, but these forecasts have large uncertainties. The researcher will test the hypothesis and fill one of these gaps by vetting and applying an approach that uses biomarkers and stable isotopes of Hydrogen in lake sediments to reconstruct temperature, precipitation seasonality, and net summer precipitation in the Laurentian Great Lakes region. The resulting high-resolution records will span the three largest warming events in the past 15,000 years, each of which occurred under different boundary conditions, and the most recent 500 years. This research will further test the hypothesis throughout the Northern Hemisphere mid-latitudes using a paleoclimate database spanning the past 15,000 years, which will be improved and expanded as part of the project.<br/><br/>The research will be integrated into an education program (course and summer internship) that prepares diverse undergraduate and graduate students (University at Buffalo, NY) for Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) careers by training them to understand and communicate climate science in socio-culturally relevant contexts and to solve complex problems. The course and internship focus on a real-world project in which students partner with local businesses and use scientific research as the basis to develop carbon footprints and strategic climate action plans for these businesses.

The framework developed for businesses will be made publicly available and disseminated through regional business networks.

While in residence, the students will work closely with the faculty, postdoctoral associates, and graduate students in the research groups of Professors Magnus Sjalander and Magnus Jahre who are affiliated with the Computer Architecture Laboratory (CAL) at NTNU.  The participating FSU and MTU students will not only increase their research knowledge, but will also become more globally engaged and better prepared to work in a culturally diverse, international environment. <br/><br/>The era of improving processor performance without innovations in computer architecture or compilers is over since increasing the clock rate for computers has not been possible in recent years due to thermal limitations.  However, manually modifying programs to efficiently exploit computer architectures is time consuming, error prone, and not portable to other systems.  The most effective way to improve application performance is to automatically exploit architectural features without the intervention of the application developers.  Our focus will be on automatically achieving high performance and energy efficiency by generating code to exploit existing and proposed architectural features at the machine instruction level.  We propose to develop the compilation tools to facilitate the process of automatically generating code to exploit <br/>these proposed architectural features and to develop the simulation tools to evaluate the impact on both performance and energy efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Control over electrochemical parameters allows for tunable programming of both composition and structure. In addition, the synthesis of two-dimensional materials at liquid metal interfaces under electrochemical control is being explored for the development of an alternative synthetic toolbox for synthesizing intermetallic nanostructures.

Two key developments are being targeted. First, the ec-LLS method is being explored for the synthesis of two-dimensional Pb crystals (e.g. plumbene) through characterization by X-ray reflectivity. Second, in-situ liquid electrochemical transmission electron microscopy is employed to record individual intermetallic nanoparticle growth events by ec-LLS. Researchers involved in this work are trained in electrochemistry, materials, metallurgy, nanoscience, solid-state chemistry, X-ray reflectivity, and transmission electron microscopy.

To better understand such systems, much attention has been paid to how, for example in a bacterial colony, the boundary of the  region occupied by the colony changes over time. Kardar, Parisi, and Zhang (KPZ) proposed that a stochastic partial differential equation could be used to describe the evolution of these boundaries. This project will study a large class of systems that are believed to be governed by this equation, with the goal of verifying that the time evolution is well-described by this probabilistic model. The project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The KPZ universality class is a collection of models of random growth in the plane that all exhibit the same asymptotic behavior. Over the last two decades there has been great progress understanding exactly solvable (algebraic) models like exponential last-passage percolation and the longest increasing subsequence in a uniformly random permutation. This project will study first-passage percolation. This is a class of models which are believed to be in the KPZ universality class and have the same asymptotic properties as the models mentioned above. But without the algebraic tools of the exactly solvable models, they have proven very difficult to analyze.

The project will research and develop an innovative mixed reality (MR) learning environment combining visual displays and a robot with programmable movement. Children in grades K-2 will program the robot to solve path-finding problems. Hints and obstacles in each problem scenario will be presented on a computer tablet. The project environment will be designed mainly for one-on-one use wirelessly and flexibly in either formal or informal settings. Participating children and teachers will be recruited through partnerships with schools in communities that have traditionally been underrepresented in STEM. <br/><br/>The project design will be grounded in research on embodied cognition, culturally responsive teaching, child development, and human-computer interaction, to develop experiential, inclusive, and playful learning experiences. Three main research questions include 1) what design elements are critical for an effective MR environment? 2) how do children?s positive affect and understanding of sequences and symbols evolve as they participate in the task over time? and 3) what do teachers need to succeed as facilitators? To promote computational thinking skills, children will be engaged in path-finding tasks that will require them to guide a robot to arrive at a destination through the right path. The design of the learning environment and the research will be interwoven in an iterative cycle of design, testing, and development. in addition to traditional data collection methods, sensors will be employed for collection of children?s own movement data. The effectiveness of the environment on learners' understanding and positive affect will be examined by comparing the intervention group with a control group.

One type of chemical can produce Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS), which are forms of oxygen that damage cells. Animals respond to ROS by escaping and producing molecules that degrade ROS as a defense mechanism. Laboratory experiments typically focus on analyzing animal responses to a single chemical, but realistic scenarios involve mixtures of multiple chemicals. Observed effects due to manipulating a single chemical could be heightened or silenced when mixtures of chemicals are considered. This project focuses on understanding how animals respond to mixtures of chemicals that produce ROS using nematodes as a model organism. Key questions include how different responses in the organism change with time, and whether the nervous system is important in generating such responses. Understanding whether different conditions and chemical mixtures result in different responses also is a key objective. This work will build understanding about how animals respond to environmental chemicals in realistic scenarios, which is important to understand the effects of such exposures on the health of humans and other species. This project also serves to develop several tools useful for the broader scientific community, such as tools for measuring escape responses in nematodes and the generation of defense enzymes. In addition, this project includes training of a diverse workforce in the biological sciences as it interfaces with data science and statistics. Finally, the outreach program associated with the project focuses on engaging with high school students from under-represented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>Different types of noxious environments can drive the stress response and act through closely associated genetic pathways. Most studies focus on exposure to single stressors and measure responses from a single organismal readout. Yet, realistic environmental exposures consist of complex mixtures through long periods of time. How multiple stressors interact to drive the stress response in a time-dependent manner, and how diverse responses from different cells and tissues orchestrate the organismal response is not fully understood. A challenge to address these questions is the need to acquire responses from multiple levels of the organism, and to perform a broad range of combinatorial exposures that can probe a wide organismal stress response space. This work uses the model organism C. elegans to answer: 1. Whether oxidants and other stressors exhibit interacting effects on the stress response; and 2. Whether oxidant detection plays a role in the organismal oxidative stress response, and if so, whether neuronal and transcriptional programs operate in different contexts and time scales.  This work determines whether different response modalities are elicited by different exposures, involves measurement of responses from multiple biological units (neuron signaling, transcription factor activity, and antioxidant enzyme gene expression) with tissue specificity, and includes development of data-driven models to identify functional relationships between different stress-response signals in the organism. A large focus of this work is on assessing the responses to combinations of chemical mixtures, and on studying the dynamics of the organismal responses. The project goals are achieved through integration of several complementary approaches, including microfluidics, fluorescence imaging, optogenetics, neuronal silencing, and statistical modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The rapid progress of QIS has also had profound impacts on the rest of physics. From high-energy physics to condensed matter theory, ideas, techniques, and conceptual frameworks developed in this field have had revolutionary effects. In this project, the Principal Investigator will address a series of related QIS questions of critical importance to both theoretical physics and quantum computing.  Broadly speaking, this project aims to investigate the behavior and properties of composite quantum-mechanical systems in the presence of symmetries and conservation laws.  Besides applications in QIS, the project also explores the implications of this study in other areas of Physics.  Specifically, the project investigates how quantum phenomena can enhance or affect the performance of thermal machines.  This project also provides educational opportunities for a range of students in physics, engineering, and other computational sciences.   <br/><br/>The project consists of two main parts:  The first part fully investigates the properties and applications of Local Symmetric Quantum Circuits  (LSQC) and, specifically, random LSQC. The problem of characterizing LSQC is equivalent to determining the general features of the unitary time evolutions generated by local symmetric Hamiltonians. This is useful, e.g., for understanding chaos and thermalization of many-body systems with conserved charges. Although certain aspects of LSQC have been previously studied in the context of quantum chaos and Symmetry-Protected Topological (SPT) order, a broad and precise understanding of the properties of this family of circuits is still missing. A preliminary study has revealed unexpected features and the rich mathematical structure of this framework. The anticipated results have applications and implications in areas such as quantum control, quantum thermodynamics, SPT order, and quantum gravity.  The second part of this project investigates quantum thermodynamics from the point of view of quantum information theory, and more specifically, the resource-theoretic approach to thermodynamics, which has been flourishing in the last ten years. The project aims to address some important shortcomings of the existing framework, namely to develop a unified theory of work and coherence distillation in the resource-theoretic framework of quantum thermodynamics, as well as experimental proposals for probing genuine quantum features of this theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This virus, similar to many others, is nearly spherical in shape with a core of protein-nucleic acid complex surrounded by an envelope of a protein-decorated lipid bilayer. After landing on the respiratory tract surface, viruses need to navigate through a dense, viscous, and heterogeneous mucus network, which is under constant beating of cilia that try to clear the trapped virus away. This experimental project will use soft, patchy nanoparticles as virions, gel-forming mucin molecules as the mucus barrier, and a shear flow as the beating of cilia. The model system will capture the pertinent underlying physics and generate reproducible results that will reveal how transport across mucus layers is affected by the softness of the particles, particle interactions with the model mucus molecules and fluctuations in the state of the model mucus molecular network. The research will lead to a better understanding of how air-borne viruses interact with the mucus membrane, which will help fight against diseases. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained in an interdisciplinary field that will  prepare them to explore a wide range of career opportunities. Middle and high school students will be trained to participate in STEM competitions with the research team serving as a coach for the Science Olympiad Tournaments.  <br/><br/>The objective of the project is to investigate the transport behavior of soft patchy nanoparticles (NPs) through mucin gels and solutions subjected to constant sliding velocity.

Droplet-liquid impacts are fundamental to a range of industrial, agricultural, advanced manufacturing, environmental, and aerospace applications.  As a droplet impinges on a liquid layer, several distinct outcomes are possible, which include complete rebound (bouncing), merging (deposition), and splashing.  Depending on the target area of interest, each of these three distinct outcomes can be either desirable or undesirable.  Broadening our current understanding of droplet impact phenomena to include three-dimensional effects is of critical and timely importance to unlocking and advancing real-world applications. This research program makes use of slow-motion photography and cutting-edge computer simulations.  Collaborators at the University of Oxford and the University of Warwick will carry out the high-energy impact experiments and direct numerical simulations over all regimes of interest, respectively.  Partners from the inkjet printing and aerospace industries are engaged in this project, ensuring a direct and accelerated track for knowledge transfer.

Chemists and material scientists have made great stride in molecular photovoltaics using so called dye-sensitized solar cells. The key molecules for the initial capture of solar energy are all based on rare precious metals such as Ru and Ir. Hence, it is highly desirable to develop molecules of similar capturing capability but based on earth abundant metals such as Cr, Fe and Co. However, most of compounds based on earth abundant metals lose the captured solar energy (so called excited state) before converting it into electricity.  Professor Ren and his coworkers will extend the lifetime of excited states by using a new family of macrocycles to support Fe and Co containing molecules, and hence improve the conversion efficiency of solar energy to electricity. Professor Ren will work with a group of graduate and undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds. Through Purdue Science Express, he and his students will strive to improve the high school STEM education in the rural areas in Indiana through sharing laboratory equipment sets and designing new laboratory curriculum.<br/><br/>The chemistry of metal alkynyls is a vibrant and evolving field, on which important technological advances including photovoltaics, photo-catalysis and molecular electronic devices have been achieved. This project will seek to develop unsymmetric bis-alkynyl complexes with long lived charge separated excited states based on the combination of earth abundant 3d metals and unsaturated [14]-tetraene-N4 macrocycles. The initial effort will be directed at the identification/preparation of suitable M([14]-tetraene-N4) starting materials, where M is Co(III) or Fe(III) and L is one of the three [14]-tetraene-N4 macrocycles, HMTI, TIM and TMTI. The ensuing effort will be focused on both the development of high yield preparation of the D-B-A dyads, and the understanding of donor/acceptor properties through voltammetry, steady state emission spectroscopy and ground state DFT calculations. The later phase of the project will be focused on the dynamics of the excited states. Through collaborations, significant aspects include the temporal and spatial evolution of the MLCT states in [M(II)( [14]-tetraene-N4)] complexes will be studied using fs M-edge XANES technique and companion high level CASSCF/CASPT2 analysis; and the dynamics of photo-induced electron transfer with the D-B-A dyad using both pump-probe and time-resolved IR techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This means that while these media look very different from each other, waves propagating in each of them tend to display similar, characteristic behaviors.  This includes the development of rapid oscillations known as dispersive shock waves, long-lasting propagating pulses known as solitons, and isolated, high-amplitude disturbances known as rogue waves.  The mathematical models used to understand and describe these phenomena are similar, regardless of the media being studied.  It is a major challenge to construct a cohesive mathematical framework general enough to capture common features across different models yet flexible enough to reveal details in specific situations.  Drawing on the most up-to-date analytical, asymptotic, and numerical methods, the project will develop enhanced models of dispersive phenomena including shock waves, solitons, and rogue waves, with applications to areas including hydrodynamics, meteorology, and optical communications.  The training and professional development of graduate students, undergraduate students, and postdoctoral researchers will be integral to all aspects of the work.<br/><br/>The three major objectives of the project are as follows.  (1) Derive a mathematical description of the basic dispersive structure, the oscillatory shock, that is robust enough to handle both shocks that decay and those that break up into trains of solitons in the KdV equation and related models.  (2) Develop computationally feasible methods for computing, with error estimates, global phenomena such as the interaction of multiple dispersive shock waves in the NLS equation and related models.  (3) Establish a new, universal theory of high-amplitude rogue waves applicable to the NLS, sine-Gordon, and Ablowitz-Ladik equations, among others.

The water and solutes from each streamtube interact as they come together, simplifying the watershed geometry into a tree without sacrificing process-level realism. The streamtube approach will also enforce velocity correlations, which is a novel feature at watershed scales that is lacking in previous models despite evidence that persistent correlations exist.

CRUX promotes underutilized high-quality material science data by allowing the sharing and exploration of unpublished data with state-of-the-art crowdsourcing, knowledge harvesting, and machine learning techniques. CRUX provides a crowdsourced knowledge base to allow scientists and the general public to share and access unpublished data resources. It also provides (a) a novel search engine that supports simple keyword search, can provide relevant data resources when the exact keyword matching does not exist, and self-evolves to improve the search quality, and (b) a ""data feed"" service to allow users to easily receive and track updates of specific data resources of interest. The developed infrastructure and tools enable an open, collaborative, and sustainable platform that can facilitate exchanging of unpublished XRD data and discoveries, unlock new research problems (e.g., predictive analysis of materials compositions with multi-phase data), and inspire the novel design of machine learning pipelines (e.g., deep neural networks) for data-driven materials science. CRUX will make materials data resources available and shareable for a broad community including materials scientists, data analysts, software developers, and the general public, and thus promote long-term collaborative research, software development, and education. <br/><br/>The developed CRUX system enables (1) coherent representation of materials data, metadata, and knowledge in terms of a three-tier knowledge graph model; (2) scalable XRD metadata curation and information extraction techniques to promote high-value unpublished XRD data sources for data-driven materials research; (3) adaptive, self-improving search and recommendation techniques to recommend relevant datasets upon user requests and feedback, with sustainability beyond the time of the project; and (4) interactive and exploratory search techniques to explain and recommend the relevant datasets beyond the scope of initial queries.

They can be utilized in applications such as non-volatile memories and enable spin-based electronics with applications such as quantum computing. However, most semiconductors are non-magnetic. There has been some success in making magnetic semiconductors through doping conventional semiconductors with magnetic impurities. Usually only low magnetic transition temperatures have been achieved, limiting potential applications. This project will investigate two-dimensional (2D) magnetic semiconductors that have the potential to reach room temperature magnetism. 2D materials are extended in a plane but are only a few atoms thick. Such planar materials have potential for future devices because two-dimensional crystals can be stacked with atomically sharp interfaces. 2D materials are also sensitive to their environment and thus their properties can be tuned through interfaces or external stimuli. In this research the fundamental properties of magnetic dopants in 2D materials will be investigated in order to gain insight on the mechanisms that allow introduction and tuning of magnetism in these materials. The ultimate goal is to develop reliable approaches to realize 2D magnetic semiconductors that function above room temperature. The research has the potential to lead to the development of tunable spintronic devices based on new multifunctional materials. Importantly, this project provides training for graduate students in contemporary materials science with technological relevance and will broaden their experience through international collaborations and research activities.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>This project explores magnetic dopants in the 2D-semiconductors MoS2 and WSe2. Doped films and monolayers will be grown by low temperature-molecular beam epitaxy to enable the efficient incorporation of various transition metal dopants. The successful doping and the atomic scale dopant-structures will be  investigated by scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy to gain insight on the dopant induced defect states that control the local magnetic moments. The role of dopant-element, structure, and concentration on the magnetic properties is investigated by systematically varying materials processing conditions and investigation of the magnetic properties by magnetometry and synchrotron x-ray magnetic circular dichroism studies. The experimental observations are correlated to theoretical density functional calculations. Tunability of the magnetic properties by charge transfer doping in ultrathin films is also studied. This study will give insight on the magnetic coupling mechanism of the dopants and the role of secondary defects in tuning of the magnetism. The study exploits the 2D nature of the material systems for both gaining better insight in the general mechanism for diluted magnetic semiconductors, as well as for the potential of exploiting their atomically sharp interfaces in van der Waals heterostructures for combining magnetic materials with materials with diverse quantum properties as well as for magnetic device structures. Fundamentally, this activity aims at determining the magnetic coupling between magnetic dopants to find the reason for the apparently higher Curie temperatures in 2D magnetic diluted semiconductors compared to traditional semiconductors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is well-know that ice melts to form water when the temperature reaches 32 degrees Fahrenheit, or 0 degrees Celsius. However, this is not always the case. Nanoparticles, which are about a million times smaller than the period at the end of this sentence, can change this transition temperature. When embedded in ice, a thin layer often forms near the nanoparticle surface that can melt below normal temperatures. Working with his students, Professor Dragnea uses a photothermal microscopy technique to observe the melting of this thin ice layer when the nanoparticle is rapidly heated by a laser. Their discoveries could have implications for understanding a variety of environmental processes such as ice crystal formation in the atmosphere, as well as provide ways of controlling friction and adhesion on icy surfaces.

The nanoparticle is then heated by laser excitation, raising the temperature of the surrounding solid. The formation of the QLL is detected by measuring the light scattered by the nanoparticle at various temperatures. The measurement is facilitated by modulation of the interfacial liquid thickness through repeated absorption of laser pulses by the nanoparticle. In addition to characterizing the convex surfaces of spherical nanoparticles, the formation of the QLL near concave surfaces of shape-controlled nanoparticles is also studied.

All STEM disciplines use graphs to display, interpret, and analyze data. With today?s data analysis and visualization tools, graphing skills are even more crucial as the public gains greater access to databases and dissemination platforms that can widely share both accurate and flawed graphs. Graphing is particularly difficult in biology, where a wide range of topics leads to many different graphic contexts and where the data tend to be noisy.  Currently, educators do not understand the various paths students take in learning to graph biological data or how those paths may differ based on a student?s background.  Also not yet understood are the types of instructional interventions that could help students develop graphing expertise. This project will generate information to answer each of these questions. Specifically, the project will adapt, develop, and refine instructional tools for teaching graphing in a biology context. The project will involve instructors from diverse institutions that have introductory biology courses that enroll large numbers of students from different demographic backgrounds. Using a graph construction tool called GraphSmarts, the researchers can examine student performance on different graphing tasks to reveal strategies students use to improve their graphing-related abilities. <br/> <br/>This project builds upon and expands on previous work examining the graphing practices of undergraduate students using a lobster-kelp scenario in the GraphSmarts tool. The project will develop four new scenarios for introductory biology graphing assessments.  These scenarios will focus on topics in physiology, cell biology, and ecology. Instructors from different institutional types across the United States will participate in a Faculty Mentoring Network to design new assessments that share context-independent attributes with the original lobster-kelp scenario. Using backward design strategies, the instructors will develop activities to teach the new scenarios in their introductory biology courses. Then, using the GraphSmarts tool, data on student performance will be collected to measure student learning and to validate the new graphing assessments. As students explore the new scenarios, the project will gather qualitative and quantitative data including student graphs and answers to questions. The information gathered from the newly designed assessments will provide educators with a more nuanced understanding of student graphing competencies. The results will help educators across STEM fields understand barriers that students face in understanding graphing, as well as potential solutions to those barriers. The project will produce open-access materials that will be shared on the high used QUBE network.

UB is a small protein mediating protein interaction for the regulation of various cellular processes, including those carried out by mitochondria. Mitochondria are ?powerhouses? in the cell for energy production, but at the same time, they are ?heavy polluters? that release reactive oxygen species (ROS) into their local environments, which inflicts damage on cells. During the process of aging, cells are less capable of managing ROS produced by mitochondria, and the accumulated damage could result in brain damage and heart failure at the end of the human life span. For self-protection, cells initiate a process called mitophagy with enzymes such as E3 UB ligases, where flagging the damaged mitochondria with UB takes place so damaged mitochondria can be isolated and removed before they release a substantial amount of damaging ROS in the cell. The joint teams of Yin and Cropp will assemble an integrated technology platform with a combined use of protein engineering, reactivity-based chemical probe design, and protein analysis methods to elucidate the mechanisms of mitophagy regulation that result from protein modification by UB. Their work will define the cellular steps underpinning ROS response and reveal how the breakdown of such processes may contribute to human aging. The integrated outreach program of the project will provide substantial training opportunities to K-12 students from local communities in Atlanta, GA and Richmond, VA. The highly diverse student body in the urban areas of the two cities will benefit from early exposure to the development of science and technology and the rewarding career opportunities in chemically driven biological research. <br/><br/>Protein modification by UB plays an essential role in sensing damaged mitochondria and signaling their removal by mitophagy. Various E3 UB ligases have been found to be recruited to damaged mitochondria and decorate them with UB chains to induce mitophagy. Currently, the ubiquitination targets of the E3s are not well characterized, so the E3-regulaued mitophagy pathways are undefined. Furthermore, E3s can assemble a network of UB chains of diverse linkages around damaged mitochondria, but little is known about how the UB chains are trimmed and edited by deubiquitinating enzymes (DUBs) to counteract the UB chain extension reaction catalyzed by the E3s. The joint team from the Yin and Cropp laboratories plans to fill these knowledge gaps by profiling the substrates of various E3s at the initiation phase of mitophagy with an innovative proteomic platform known as orthogonal UB transfer (OUT). OUT will enable the identification of the direct substrates of the E3s to map the associated cell signaling pathways regulating mitophagy. By comparing the substrate profiles of various E3s, the team will differentiate the roles of E3s in mitophagy regulation. Furthermore, the team has developed an innovative method to synthesize linkage-specific UB chains and UB-substrate conjugates based on unnatural amino acid (UAA) incorporation and plans to use the UB conjugates as probes to capture DUBs that regulate mitophagy. By accomplishing the research plan, the team expects to map the protein ubiquitination pathways regulating mitophagy and identify DUBs interacting with the E3s in editing diverse linkages of UB chains for proper encoding of the mitophagy signals. The significance of the work is to develop powerful technologies to map cell signaling pathways mediated by UB transfer, elucidate the actions of E3s and DUBs in mitophagy signaling, and decipher the cellular mechanisms underlying mitochondria quality control to neutralize the damage by ROS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Broadly defined, problem solving involves the mathematical practices in which students engage as they solve intellectually-challenging mathematical tasks. In prior research, problem-solving measures aligned to CCSSM for grades 3-5 were developed and validated to supplement previously established problem-solving measures in grades 6-8. The problem-solving measures assess students? problem-solving performance within the context of CCSSM math content and practices. This project expands the scope of the problem-solving measures use and score interpretation. The project work advances mathematical problem-solving assessments into computer adaptive testing. Computer adaptive testing allows for more precise and efficient targeting of student ability compared to static tests. Few measures designed to assess students? mathematical problem-solving ability use this technology. Shorter tests require less in-class time for assessment than current paper-pencil problem-solving measures and increase classroom instruction time. The computer-adaptive problem-solving measures have sufficient reliability and strong validity evidence, and may limit test-taker fatigue. Finally, the project will benchmark current grades 6-8 instruments using an objective standard-setting method, which allows for improved score interpretations with content-related feedback. Immediate results of student- and class-level reports will be produced through the computer adaptive testing system allowing for teachers to modify instruction to improve students? learning.<br/><br/>This five-year project aims to advance the use of computer adaptive testing and assessment development for use in mathematics instruction. The project applies an iterative and stakeholder-informed design science-based methodology as well as employs the use of Rasch modeling for the psychometric analysis during item development and validation. The project aims to: (a) benchmark the previously established grades 6-8 problem-solving measures; (b) develop, calibrate, and validate criterion-referenced computer adaptive testing for each measure; (c) construct student- and class-level score reports for integration into the computer adaptive testing system; and (d) investigate teachers? capacity for implementing, interpreting, and using the assessments and results in STEM learning settings. The project addresses the following set of research questions: (RQ1) What benchmark performance standards define different proficiency levels on problem-solving measures for each grade level? (RQ2) What are the psychometric properties of new problem-solving measures items developed for the computer adaptive testing item bank? (RQ3) Is there significant item drift across student populations on the new problem-solving measure items? (RQ4) To what extent are problem-solving measures item calibrations stable within the computer adaptive testing system? (RQ5) What recommendations for improvements do teachers and students have for the new problem-solving measures items, computer adaptive testing platform and reporting system, if any? (RQ6) To what extent do teachers interact with, perceive, and make sense of the assessment information generated for use in practice? and (RQ7) Does an online learning module build teacher capacity for problem solving measures, computer adaptive testing implementation, interpretation, and use of student assessment outcomes in STEM learning settings? An experimental design will be utilized to investigate teachers? capacity for implementing, interpreting, and using problem solving measures in a computer adaptive testing system. The project has the potential to impact the field by providing school districts and researchers a means to assess students? mathematical problem-solving performance at one time or growth over time efficiently and effectively; address future online learning needs; and improve classroom teaching through more precise information about students? strengths with less class time focused on assessment.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Decades of research have demonstrated that the quality and quantity of interactions between teachers and students can have a major impact on student engagement, attitudes toward learning, and downstream academic and socio-emotional outcomes. Despite the progress that has been made in studying classroom interactions and their impact on students' learning, as well as in developing effective interventions to help teachers teach better, the status quo of educational measurement is currently a significant roadblock to further progress in both educational research and teacher training. Specific problems with contemporary methods include ignoring the possibly different classroom experiences of individual students and minority subgroups, and providing only limited actionable feedback for teachers. This project will depart from standard observation protocols, which typically describe the ""average"" classroom experience of the ""average"" learner, and instead focus on characterizing over time the fine-grained experiences of every student in the classroom. The scientific instruments developed during this project will also be used to help teachers to identify potential biases when interacting with particular students in their classes.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, the team will make advances in multi-modal (vision, speech, natural language) machine learning to devise new architectures that analyze videos of school classrooms and perceive fine-grained interactions. The envisioned AI systems will (1) identify who is interacting with whom, when, and how in a school classroom; (2) find the key events during a teaching session that are most important for teacher feedback; and (3) summarize interactions for each student along different dimensions to find students who need more attention and to uncover possible bias. Based on these new analyses, the team will develop (4) predictive models to estimate socioemotional and academic outcomes outcomes. Finally, the team will (5) devise new teacher training experiences that help teachers to perceive classroom dynamics more accurately. The project will result in contributions to the fields of computer vision, speech analysis, machine learning, and education, and will offer new insights into automatic speaker diarization, person tracking, sentiment analysis, and classroom observation analysis. The scientific and educational agendas provide opportunities for inter-disciplinary training of research assistants; they will also enable and benefit from collaboration between the research team and teachers in both Massachusetts and Virginia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project develops novel and robust analytical techniques for models that share similar nonlocality. These tools help to advance the understanding of the hidden structures of the models, and ultimately have an impact in applications, such as in traffic flow, where they can be used to study how to integrate nonlocal communications into a smart traffic network to improve efficiency and avoid traffic congestions.

Biodegradable polymers are promising materials for temporary biomedical implants that can provide mechanical support for damaged tissues until they heal. Using biodegradable polymers enables tailoring the specific functionality of the implants to specific patients. These materials also allow for tissue regeneration while avoiding the need for subsequent surgery to remove the implants at the end of their functional life. The degradation in biodegradable polymers is due to a hydrolytic process in which fluid diffuses into the polymers, breaking the polymer chains and forming monomers that eventually diffuse out of the polymer (erosion). A key obstacle in the development of effective biodegradable polymer implants involves a knowledge gap in understanding how mechanical loading and hydrolytic processes intertwine and their resulting influence on the time-dependent structural integrity and load-carrying ability of the implant. This project will implement a synergetic experimental and modeling strategy to address this knowledge gap. The project also provides students with technical training while promoting the retention of underrepresented students and military veterans. Additionally, virtual reality (VR)- and augmented reality (AR)-based learning modules aimed at understanding the interplay among various stimuli on polymer degradation will be developed and shared for the general public to use. <br/><br/>Specifically, this project will investigate degradation in poly-lactic glycolic acid (PLGA) polymers with different initial macromolecular structures, ranging from being fully amorphous to highly crystalline, which will provide variations in the physical properties and degradation behaviors. The PLGA specimens, of different shapes and sizes, will be immersed in saline water at 37oC while being subjected to various mechanical loading. Nonlinear time-dependent constitutive models that incorporate changes in the macromolecular structures and mass of the polymers will be formulated to describe the intertwining mechanisms in the mechano-hydrolytic process and to predict the changes in the geometry and size of the specimens during degradation. The goal is to address 1) whether the hydrolytic scission is purely a chemical reaction between fluid and polymer molecules, or whether the scission induced by mechanical loading leads to shorter polymer chains and therefore accelerates the hydrolytic process; 2) how different histories of mechanical loading alter the erosion process, thereby gradually changing the shape and size of the implant.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In spite of their scarcity, trace elements can play an outsized role in determining where living things thrive in the open ocean. Near the coasts, these elements may be found in abundance because of features like rivers which bring source material from the continents to the ocean. Far from land, however, trace elements are scarce. The most significant source of these elements to the open ocean may come from dust and other particles falling onto the surface water either directly, or within rain droplets. An improved understanding of this process will further knowledge of element cycling in the ocean, including the carbon cycle. This project will sample the atmosphere of the South Pacific Ocean and the Pacific sector of the Southern Ocean around Antarctica. Input from the atmosphere to these waters is not well known and the research results will provide much needed information to the scientific community. This project will support an early career researcher as well as a graduate student.<br/><br/>The deposition and subsequent dissolution of aerosols in surface waters remains a critical research area in the oceanographic community. Much of the ocean remains poorly sampled and improvements in flux estimates, chemical characterization, and fractional solubility estimates are necessary to improve the understanding of this important trace element source. This project will include a cruise in the South Pacific Ocean and one in the Amundsen Sea sector of the Southern Ocean, both as part of the GEOTRACES program. The cruise tracks will cover regions which lie downwind of dust producing regions of Australia and where atmospheric deposition could play a role in dictating distributions of trace elements in the water column. The flux of aerosols across the air-sea interface is a key research area within GEOTRACES and the broader oceanographic community. Flux from the atmosphere to the ocean is highly episodic making the capture of this important term difficult in the open ocean. Flux rates will be determined by the use of the cosmogenic isotope 7Be, providing a rate estimate for time scales longer than the cruise period. Aerosol trace element fractional solubility remains poorly constrained and is one of the reasons that biogeochemical models show poor agreement for marine trace element distributions. Aerosol dissolution will be tested in several solution of varying chemistry to provide a range of solubility estimates which are representative of conditions in precipitation, surface seawater, and in more aggressive environments which provide a high-end solubility estimate.

One such biomaterial is fibrin, which is an important constituent of blood clot. To successfully and securely seal wounds, fibrin has evolved to be a highly stretchable and resilient material. At the same time, fibrin is easily removable as the wound is progressively healing. These diametrical functions are made possible by an intricate, mechanically-mediated interplay between fibrin?s structure and its chemistry. In this project, different microscopy techniques will be used in combination with computational models to better understand this interplay. The knowledge from this project will also have direct applicability to other prominent, fibrous biomaterials ? such as collagen and elastin - and their mechanically-mediated structure-function relationships. Beyond its scientific scope, this project?s impact will be broadened as it contributes to the training of future scientists by creating research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students. Through a collaboration with the non-profit Science Mill it will also integrate lessons about the role of fibrin - and other fibrous biomaterials - in human health and disease into the curriculum of the non-profit?s summer camps. As a result of this work, Kindergarten through grade 9 students from all walks of life including students with minoritized backgrounds will be better prepared for careers in health, science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.<br/><br/>Technical Summary: <br/><br/>Fibrin is a semi-flexible biopolymer with remarkable properties. For example, fibrin can undergo deformations of several hundred percent strain without failure. Its deformability and many other physical feats originate from its hierarchical architecture that spans many orders of magnitude. As such, it is a prototypical biopolymer whose study will enable fundamental understanding of other, nature-derived as well as synthetic biomaterials that can solve many of society?s most pressing problems. However, much remains unknown about fibrin. Among those unanswered questions about fibrin - and therefore about other biomaterials - is how fibrin?s state of mechanical deformation affects its rate of enzymatic digestion, i.e., its mechano-lysis. This question is a critical one to answer as enzymatic digestion is important in the regulation of many vital tissue functions such as tissue growth and remodeling as well as in tissue dysfunction such as in cancer. In this study, this question will be answered on the fiber scale, that is, on the 100s-of-nanometer-scale that a single fiber spans. To this end, a regiment of atomic force microscopy-based experiments was designed in which single fibrin fibers will be deformed, while their digestion under enzymatic loading will be microscopically quantified. These experiments will be combined with a detailed modeling approach that is integrated into the experimental design. Through this synergistic approach, it will be possible to delineate the effect of mechanical deformation on the multiple physical phenomena ? such as enzyme transport, binding, and enzymatic activity ? that determine fibrin?s response to enzymatic digestion. To ensure that this study reveals mechanistic insight rather than merely fitting observations, the computational model and understanding of mechano-fibrinolysis will be validated on the fiber network scale in which the degradation of an assembly of loaded fibers will be predicted and compared to experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although these economic and climate forces are often studied separately, they may interact, generating potentially complex effects on ecosystems and the wellbeing of Arctic human communities. As an essential step toward mitigating threats and promoting human wellbeing, this research project seeks to understand how forces from outside Alaska, such as marine traffic, tourism, and natural resource extraction, combine to affect marine ecosystems and coastal human communities. <br/><br/>To examine the interactive effects of multiple distant drivers on Arctic systems, the researchers will develop a dynamic systems model focusing on the Bering Strait region of Alaska. As the only marine access point to the Arctic from the Pacific Ocean, the Bering Strait represents a critical corridor for both migratory marine wildlife and marine vessel traffic, making it an ideal study region for this project. The model will be based on the framework of telecoupling, which examines socioeconomic and environmental interactions across long distances. The interdisciplinary team will apply this model to address three important and interrelated objectives: (1) understand how telecouplings influence the habitat of marine mammal species crucial to subsistence economies and cultures, (2) determine the effects of telecouplings on community economies and wellbeing, and (3) develop different telecoupling-induced change scenarios and assess their potential effects on human communities and marine mammal habitats. Researchers and community partners will collaborate to incorporate local knowledge into the model and improve its ability to reflect on-the-ground experiences, as well as document concerns and local knowledge. Furthermore, the team will train four junior interdisciplinary systems scientists, and will disseminate research results widely to various stakeholders to help with the sustainability of Arctic human and natural systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In mathematics, certain geometric shapes with these additional structures are known as symplectic or contact manifolds. Solutions of classical mechanical systems can be interpreted in terms of flow lines of mathematical objects known as Hamiltonian or Reeb vector fields on a symplectic or contact manifold, respectively.  Understanding the evolution and distinguishing transformations of these systems led to the development of global invariants of symplectic and contact structures, which shed light on the interconnectedness of dynamics, geometry, and topology. The PI plans to build on her work in providing foundations and applications of contact invariants.  The PI will continue and expand her efforts to increase the access and success of underrepresented students in pure and applied mathematics. With the Rice Association for Women in Mathematics Chapter, she plans to organize a weekly Math Night at Rice University. She also plans to conduct (jointly with two other professors) two national studies to delineate forms of antiracism in academic advising in STEM fields and to examine the effect of academic advisors' practices on BIPOC (Black,Indigenous, and people of color) student psychological experiences and outcomes, and construct a set of best practices and effective behaviors in academic advising. To train future generations, the PI will co-organize two international conferences with professional development programming for junior mathematicians and will offer research opportunities for undergraduates.

The primary goals of this project are to provide foundations and refine structural aspects of nonequivariant, and (circle) equivariant contact homology, including the development of product structures and isomorphisms with symplectic homology. By exploring contributions from obstruction bundle gluing, she also plans to provide foundations for Legendrian contact homology in certain closed contact 3-manifolds.

Thus, they have profound impacts on the Earth?s weather and climate systems. The lack of understanding of complex aerosol properties, aerosol-cloud interactions, and aerosol variations in space and time contributes to large uncertainties in the climate assessment and projection. The project aims to investigate how aerosols vary vertically and how aerosols influence cloud development and properties over a large area. Findings of this project are expected to advance our knowledge on aerosol-cloud interactions and address uncertainties in climate change studies.

The key scientific questions are (1) what are the specific characteristics and seasonal and regional variations of the vertical distribution of different aerosol types? (2) how do the vertical distributions of various aerosol types affect the micro- and macro-physical properties of convective clouds and the associated precipitation? Three specific tasks will be performed to answer these questions: (1) to examine the specific and unique characteristics of the vertical distributions of various aerosol types in different regions and seasons; (2) to investigate the relationships between vertical distributions of various aerosol types and convective clouds and associated precipitation; (3) to disentangle different aerosol effects (i.e., microphysical effect and radiative effect) as well as meteorological influence, and assess effects of aerosol vertical distributions on convective clouds and precipitation on the seasonal timescale using process-level models.

First, the measurements provided by these systems are often not directly interpretable. A specially designed algorithm must process them to extract the information of interest and create, for example, the cleanest possible image. Second, the measurement systems themselves often have different configurations that can be used to collect information in different ways. It may not be evident in advance which configurations are best in any particular scenario. To address the above challenges, this project focuses on (i) developing new theories and algorithms for processing measurements and extracting the underlying information and (ii) providing guidance on how to optimally design such measurement systems and adaptively reconfigure them during the measurement process. Much of the research in this project is general and intended to be applicable across broad classes of measurement systems. Therefore, the advances in this project have significant potential benefits across diverse areas such as biomedical imaging, astronomy, computation, and communications. The project also involves an integrated outreach and education plan, focusing on promoting accessibility and awareness of STEM concepts for K-12 students through virtual and in-person outreach events.<br/><br/>Pushing the frontiers of what can be measured about the physical world requires going far beyond direct linear measurements. Instead, by design or necessity, many modern sensors acquire only indirect nonlinear or probabilistic observations of some object of interest. This project focuses on three motivating applications that involve such indirect measurements: (i) phase imaging, in which simple imaging systems use defocus to convert (classically unmeasurable) phase information into (measurable) intensity variations; (ii) sparse super-resolution imaging, in which direct imaging (photon counting) is combined with various types of quantum measurements to overcome ""Rayleigh's curse"" and achieve super-resolution of scenes with multiple point sources; and (iii) quantum state and quantum process tomography, in which probabilistic measurement techniques are used to infer the states of quantum systems and the quantum processes that act on these systems. Integrated with these applications, the project is focused in two overarching research thrusts: (i) structured inference, in which new representations and algorithms are developed for efficiently recovering low-rank matrices, structured factors, and other parameters of interest from indirect measurements; and (ii) adaptive measurement design, which aims to answer questions such as how to optimally design and configure the measurement system, how to incorporate structured inference algorithms, and how to adaptively adjust the measurement system state based on the collected measurements. Using atomic norm minimization as a foundation, the project develops new analysis of the nonconvex geometry of low-rank matrix recovery from probabilistic measurements and new techniques for sparse density estimation that allow inference of structured factors and other parameters from probabilistic measurements. The project also leverages modern machine learning and optimization-based signal recovery techniques to develop a cohesive and general framework that enables indirect measurement systems to adaptively configure the measurement system and ultimately reconstruct signals with enhanced signal-to-noise ratio, improved resolution, and reduced overall sensing budget.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do so, parents must respond appropriately to sensory cues from infants, such as odors and cries. Behavioral responses to these cues often differ between mothers and females without offspring, with mothers being more attracted to these cues and more likely to engage in caregiving behaviors. Mothers in some species also show changes in how the brain responds to infant-related sensory cues, so that mothers are better able to detect and identify these stimuli. However, almost nothing is known about how fathers? brains respond to specific types of sensory information from infants. This research will evaluate whether fathers show different behavioral and brain responses to odors and cries from infants, compared to males without infants, and whether this difference is influenced by the hormone oxytocin, which plays a role in infant care and social bonding. The results will provide new information about how being a father affects males? brains and changes how males respond to infants, which might ultimately improve understanding of interactions between human fathers and their children. These studies will provide training for graduate and undergraduate students, including students from underrepresented populations, and will be used as the basis for outreach activities in the local community and in schools for special-needs students.<br/><br/>Mammalian parents must alter their behavior to meet the needs of their offspring. This behavioral plasticity is mediated by plasticity in neural processes influencing parents? motivational, cognitive, and affective responses to offspring-related stimuli. Sensory processing, too, can undergo plastic changes in parents, enhancing their ability to detect and discriminate infant-related sensory cues. In mothers, changes in sensory function may be mediated by the pronounced hormonal shifts that occur during pregnancy and lactation; however, the mechanisms of parenthood-related sensory plasticity are only beginning to be understood. Coordinated plasticity in multiple parts of individual sensory pathways has received scant attention, for example, and little is known about how stimuli in different sensory modalities interact to determine neural and behavioral responses. Moreover, almost nothing is known about sensory plasticity in fathers. This research will use biparental California mice (Peromyscus californicus) to test the hypotheses that 1) fatherhood alters males? behavioral and neural responses to stimuli from infants, 2) these effects are enhanced by simultaneous exposure to stimuli in multiple modalities, and 3) oxytocin plays a key role in mediating sensory plasticity in fathers. Pup odors and vocalizations will be presented, both separately and simultaneously, to fathers and non-breeding males, and neural responses will be quantified using immunohistochemistry for the immediate-early gene product Fos in numerous brain regions as well as electrophysiological recordings in the auditory cortex. Oxytocin signaling will be manipulated pharmacologically to determine its role in fatherhood-induced sensory plasticity.

Metamorphism during burial and heating of oceanic plates at subduction zones regulates the supply of water into the Earth?s mantle, critically affecting how the mantle flows. However, the specific pathways and fluxes by which water is transported beyond arc volcanoes are uncertain. While direct tracing of subducted water is made difficult by its small number of isotopes, the noble gases are elementally- and isotopically-rich, are fractionated by physical processes and are ideal tracers for the movement of metamorphic fluids. Application of the noble gases as tracers of the deep water cycle requires development of a linkage between noble gas composition and the magnitudes of water loss during subduction. This project will result in a systematic characterisation of the distribution and composition of noble gas isotopes in ancient samples of subducted oceanic crust, establishing the framework for noble gases to be used as tracers of metamorphic fluids. The integrated research and education program proposed here will result in: 1) quantification of the key physical processes that control subduction-processing of volatiles; 2) career-enhancement for an early career scientist and a graduate student, and 3) broadened participation and enhanced diversity in petrological research via a series of formative research institutes targeting applicants from minority-serving institutions.<br/><br/>Earth's upper mantle contains an indelible elemental abundance pattern of heavy noble gases (Ar, Kr, Xe) that is strikingly similar to seawater. Because this is a unique composition in the solar system, the only credible explanation is that a non-disrupted, seawater-like noble gas signature survives the subduction process, generally thought to exclude more than 95% of input volatiles. Given that the noble gases are between 100 and 100,000 times more soluble in fluids than crustal minerals, even minor amounts of phase separation during release and transport of metamorphic fluids will fractionate the noble gas composition of subducting rock. How, then, do noble gases escape removal and significant fractionation during subduction? And, can the noble gases be used to quantitatively trace the subduction of water? This project will address these questions through the integration of noble gas compositions, mineralogically-bound H2O contents and thermodynamic estimates of pressure and temperature from exhumed subduction-related rocks. The proposed research will systematically test the overarching hypothesis that noble gas composition is principally controlled by the extent of metamorphic dehydration during subduction. At the core of the educational component of this CAREER program is the development and implementation of a series of summer institutes dedicated to enhancing diversity in petrological research. This program will result in the petrological training of a cohort of undergraduates, many of whom will come from minority-serving institutions.

Climate models and paleoclimate observations disagree about the magnitude of variability at interdecadal-and-longer time scales. This creates uncertainty in estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity (temperature increase that result from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration) and in model projections of long-term climate variability. The key to reconciling this contradiction lies in understanding the relative importance of forced and unforced variability in the paleoclimate records. If the paleoclimate reconstructions are correct, then the missing physics must be identified, whether it be a lack of sensitivity to external forcing (e.g. volcanic eruption, solar variability, changing concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols), or an underrepresentation of internal variability (internal mechanisms within the climate system). This project proposes a framework for fingerprinting forced and unforced climate variability in Holocene paleoclimate records, based on their different spatial and temporal statistics. Specifically, the researchers will develop spatio-temporal fingerprints for forced and unforced climate variability, using a combination of Global Circulation Models (GCMs) simulations and fundamental physical principles, and apply them to the multiproxy paleoclimate record of Holocene climate variability. <br/><br/>The researchers will build the fingerprints starting from GCMs, which provide a complete representation of the climate system and have the ability to disaggregate forced and unforced variability. The proxy-system models (forward modelling of mechanistic processes either biological or chemical, by which climate variability is recorded in a climate archive such as corals or ice cores) will be used to evaluate how these fingerprints are expressed in proxy records that are sparse, noisy, and can alter the statistics of climate signals. Given well-documented deficiencies in the ability of GCMs to simulate low-frequency variability in both observations and proxies, the GCM-based fingerprints will be complemented with physical-statistical stochastic models.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include a greater understanding of Holocene climate variability and modeled projections by (1) building a single coherent picture of the factors controlling the response of temperature, hydrology, and hydroclimate proxies in the climate system; and (2) improving the physical interpretation of the low-frequency climate variability recorded in paleoclimate records. This research will potentially illuminate both the nature and sources of climate variability over the Holocene, and the physical mechanisms responsible. This has large implications for interpreting the recent observational record, and for inferences of climate projections. The statistical frameworks, model simulations, and simple dynamical models developed in this project will serve as a conceptual framework for climate-related research across the Earth Sciences and over all geologic timescales.<br/><br/>The project will provide scientific training and professional development for two undergraduate and two graduate students.

Thus, understanding how to control heat transfer at the nanoscale is critical in many engineering applications. Heat conduction in semiconductor crystals is dominated by collective atomic vibrations known as phonons. Conventionally, phonons are treated as particles that can propagate through a material, thus carrying heat, and can be scattered by material defects or other phonons. However, the wave nature of phonons can emerge or even dominate heat conduction in structures composed of periodically or quasi-periodically arranged components, e.g., quantum cascade lasers made of alternating layers of materials and integrated circuits containing densely packed nano-transistors. In those structures, the propagation of phonons can be promoted by constructive interference or halted by destructive interference. This project aims to explore these intriguing wave behaviors and elucidate the transition between particle-like and wave-like phonons through complementary computational and experimental techniques. This research will lead to novel engineering strategies to maximize heat dissipation in modern devices like quantum cascade lasers and integrated circuits or minimize heat conduction in thermoelectric materials and thermal barriers. This project will tightly integrate research, education, and outreach?including themed science exhibits, new curriculum development, hands-on research mentoring, and online course and research tool sharing?to have a broad, long-term impact on STEM education for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students. <br/><br/>The research objectives of this project are to: 1) rigorously understand the transport, scattering, and localization of wave-like phonons in periodic, quasi-periodic, and aperiodic structures, leveraging complementary spectral phonon analysis and phonon spectroscopy techniques; and 2) minimize lattice thermal transport through decoupled suppression of wave-like and particle-like phonon transport, leveraging machine learning-aided spectral phonon analysis and structure optimization. The proposed research on the wave nature of phonons can greatly advance the state of knowledge of thermal transport in crystalline solids, which has until now been primarily based on the particle nature of phonons. Such knowledge will enable the development of novel engineering strategies based on the wave nature of phonons, breaking the bottleneck of the thermal design or management of various heat transfer-limited technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, the synergy between discrete probability, algorithms and statistical physics has provided a new approach for designing self-organizing particle systems by harnessing collective, emergent behavior of physical systems.  The laws of physics play an increasingly important role in collective behavior at the nano- and micro-scales, especially since individual agents are far less capable than their macroscopic counterparts.  Yet, while the principles of statistical physics have motivated many experimental systems, little has been done to make the corresponding underlying distributed algorithms rigorous.  <br/><br/>This project investigates how to program collections of agents to perform tasks by modeling the dynamics as self-organizing particle systems performing steps of Markov chains through local interactions that can be rigorously analyzed.  The limiting distributions of these chains have distinct equilibrium characteristics that can be used to program collective behavior. The principal investigators take a three-pronged approach:  First, they introduce and study generalizations of common statistical physics models, such as the Potts, Ising and hard-core models, to better capture the constraints imposed by micro-scale systems of interacting agents.  Next, they explore methods to better understand the nonequilibrium dynamics of these systems long before convergence and possibly subject to forces that make the Markov chains nonreversible. Finally, they explore how collective systems might be programmed through deliberate placement of obstacles and features in the environment, rather than programming the agents themselves, as many of these tiny agents are incapable of any sophisticated (traditional) computation. As an example of programming the environment, a new version of the Schelling segregation model is being studied where people move with higher probabilities if they are unhappy with the local demographics of their neighborhoods, but these preferences can be somewhat mitigated by the placement of desirable urban infrastructures that modify individuals' incentive structures and biases.  The project is having impact in promoting and advancing interdisciplinary research across many fields; education, through advanced graduate courses and broad, interdisciplinary talks; diversity at the graduate, undergraduate, and faculty levels; outreach to the general public and for K-12 education; and municipal planning, through coordination with regional planning faculty and the City of Atlanta.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

So-called zero-error capacities of such channels are the optimal rates at which information can be transmitted via the channel with a zero probability of error when multiple uses of the channel are allowed. While in practice the effects of noise change with time, the capacity theories available until now focus mostly on the simplified picture where the successive uses of the channel are independent. This project aims at establishing the theoretical foundations that would allow the estimation of zero-error capacities and closely related parameters in the state-dependent regime, where each individual use of the channel depends on its previous uses and the current state of the surrounding noise. It is using the developed framework to study a special case of information channels, which are viewed as strategies for games -- called two-prover games -- in which two players are tested by a verifier, through a question-answer process, for the joint possession of a certain piece of knowledge. Such games have until now been considered only in the memoryless situation where the successive rounds of the game are played independently from each other. The project is studying the winning rates of two-prover games, where the players and the verifier possess memory and the rules of the game -- the tested knowledge -- may evolve with time.<br/><br/>In the setting of information channels, the project is defining and studying the zero-error capacity of a channel with memory, which covers as a special case the usual zero-error capacity of a memoryless channel as a one-shot parameter. This is being achieved through the introduction of the confusability graph of a state-dependent channel, while estimations and bounds for this parameter are obtained by developing a measurable version of the well-known Lovsz number of a finite graph. In the setting of two prover games, the project is developing no-signaling correlations between players with memory, including useful subclasses such as the class of quantum correlations, as a far-reaching generalization of no-signaling correlations between players of games with finite question-answer sets. This approach allows the consideration of value-separation questions and the identification of the players' asymptotic behavior in a general framework, allowing the application of functional analytic and operator theoretic tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sensemaking involves students building and using science ideas to address questions and problems they identify, rather than solely learning about the science others have done. Despite it being a central goal of recent national policy documents, such meaningful engagement with science knowledge building remains elusive in many classrooms. Students from non-dominant communities frequently do not see themselves as ?science people? because their ways of knowing and experiences are often not valued in science classrooms. Professional learning grounded in teachers? use of innovative high quality curriculum materials can help teachers learn to teach in new ways. Yet teachers need guidance to customize curriculum materials to fit their own local contexts and leverage students? ideas and experiences while maintaining the goals of recent policy documents. This project is researching and developing customization tools to support teachers in their principled use and adaptation of materials for their classrooms. These customization tools will help teachers to better notice and leverage the ideas and experiences of non-dominant students to support all students in equitable sensemaking. During the project, 74 teachers from diverse schools will participate in professional learning using these customization tools. After testing, the customization tools and illustrative cases will be disseminated broadly to support teachers enacting any science curriculum in leveraging the ideas and experiences that students bring into the classroom. In addition, the research results in the form of design principles will inform future design of curriculum materials and professional learning resources for science.<br/><br/>A key element in science education reform efforts includes shifting the epistemic and power structures in the classroom so that teachers and students work together to build knowledge. Research shows that shifts in science teaching are challenging for teachers. Researchers and practitioners have collaborated to develop curriculum materials that begin to support teachers in this work. But teachers need to interpret these materials and customize the tasks and strategies for their own context as they work with their own students. Curriculum enactment is not prescriptive, but rather a ?participatory relationship? between the teacher, curriculum materials, students and context, where teachers interpret the materials and the goals of the reform, and customize them to adapt the tasks and activity structures to meet the needs and leverage the resources of their students. The field needs to better understand how teachers learn from and navigate this participatory relationship and what supports can aid in this work. This project will include design-based research examining teachers? customization processes and the development of tools to support teachers in adapting curriculum materials for their specific school context to facilitate equitable science sensemaking for all students, where all students engage in ambitious science knowledge building. The major components of the research program will include: (1) Empirical study of teachers? customization processes; (2) Theoretical model of teacher thinking and learning that underlies customization of curriculum materials; (3) Tools to support principled customization consistent with the goals of the reform; and (4) Empirical study of how tools influence teachers? customization processes. The project is addressing the urgent need for scalable support for teacher learning for recent shifts in science education in relation to both a vision of figuring out and equity. The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

The nation is driven by computer programs that are vital to everyday living. National security depends on the ability to withstand daily cyber-attacks. Economic security is connected to financial institutions securely moving millions of dollars electronically. National infrastructure depends on control systems that, for example, monitor air traffic and control automobiles. Humans connect electronically through smart phones, cell phone towers, and high-speed internet. The nation?s increasing dependence on computer programs is reflected in the increasing number of projected new jobs in computing occupations. However, the United States is not able to produce enough computing professionals for its needs. Learning to program is a well-known challenge and serves as a barrier to entry into the computing workforce. The research and education plans for this project aim to transform computing curricula and reduce programming as a workforce barrier. This project combines knowledge of how students learn to program (computing and engineering education findings) with how humans learn (cognitive science and education psychology findings) to examine learning to program at the intersection of multiple perspectives. To simultaneously focus on integrating research results into practice, this project will produce a training academy for future programming instructors. <br/><br/>This project will use theoretical frameworks of writing, learning, and knowledge to chronologize how undergraduates pursuing computing degrees develop programming skills. The research goal for this project is to produce a longitudinal model of undergraduate programming skill development based on direct learning measures and surveys of industry expert practices. The education goal for the project is to create a community and training academy for future computing educators to apply research findings in classrooms. At the completion of this project, the computing and engineering education communities will know: 1) how engineering students? programming skills, including thinking processes, visual organization strategies, and approaches for solving programming problems, evolve from introductory programming courses through degree attainment; 2) how writing, by exposing cognitive processes, supports the development of skills necessary for success in computing-required fields; and 3) how computing industry professionals? views of requisite programming skills differ from the skills of engineering students in their final year of their degree program. Project oversight will be provided through external evaluation and an advisory board of computing education experts. This project has the potential to improve the education of the nation's computer programmers and to increase the number of students who successfully complete computer science degrees.

To do so, it will study relationships between student success and the course climate and teaching practices of their computer science courses.  It will further analyze these relationships for students with intersecting identities, such as women who are first generation college students.  Many STEM classrooms feature passive learning approaches and intentionally or unintentionally establish create competitive course climates that inhibit collaboration.  Alternative teaching approaches that encourage collaboration and active learning are gaining traction in many undergraduate computing programs. Studies have generally indicated a positive relationship between collaborative active learning and increased student learning outcomes.  However, implementation of active learning varies and the results on student learning have been inconsistent. It is possible that the inconsistencies may reflect differential impacts of competitive, passive learning on groups of students with specific intersecting identities.  This project aims to explore the relationship between active learning and cooperative course climate on students with intersecting identities, including race, gender, and social class. The knowledge generated by this research has the potential to improve student success in computer science and thus broaden participation of individuals from groups that are not yet equitably represented in computing.<br/><br/>This project identifies course structure and sociality as two major components of course climate. Course structure includes features such as the course timeline, expectations for attendance or participation, and how grades are determined.  Sociality involves forming and working in supportive communities. The project uses the constructs of course structure and sociality to capture pedagogical components that faculty select and combine in their adoption active learning approaches. Correlations will then be identified between these active learning components and student outcomes, and will be used to explore differential outcomes across intersectional student identities. This knowledge may help instructors select active learning strategies that would lead to more effective student learning, or combine elements of structure and sociality to develop new promising pedagogies in undergraduate computing education.

The behavior of carriers with excess energy, called ?hot? carriers, is of particular interest. Hot-carrier materials have a broad range of applications including hydrogen production, local heating for nanotherapeutics, and photodetectors. Hot-carrier photodetectors show great promise due to their tunability and ultrafast response. Unfortunately, the low efficiencies of hot carrier materials have made them impractical for use in devices. The PIs have recently discovered that alloys of noble metals and transition metals have the potential to efficiently generate long-lived hot carriers, a breakthrough in the field. This project will investigate transition metal alloys and their ability to generate and efficiently transport above-equilibrium ?hot? electrons and holes in an optoelectronic devices. The proposed work is expected to provide transformational advances in the efficiency of near-infrared hot-carrier photodetectors. Education and outreach for this project will teach students through research activities and will expose people of diverse ages and backgrounds to the concepts of alloying, metal-optics, and optoelectronics. The research team will involve graduate and undergraduate students to perform this research in the team's laboratories and partner with local middle and high schools to involve 6th through 12th-grade students in hands-on scientific work. High school students from local Baton Rouge high schools will participate in annual summer in-lab residency programs and middle-school students in the Philadelphia area will participate in a solar race by building, testing, and racing shoebox-sized solar powered cars. This project is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM) and Metals and Metallic Nanostructures (MMN) programs of the Division of Materials Research.<br/><br/>Hot-carrier generation in metals is a promising route to convert photons into electrical charges for near-infrared (NIR) optoelectronic devices. Hot-carrier optoelectronic devices offer below-bandgap charge generation, ultrafast response times, and spectral and polarization control. These features are expected to result in transformative advances in optoelectronics. However, current hot-carrier devices exhibit low efficiencies due to poor carrier generation and collection rates. Photoexcited metals can generate hot carriers via interband, intraband, and plasmon-assisted Landau damping. While noble metals have been extensively explored for generating hot carriers via interband transitions, NIR photons do not have enough energy to overcome their interband energy threshold. Intraband- and plasmon-driven hot-carrier generation can occur at these lower excitation energies, but only if additional momentum is provided. The research team hypothesizes that band hybridization in transition metal alloys will result in emergent properties and new pathways for NIR hot-carrier generation. The team recently reported that, when photoexcited at 1550 nm, an Au50Pd50 alloy having NIR accessible interband transitions exhibited 20-fold more 0.8 eV hot holes than pure Au and 3-times longer lifetime than pure Pd. The team will build on this exciting result by pursuing the following specific aims: 1). Use first-principles simulations to determine candidate transition metal alloys that excel at hot-carrier generation in the NIR, 2). Deposit alloy films via thermal co-evaporation and use resonant synchrotron-based photoemission to verify the predicted electronic properties, 3). Determine the effect alloying has on carrier lifetime using transient absorption spectroscopy and 4). Fabricate below-bandgap photoconductors using alloy absorbers and characterize their electrical response. The research team is well suited to pursue these aims with expertise in alloy theory, photoemission, metal film growth, device fabrication, and ultrafast spectroscopy. Transition metal alloys offer an exciting palette for synthesizing new hot-carrier materials, and the team is well-positioned to investigate their structure-function relationship.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fatigue of a material begins at the atomic scale under repeated physical pressure (loading) and result in nucleation (birth) of small cracks. The cracks can grow under variable loads and produce component and structural failures. New experimental tools, such as high resolution microscopy,  allows visualization of the atomic motions that are responsible for fatigue phenomenon, and these measurements provide unprecedented insight into processes that result in the beginning of microscopic crack formation. These experiments can also provide a critical check on the models aimed at predicting when fatigue starts. With better understanding, one can develop new materials that withstand fatigue. The focus of the work is on a special class of metals, called shape memory materials, that change their shape upon load and recover their original shape upon removal of the load. This phenomenon is similar to how rubber stretches and returns to its original shape upon release of the applied force.  These shape memory materials can potentially exhibit higher fatigue resistance compared to conventional steels and aluminum alloys. The proposed work will advance understanding of the mechanism of nucleation and improve fatigue lifetimes, quantifying stochasticity (variability in the results) linked to the underlying microstructure, ultimately improving the safety and reliability of components and structures. To enhance education in this field, senior design projects that involves building a fatigue test machine will be introduced. A new textbook on fatigue that covers current methods of measuring fatigue and the different models of fatigue will also be produced.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>The intellectual aims of this work centers on a better understanding of fatigue initiation behavior from fundamental atomistic to representative micro-mechanical scales to enable determination of fatigue resistance and enhanced predictability of lifetime. To verify the models at various length scales and mitigate risks of any unwarranted artefacts in the predictive procedures, the proposed experiments include single-crystal mechanical tests and High Resolution Transmission Electron Microscopy along multiple judiciously chosen zone axes. Information obtained will be of a 3D nature and will be analyzed using Template Matching (TeMA) and Geometric Phase Analysis (GPA) methods, further developing advanced algorithms for the same. The modeling efforts will incorporate Frank-Bilby concepts for defect evolution along with Molecular Statics to study the energy barriers and Anisotropic Elasticity Theory for slip under to- and fro-(cyclic) loading, as it is established that material performance enhancement for fatigue resistance can be achieved by controlling such characteristics at lower length scales. Thus, utilizing such a unique combination of techniques provides greater insight into the processes responsible for the structural evolution under fatigue and allows for the direct observation of the underlying damage processes. Therefore, the proposal will create significant broader impacts in terms of improving fatigue design for high performance shape memory alloys by creating a new set of tools. Early studies have not elucidated the experiments and theory addressing processes at length scales that are relevant to fatigue nucleation. This research will have the capability to examine potentially new materials that currently remain untested but promise considerable advantages. The outreach efforts include preparation of a textbook on fatigue combining theory and experiments, and a design project for fatigue initiation experiments under rotary-bending of wires subject to different mean strains<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will study light confined in the interior part of the spherical interface by using the difference in refraction indexes on the opposite sides of the interface. This novel confinement enables the researchers to study the details of the thermal fluctuations of the ultrasoft interface with an unprecedent resolution and accuracy using the modes of the confined light. In addition to providing information about thermal motion of the molecules, optical excitations confined by the interface allow researchers to optically affect its mechanical oscillations, which will, in their turn affect the optical excitations. Such so-called optomechanical interaction is expected to be significantly enhanced in the ultrasoft materials and will allow studying novel optomechanical phenomena. This international collaborative project will also contribute to educational activities of both participating institutions (Queens College, New York and Tel-Aviv University, Israel) by developing new courses around the themes of the project and involving students, especially those from underrepresented groups, in work on the project. In particular, this project will fund a research internship opportunity for a student at Queens College?s M.S. in Photonics program, designed to help students from underrepresented groups to enter the labor market in photonics related industries.<br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/>This project deals with optomechanical properties of fluid-in-fluid spherical droplets actuated as whispering-gallery-mode resonators. The elasticity of the droplet-forming interface is controlled by surfactants and can be reduced to the limit of ultimate softness such that any additional surfactant would destruct the droplet by Brownian fluctuations. The mechanical softness of the droplets does not affect their performance as optical resonators, which is determined by the refractive index contrast between the material of the droplet and the surrounding medium. The combination of mechanical softness and the resonance enhanced sensitivity due to the formation of whispering gallery modes enables the optical interrogation of Brownian fluctuations of the surface with resolution exceeding that of existing Rayleigh- limited imaging techniques. The extreme softness of the droplets results in the giant mechanical response to resonantly enhanced optical forces allowing researchers to achieve a strength of optomechanical coupling far exceeding that in any other available optomechanical system. The regime of the extremely strong optomechanical coupling enables the study of optomechanical phenomena well outside of typically available range of parameters. For instance, in these systems one can achieve efficient cavity-mediated cooling of the surface oscillations to the smallest phonon population numbers despite the penalty imposed by the lower phonon frequencies. The high-value goal of the project is to cool the capillary oscillations of the softened droplets toward the quantum mechanical ground-state while maintaining the bath at room temperature. The high risks of such a project will be mitigated by testing various gas-liquid and liquid-liquid interfaces at different temperatures, pressures, and surfactant adsorption-concentration. The experimental efforts will be accompanied by theoretical research, with a novel perturbation approach based on generalized theory of Mie scattering to computing optical spectra of resonators with shapes deviating from spherical will be developed. A theory will also be developed of sideband cooling to minimize the phonon number at the non-resolved sideband limit.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unlike other proteins, these intrinsically disordered proteins are floppy and dynamic. A major goal of this project is to find the key molecular-scale features that control this dynamic behavior. Disordered proteins are commonly found in all living organisms, and their function strongly depends on the structures they form; thus, this research has the potential to broadly impact our basic understanding of the molecular processes of life. The research will be carried out, in part, by graduate students, who will be trained broadly in physical and chemical approaches to the study of proteins, and thus gain skills needed to enter the technical workforce. The work will be done along with scientists at an Israeli university, which will advance international collaboration. Another side benefit of the project will be the dissemination of a specialized experimental technique, which is expected to have wide utility in the quantitative study of biological molecules.<br/><br/>Prior work has shown that a certain intrinsically disordered protein displays anomalous dynamics and elasticity, apparently due to what is termed ?heterogeneous mesostructure?: the interplay of fluctuating, polymeric behavior with distributed local structure formation. Here, researchers aim to investigate the overall incidence of these anomalous effects across biologically-occurring disordered proteins, and to study the molecular determinants that cause the behavior. The project is driven by specific hypotheses regarding the metrics of residue sequence associated with heterogeneous mesostructure. These sequence-based hypotheses have led to the identification of several disordered proteins expected to display a range of structural behavior. The primary work will involve experimental investigation of the structure and dynamics of those model systems, using both novel single-molecule probes and ensemble assays. If successful, the project will improve understanding of complex structural behavior in disordered proteins and its relation to coarse-grained descriptions of disordered-protein sequence.<br/><br/>This collaborative US/Israel project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the Israeli Binational Science Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sensemaking involves students building and using science ideas to address questions and problems they identify, rather than solely learning about the science others have done. Despite it being a central goal of recent national policy documents, such meaningful engagement with science knowledge building remains elusive in many classrooms. Students from non-dominant communities frequently do not see themselves as ?science people? because their ways of knowing and experiences are often not valued in science classrooms. Professional learning grounded in teachers? use of innovative high quality curriculum materials can help teachers learn to teach in new ways. Yet teachers need guidance to customize curriculum materials to fit their own local contexts and leverage students? ideas and experiences while maintaining the goals of recent policy documents. This project is researching and developing customization tools to support teachers in their principled use and adaptation of materials for their classrooms. These customization tools will help teachers to better notice and leverage the ideas and experiences of non-dominant students to support all students in equitable sensemaking. During the project, 74 teachers from diverse schools will participate in professional learning using these customization tools. After testing, the customization tools and illustrative cases will be disseminated broadly to support teachers enacting any science curriculum in leveraging the ideas and experiences that students bring into the classroom. In addition, the research results in the form of design principles will inform future design of curriculum materials and professional learning resources for science.<br/><br/>A key element in science education reform efforts includes shifting the epistemic and power structures in the classroom so that teachers and students work together to build knowledge. Research shows that shifts in science teaching are challenging for teachers. Researchers and practitioners have collaborated to develop curriculum materials that begin to support teachers in this work. But teachers need to interpret these materials and customize the tasks and strategies for their own context as they work with their own students. Curriculum enactment is not prescriptive, but rather a ?participatory relationship? between the teacher, curriculum materials, students and context, where teachers interpret the materials and the goals of the reform, and customize them to adapt the tasks and activity structures to meet the needs and leverage the resources of their students. The field needs to better understand how teachers learn from and navigate this participatory relationship and what supports can aid in this work. This project will include design-based research examining teachers? customization processes and the development of tools to support teachers in adapting curriculum materials for their specific school context to facilitate equitable science sensemaking for all students, where all students engage in ambitious science knowledge building. The major components of the research program will include: (1) Empirical study of teachers? customization processes; (2) Theoretical model of teacher thinking and learning that underlies customization of curriculum materials; (3) Tools to support principled customization consistent with the goals of the reform; and (4) Empirical study of how tools influence teachers? customization processes.

For instance, machine learning holds the promise of automatically analyzing medical images, a task previously reserved for human specialists. However, machine-learning algorithms typically require learning from large amounts of hand-labeled data. Manually labeling data is an expensive and human-intensive process. This project seeks to radically minimize the amount of labeled data needed for machine learning, with the goal of enabling cheap and rapid application of machine learning to new and important domains.<br/><br/>The project leverages program synthesis and weak supervision technology to minimize the amount of labeled data needed to build performant models. Weak supervision replaces hand labels with a number of imprecise sources providing a rough signal for supervised training. Such sources are expressed by labeling functions: small, rough programs that encode knowledge about the task at hand. The goal of this project is to have labeling functions be generated automatically using program synthesis, eliminating the manual writing of labeling functions and the need for programming expertise. The project develops a generic language of labeling functions, and explores efficient re-use of synthesized functions and richer means of user interaction to further reduce label requirements.

Recent studies have shown that brain imaging genetics is a powerful tool to discover the polygenic contributions for brain disorders and quantitatively characterize the neural systems affected by risk gene variants. This project will develop a series of novel computational tools to address the critical challenges and bottlenecks in current brain imaging genetics research, and will directly impact biomedical informatics, brain research, and data science. The success of this project will be used to develop new curriculums that incorporate research into the classroom and provide students from under-represented groups with opportunities to participate in biomedical and machine learning research.<br/><br/>The main challenges in current brain imaging genetics are as follows. First, most existing brain imaging genetics studies assume the linear relationship between genes and imaging features. Considering the high dimensionality of brain magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data and genetic data, this linearity is too simplistic. Second, traditional brain MRI research is suboptimal in characterizing brain dynamics because they usually focus on scalar statistics, which reduce the complex brain imaging data to a one-dimension and discard important informative brain network structures. In this project, we choose the brain modular structure as the feature representations. These kinds of representations can better describe the intermediate scale of brain network organization, rather than any global or local scales. The brain modular structure provides a promising bridge as the intermediate neuroendophenotype with a smaller dimension and a more focused objective to link genotypic and phenotypic traits. Moreover, how to derive the modular structure from multimodal data has not been well addressed. This project will provide efficient and biologically meaningful tools to map polygenetic components to phenotypes with the aid of brain modular features. The successful development of these new tools will have an immediate and strong impact on brain research, network science, and machine learning. Moreover, this project offers multidisciplinary training opportunities for trainees at all levels from K-12 to postdoctoral levels. Outcomes will be openly disseminated in peer-reviewed articles, outreach programs, and in the form of code/data repositories to maximize impact.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fundamental supramolecular chemistry is at the heart of this proposal, and our studies will explore and expand the utility of these easily-prepared molecules as fluorescent materials, strong hydrogen bonding motifs for self-assembly and molecular recognition, and supramolecular materials. This project provides interdisciplinary research training to graduate and undergraduate researchers. The broader impacts of this project also include (1) internship opportunities at universities, national labs, and companies, (2) individual development plans, (3) regional/international collaborations; and (4) mentoring opportunities to ensure students receive both a depth of technical training and a breadth of professional training to launch their careers. The PI's commitment to mentoring undergraduate research and to innovation suggests that the research will have broad impact.<br/><br/>This fundamental research aims to design and synthesize PN-heterocycles as new fluorophores and as recognition motifs in supramolecular chemistry, organic materials, and molecule/ion recognition. The aims of this project are organized around the following two complementary primary objectives: (1) to perform fundamental studies on these PN-heterocycles in the areas of chiral resolution, organic materials, and new fused-arenes featuring extended conjugation and/or prototropic tautomerism; and (2) to explore the utility of PN-heterocycles in supramolecular chemistry in the areas of hydrogen bond-driven self-assembly, oxoanion recognition, and chiral recognition. The ultimate goal of this research program is to expand the fundamental understanding of these new PN-heterocycles and extend these studies into supramolecular chemistry and molecular recognition. These new heterocycles have the advantage of featuring a very strong hydrogen bonding motif with an inherently fluorescent scaffold, putting both chiral recognition and signal transduction elements directly at the site of recognition and assembly. This research employs a combination of methods, including calorimetric, NMR spectroscopic, and spectrophotometric titrations, to determine the binding properties of the supramolecular receptors and to gain a better understanding of how structural changes influence their binding affinity, selectivity, and optoelectronic properties. The studies provide the researchers with broad experience in organic synthesis, physical organic chemistry, supramolecular chemistry, computational chemistry, X-ray crystallography, and the interplay between electronic structure and molecular architecture.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scissors congruence originated in Hilbert's 3rd Problem, which asks when two polyhedra in three-dimensional space are ""scissors congruent,"" meaning one can be obtained from the other by cutting it into smaller polyhedra and reassembling in a different way.  This question, together with its solution by Dehn, initiated an extensive program of research. Over the past 120 years these ideas have grown and now connect to almost every branch of geometry. Ground-breaking recent work provides a fundamental link between this program and algebraic K-theory, which is itself a deep and rapidly developing area of research.  Algebraic K-theory intertwines three major fields of mathematics: topology, algebraic geometry, and number theory. Developing the connection between scissors congruence and algebraic K-theory will significantly advance research in both.  This work also provides the platform for striking new research avenues that will bring to bear the tools and techniques of modern algebraic K-theory research on a wide range of geometric questions.  This project additionally includes a number of efforts to support students and new researchers in the field, expanding and broadening access to these innovative ideas.<br/><br/><br/>This broad new program of research develops the foundations of combinatorial, or ""cut-and-paste,"" algebraic K-theory, applies these new tools to resolve outstanding geometric questions, and expands the scope of combinatorial K-theory to new applications.  It brings modern techniques in algebraic K-theory to the emerging K-theoretic approach to cut-and-paste invariants, and applies this approach to a variety of problems in algebraic topology, differential topology, and algebraic geometry. Algebraic K-theory has seen a stunning revolution in the last thirty years due to the invention of trace methods, but these tools have not yet been developed for combinatorial K-theory, a deficiency that this project hopes to remedy. This requires developing the foundations of this new theory and exploiting connections to equivariant homotopy theory.  New computational and analytic tools for combinatorial K-theory will lead to progress on a wide variety of geometric problems, including applications to manifolds and invertible TQFTs, varieties and motivic measures, and fixed point theory.  Many questions in these fields have natural interpretations in terms of cut-and-paste invariants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This naturally leads to questions of algorithm design for efficient processing and inference on this data. There is a need to compress (sketch) this data before it can be stored, processed, or transmitted.  At the other extreme, in projection-imaging settings, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), computed tomography (CT), Fourier ptychography, or sub-diffraction imaging, data is acquired one sample at a time, making the process very slow. In this scenario as well, data may be distributed, e.g., for a jointly reconstructed functional MR images of different human subjects, with scans that may have been acquired at different hospitals around the country. In many of these settings, privacy concerns dictate that the acquired measurements need to be processed in a federated manner. Moreover, the distributed nature of the data necessitates the design of secure approaches that are robust to attacks by potentially malicious nodes. <br/><br/>Both efficient sketching and fast dynamic projection imaging require the ability to recover the true signal or image sequence from highly undersampled measurements.  Since the early work on compressed sensing (CS), sparsity and structured sparsity assumptions have been exploited very fruitfully for both type of problems. However, there is limited literature on the use of the low-rank (LR) assumption on signal sequences, and almost none that theoretically analyzes the resulting approaches. This project develops fast, sample-efficient, and federated (private and communication-efficient) algorithms for provably correct subspace learning and low-rank matrix recovery from  few column-wise independent linear, or quadratic projections. Extensions to LR plus sparse (LR+S) recovery are also examined. It should be noted that this problem setting is very different from other well-investigated LR recovery problems such as multivariate regression (due to the use of different independent measurement matrices for each signal), LR matrix sensing, or LR matrix completion. The team is investigating the design of Gradient Descent (GD) based solutions that are guaranteed, with high probability, to recover an n x q rank-r matrix from m independent linear projections of each of its q columns with m just large enough to satisfy mq > C (n+q) r^2 approximately, and that converge geometrically to the true matrix. Furthermore, this project designs novel secure algorithms that are robust to Byzantine nodes for the above classes of problems. This effort is expected to lead to newer solution approaches and analysis techniques, since commonly used assumptions such as strongly convex cost functions and i.i.d. measurements do not hold in this setting. Finally, this project partially supports the new CyMathKids initiative, whose goal is to provide sustained year-long support and extension in Mathematics to grade-school students from under-funded school districts in Des Moines, Iowa. It is intended to fill some of the academic achievement gaps between disadvantaged students and advantaged ones, and do so while the gaps are still small: the pilot phase focuses on elementary students with a plan to follow the same students through the school years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The model will be based on the framework of telecoupling, which examines socioeconomic and environmental interactions across long distances. The interdisciplinary team will apply this model to address three important and interrelated objectives: (1) understand how telecouplings influence the habitat of marine mammal species crucial to subsistence economies and cultures, (2) determine the effects of telecouplings on community economies and wellbeing, and (3) develop different telecoupling-induced change scenarios and assess their potential effects on human communities and marine mammal habitats. Researchers and community partners will collaborate to incorporate local knowledge into the model and improve its ability to reflect on-the-ground experiences, as well as document concerns and local knowledge.

At the heart of its development is linear-operator-based statistical learning, which provides a highly flexible and efficient platform to handle massive and complex functional data. The accompanying estimation algorithms and asymptotic theory also make useful additions to the toolbox of multiple fields, including functional data analysis, network and graphical modeling, and statistical machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is an exploration of the fundamental problem of analyzing the configurations observed in phase transitions in liquid crystals.  Principally, the project will elucidate how the shape of the interface between different phases is determined by a balance of elastic forces and surface tension. The results will be of importance in mathematics, physics, and materials science since development of various morphologies in coexisting phases is a ubiquitous natural phenomenon. The acquired knowledge will bring about new and powerful tools to experimentally control these morphologies, leading to new and exciting applications. This interdisciplinary program further provides opportunities to educate students in the mathematics and physics of liquid crystals. <br/><br/>The project will focus on the characterization and description of the overall shape and internal structure of soft condensates representing nuclei of the orientationally ordered phases shaped by bulk elasticity with disparate elastic moduli and anisotropic surface tension. The proposed work will consider a broad spectrum of liquid crystals, embracing nematic and cholesteric liquid crystals that are described by non-orientable director line fields and experience transitions into partially positionally ordered phases, and newly discovered ferroelectric nematic liquid crystals that are described by the director and a vector-valued electric polarization. The mathematical emphasis is on the analysis of stationary variational problems for energies defined over vector- and tensor-valued fields in two and three dimensions and associated gradient flows, so as to describe the equilibrium configurations of liquid crystals and dynamics of interfaces in a plethora of their phase transitions. The principal novelty of the proposed work is that it will consider singular limits of liquid crystal energies that impose severe geometric rigidity on admissible classes of functions. The primary challenges to the analysis arise due to high dimensionality of a target space and the need to consider singular asymptotic limits that result in highly nonlinear constraints. The combined analytical/experimental approach will be essential in that it will provide a clear check of success for the analytical predictions; these predictions, in turn, will guide the experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Self-organization and emergent behavior arise naturally across many fields: distributed systems and swarm robotics in computer science, interacting particle systems in physics, population dynamics and flock coordination in biology,  autonomous systems in robotics and control theory, and smart materials, to name a few. Recently, the synergy between discrete probability, algorithms and statistical physics has provided a new approach for designing self-organizing particle systems by harnessing collective, emergent behavior of physical systems.  The laws of physics play an increasingly important role in collective behavior at the nano- and micro-scales, especially since individual agents are far less capable than their macroscopic counterparts.  Yet, while the principles of statistical physics have motivated many experimental systems, little has been done to make the corresponding underlying distributed algorithms rigorous.  <br/><br/>This project investigates how to program collections of agents to perform tasks by modeling the dynamics as self-organizing particle systems performing steps of Markov chains through local interactions that can be rigorously analyzed.  The limiting distributions of these chains have distinct equilibrium characteristics that can be used to program collective behavior. The principal investigators take a three-pronged approach:  First, they introduce and study generalizations of common statistical physics models, such as the Potts, Ising and hard-core models, to better capture the constraints imposed by micro-scale systems of interacting agents.  Next, they explore methods to better understand the nonequilibrium dynamics of these systems long before convergence and possibly subject to forces that make the Markov chains nonreversible. Finally, they explore how collective systems might be programmed through deliberate placement of obstacles and features in the environment, rather than programming the agents themselves, as many of these tiny agents are incapable of any sophisticated (traditional) computation. As an example of programming the environment, a new version of the Schelling segregation model is being studied where people move with higher probabilities if they are unhappy with the local demographics of their neighborhoods, but these preferences can be somewhat mitigated by the placement of desirable urban infrastructures that modify individuals' incentive structures and biases.  The project is having impact in promoting and advancing interdisciplinary research across many fields; education, through advanced graduate courses and broad, interdisciplinary talks; diversity at the graduate, undergraduate, and faculty levels; outreach to the general public and for K-12 education; and municipal planning, through coordination with regional planning faculty and the City of Atlanta.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research results will be incorporated in a nanoscience course and shared with the general public in a monthly ""Science on Tap"" lecture series designed to promote science literacy and appreciation of science in the Colorado Springs community.<br/><br/>In this project, Kevin Tvrdy and his students seek to develop hydrogel media specifically tailored for the chiral separation of single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs).  Top-down modification of commercially-available Sephacryl hydrogels will be pursued, as well as bottom-up synthesis.  Biologically derived polysaccharides will be crosslinked using radical polymerization to form novel hydrogel formulations, and a select group of water-soluble monomers and crosslinkers will be used to form alternative low-cost formulations.

Heterocyclic  building blocks with defined stereochemistries are valuable building blocks for natural product synthesis, chemical biology and medicinal chemistry. For example, a majority of therapeutics used to treat human diseases contain heterocyclic substructures.  On the other end of the spectrum, heterocycles are also integral in the manufacture of materials.

The funding from the National Science Foundation  will also make a significant impact on human capacity building by training graduate students to enter the 21st century workforce. Outreach activities are also part of this award.  In the second year of the grant, ten faculty members from primarily undergraduate institutions will receive training on Introduction of DOSY (Diffusion Ordered Spectroscopy) a state-of-the-art method to study solution structure, enabling these faculty to takes such knowledge back to their respective institutions to teach students. Another outreach activity of significance is a graduate course on heterocycles designed to engage students from multiple institutions where such courses are not offered.  <br/><br/>Professor Sibi and his students are developing new methods for the installation of all carbon quaternary centers with control over relative and absolute stereochemistry.

With a citizen science focus, this project will explore innovative strategies for preparing science teachers through civic engagement, study of local environments, and transformational approaches sustained in partnership with schools and communities.  This focus will be paired with a context-specific, community-based teacher residency approach, a model that research has demonstrated to produce teachers who reflect greater demographic diversity and have notably longer retention as teachers.  Taken together, a citizen science focus and residency approach may yield project outcomes that shed light on recruiting, preparing, and retaining high-quality science teachers that reflect the demographic diversity of students in P-12 schools.  <br/><br/>This project at the University at Buffalo includes partnerships with Buffalo Public Schools and Niagara Falls City Schools.  The project?s overall goal is to recruit, prepare, and retain 20 science teachers across five cohorts of science career changers and undergraduate biology, chemistry, physics, and earth science majors. It is expected that project will contribute to a deeper understanding of how a civic engagement approach to local environments, when paired with a community-based approach to field experiences, can yield high quality, culturally, and linguistically-diverse teachers who have a positive impact on science engagement and learning in P-12 schools. Using surveys, interviews, and data about participation, retention, and academic performance, this project will examine the effectiveness of the project's interventions in preparing and engaging science teachers, and in placing and retaining these teachers in high-need schools. Project outcomes will be analyzed by building a series of statistical models, such as cross-sectional SEM models and longitudinal models. Quantitative data will be triangulated with qualitative data to provide a more rigorous assessment of project impact. Project findings will be disseminated in journals, at conferences dedicated to STEM teacher preparation as well as venues open to increasing the diversity of the ranks of STEM teachers, and through online reports and monographs. Findings can inform teacher education programs across the country regarding diversifying teachers in P-12 schools, with a particular focus on science teachers.

However, given the short duration of direct meteorological observations (~100 years), it is beneficial to reconstruct past changes in rainfall over longer time periods (i.e., thousands of years) in order to uncover the potential sensitivity of water resources in the Western U.S to future climate change. This research project combines measurements of ancient groundwater and state-of-the-art climate model experiments to both quantify and understand the dynamical drivers of hydrological change along the American West Coast during the last ice age (i.e., the Last Glacial Maximum or LGM, ~25,000 years ago). This project also includes a comprehensive public outreach component, involving the creation of a museum exhibit for display at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR). In collaboration with the University of Colorado Boulder, the researchers will lead an interdisciplinary course for students to design and prototype a museum exhibit that brings to life the radically different atmospheric circulation and rainfall patterns present during the LGM.<br/>The first research component of this project involves a field campaign to collect groundwater samples from a network of wells within the Columbia Plateau Aquifer system in northeastern Oregon and southeastern Washington, which will provide a much-needed quantitative constraint on LGM hydroclimate in the data-poor Pacific Northwest. A new analytical technique for high-precision measurements of dissolved noble gas concentrations and Krypton and Xenon isotope ratios within the groundwater will be employed to reconstruct past temperature and regional water table depth. The second research component of the project involves climate model experiments using NCAR?s Community Earth System Model version 1.2 (CESM1) to build upon existing fully equilibrated climate simulations to study the influence of different LGM boundary conditions (ice sheet albedo/topography, greenhouse gases, orbital forcing, etc) on North Pacific atmospheric circulation and the intensity, variability, and landfalling orientation of moisture-rich storms known as Atmospheric Rivers (ARs). The project also includes a series of time-slice experiments, simulating both deglacial and glacial conditions, to examine the transient response of ARs and western North American hydroclimate to shrinking and growing continental ice sheets. Finally, detailed comparisons will be made between these model simulations and the proxy reconstructions of Pacific Northwest water table depths.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biological diversity encompasses not only numbers of species but the functional diversity that they exhibit.  Organisms work in a variety of ways, and often exhibit trade-offs and multiple solutions.  One example of a trade-off is the negative relationship between the number of offspring produced and the size of individual offspring, as documented in many groups of plants and animals. This trade-off is often attributed to a constraint on the total amount of energy available for reproduction.  Multiple solutions are apparent in the various ways that flight has evolved (e.g., birds versus bats).  This research project addresses both of these phenomena in the context of a novel experiment that involves selective breeding for high voluntary levels of exercise in house mice.  Two hypotheses will be tested: (1) selection for high activity is associated with reductions in lifetime reproductive success, representing a trade-off between locomotor activity and fitness, and (2) the trade-off between average running speed and duration that has evolved among the high-activity mouse lines is reflected in corresponding differences in characteristics of their muscle tissues.  The project will help to elucidate the fundamental nature of biodiversity.  The results will be disseminated in scientific publications and Wikipedia pages will be created and updated.  An online Open Educational Resource version of Ecological and Evolutionary Physiology, an undergraduate course, will be developed.  This project will involve training for both graduate students and undergraduates in a collaborative, integrative, and cross-disciplinary research setting.  To increase participation and diversity, students from underrepresented groups and educationally or economically disadvantaged backgrounds will be recruited.<br/><br/><br/>Trade-offs and multiple solutions are inherent to life and appear to underlie a substantial amount of the variation in biodiversity over time.  However, few studies have used experimental evolution to address these topics.  The proposed research will use selection for high locomotor activity, in a model organism (laboratory house mice), to elucidate trade-offs and multiple solutions during locomotor evolution.  Because locomotor activity is a key component of the life history of animals, results of these studies should provide insight into general principles.  The research will take advantage of a unique resource comprising four replicate lines of High Runner mice that have been selectively bred for more than 90 generations for voluntary locomotor activity, and an additional four lines that serve as non-selected Controls.  Aim 1 will test for reduced lifetime reproductive success in the selected lines and whether this trade-off manifests in different ways in the replicate lines (e.g., reduced litter size vs. reduced length of reproductive lifespan).  Aim 2 will test whether trade-offs in muscle function underlie the trade-off between average running speed and duration that has evolved among the four selected lines, and if multiple solutions at the level of muscle performance are involved.  The mouse lines will be made available to other researchers, and the online course materials and Wikipedia content to be developed will be broadly disseminated.

The molecules involved can be thought of as synthetic relatives of the natural base pairs that link together the two strands of the DNA double helix.  These natural base pairs link together in a highly specific fashion, a feature necessary for the reliable transfer of genetic information.  In the synthetic versions under investigation, the linkages also are highly specific, but, unlike their natural cousins, the strength of the linkage should be switchable, reversibly going from weak to strong by using electron transfer to induce proton transfer between base pairs.  The resulting highly selective ON/OFF binding may find application in a variety of smart materials and sensing systems, as well as molecular devices and machines.  In addition, the research itself, which involves a variety of skill sets, will provide an excellent, well-rounded education to the diverse group of students involved, including graduate, undergraduate and high school students, many of whom are from groups underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>More specifically, the primary goal of this project is to explore the generality and test the limits of using electron transfer to greatly alter binding strength in hydrogen bond (H-bond) heterodimers (base pairs) by inducing proton transfer across a H-bond.

In Aim 1 of this project, Professor Smith and her students aim to significantly expand upon a previous result in which a 10^5-fold increase in binding strength in a 3 H-bond dimer is observed by using the same reduction-based redox couple to create 4 and 6 H-bond heterodimers and by exploring the use of 2 different oxidation-based couples to create new highly redox-responsive 3 H-bond dimers. Furthermore, fundamental issues governing the strength of the effect will be explored with simple 2 H-bond systems in a sub-project specifically designed for undergraduates, and, in Aim 2, aided by high school interns, the team will determine the ease with which the solution chemistry can be translated to surfaces by attaching the electro-active component to electrode surfaces.

Graphene, an extended two-dimensional nanocarbon material, is well known for interesting electronic properties; however, its structure is irregular, which complicates its utility in nanoelectronic devices.  In contrast, the PAHs under investigation exhibit well-defined molecular structures with graphene-like electronic properties.   The project is geared toward providing fundamental knowledge regarding the effect of specific molecular structural features  on desired electronic properties.  The project is expected to impact the field of nanoscience, and especially the availability of carbon-based semiconducting organic materials as components for emergent applications in areas such as quantum information science, communications, and sensing.  During the course of conducting this research, the students involved will be trained in advanced organic synthesis and material characterization techniques.  The associated outreach activities include participation in the ACS Summer Experiences for the Economically Disadvantaged (SEED)  Project and the Bay area scientists in school at Berkeley (BASIS) Program targeting elementary school students.<br/><br/><br/>The project develops synthetic methodologies for the efficient introduction of multiple fused aromatic rings in the controlled construction of large, tailored polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). This is accomplished with high yielding [2+2+n] cycloadditions that produce multiple fused aromatic rings in a single synthetic step. The scalable reactions are used to access a wide range of new carbon nanostructures, including helicenes, nanobelts, cycloarenes, and nanoribbons. A specific target is a family of expanded, helical PAHs that are to be studied in the context of host-guest chemistry and interactions with polarized light. Other targets include macrocyclic PAHs and their assembly by way of supramolecular interactions, and elongated, nanoribbon structures expected to exhibit properties as 1-dimensional semiconductors. Nanobelt structures that represent molecular cut-outs of carbon nanotubes are being synthesized and studied. An additional interest is development of strategies for linking the PAHs together to form well-defined, extended structures that help bridge the gap between bottom-up organic synthesis and top-down synthesis of carbon allotropes. The research aims to first understand the behavior of new nanocarbon materials from a fundamental perspective, and then (as a longer-term goal) take advantage of the modularity of the syntheses to rationally tune structures for desired applications in organic electronics and quantum information science (QIS).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scissors congruence originated in Hilbert's 3rd Problem, which asks when two polyhedra in three-dimensional space are ""scissors congruent,"" meaning one can be obtained from the other by cutting it into smaller polyhedra and reassembling in a different way.  This question, together with its solution by Dehn, initiated an extensive program of research. Over the past 120 years these ideas have grown and now connect to almost every branch of geometry. Ground-breaking recent work provides a fundamental link between this program and algebraic K-theory, which is itself a deep and rapidly developing area of research.  Algebraic K-theory intertwines three major fields of mathematics: topology, algebraic geometry, and number theory. Developing the connection between scissors congruence and algebraic K-theory will significantly advance research in both.  This work also provides the platform for striking new research avenues that will bring to bear the tools and techniques of modern algebraic K-theory research on a wide range of geometric questions.

It brings modern techniques in algebraic K-theory to the emerging K-theoretic approach to cut-and-paste invariants, and applies this approach to a variety of problems in algebraic topology, differential topology, and algebraic geometry. Algebraic K-theory has seen a stunning revolution in the last thirty years due to the invention of trace methods, but these tools have not yet been developed for combinatorial K-theory, a deficiency that this project hopes to remedy. This requires developing the foundations of this new theory and exploiting connections to equivariant homotopy theory.  New computational and analytic tools for combinatorial K-theory will lead to progress on a wide variety of geometric problems, including applications to manifolds and invertible TQFTs, varieties and motivic measures, and fixed point theory.  Many questions in these fields have natural interpretations in terms of cut-and-paste invariants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The solution is offered by hydrated layered oxides with a large interlayer region, such as bilayered vanadium oxides (BVOs). This research, funded by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, exploits controllable BVOs preparation via a low-temperature wet-chemical synthesis route, developed in the Prof. Pomerantseva?s laboratory and called chemical preintercalation, to incorporate specific amounts of various ions and molecules into the interlayer region of material structure. The structure parameters governing improved transport of electrochemically cycled ions and enhanced structural stability are revealed leading to advanced electrochemical properties. This research provides necessary information for the design of electrode materials to enable next-generation energy storage systems with high energy density and long cycle life. The fundamental new knowledge gained from this study also advances emerging applications based on reversible cycling of ions beyond energy storage, such as sensing, actuation, ion-tunable non-volatile memory and electrochromics. This project provides a platform to equip senior undergraduate and graduate students with interdisciplinary skills. The educational and outreach efforts enrich undergraduate and graduate curricula at the PI?s institution, enhance women?s involvement in science and engineering, and introduce pre-college students to energy storage technology through the development of a new intercalation reaction demonstration.<br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research at NSF, develops strategies to alleviate performance degradation of high-capacity metastable hydrated layered insertion oxides with an expanded interlayer region over extended electrochemical cycling caused by structural instability. The goal of this research project is to provide a fundamental understanding of how the nature and amount of interlayer species affect the structure and energy storage properties of this family of materials. Bilayered vanadium oxides (BVOs), which demonstrate unique chemical versatility of the interlayer region, serve as the model material system. Complimentary X-ray and neutron pair distribution function analysis is used to determine the positions of all atoms in the structure of BVOs to establish structure ? property correlations. The goal is achieved by testing the hypothesis that interlayer species define diffusion pathways and mechanism of charge storage by not only forming certain arrangements in the interlayer region but also directing the formation and intralayer structure of V-O layers. The hypothesis consists of three parts, each of which is tested in the project: (1) The nature and amount of chemically preintercalated inorganic ions determine the structure of V-O layers, thus affecting diffusion of electrochemically cycled ion; (2) Interlayer water molecules contribute to creating intercalation sites and diffusion paths for electrochemically cycled ions and their concentration can be controlled at certain value, enabling stability of layered structure with minimized parasitic reactions which cause performance degradation; (3) Further tunability of the structure and charge storage properties of bilayered vanadium oxides can be achieved via chemical preintercalation of versatile organic species. The ultimate aim of this research is to determine correlations between chemical composition of the interlayer region and the structure of bilayered vanadium oxides and to establish parameters that lead to facilitated diffusion of electrochemically cycled ions and enhanced structural and electrochemical stability of the electrodes in nonaqueous Li-ion, Na-ion and K-ion intercalation batteries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project includes programs for student research at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate levels. The outreach programs will take place in both the Providence Public School system and the south-east Ohio Appalachian region. <br/><br/>The distribution of mass in a complete sample of clusters will be measured via weak lensing, measuring the distortion of the observed shape of background galaxies due to the curvature of space-time around the matter in the cluster. This distribution of mass will be mapped and compared to the distribution of cluster galaxies and X-ray emitting gas. Two-dimensional maps of the mass will be reconstructed with high enough resolution to identify individual concentrations within the cluster (?substructures?). In addition, the effect of these substructures on the estimates of the total mass of the clusters will be measured. This will determine the mass calibration biases in upcoming cluster surveys.  These observations are similar in depth to the upcoming observations from the Vera Rubin Observatory, enabling a transient survey in and behind nearby clusters with the first-year of data from the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST). The project will make public releases of deep optical images, catalogs, and maps of the dark matter yearly. These releases are designed to help other researchers become familiar with the data format and quality of the future LSST datasets.  The investigators will recruit students into science using proven outreach programs, while partnering with the staff at Ladd Observatory, the Brown Science Prep program, and the Providence Children?s Museum.

This weak interlayer coupling allows for the vertical stacking of different materials to form heterostructures with interesting properties and applications. In contrast, a lateral heterostructure consists of different 2D materials placed side by side with one-dimensional boundaries with strong bonding. The difference is akin to a stack of different plates (vertical) vs. being spread out on a table (lateral). This project will investigate novel phenomena that arise in lateral heterostructures with exposed boundaries on the surface. This allows for spatially resolved exploration of new interfacial physics and the rational design of heterostructures with desired properties. For example, the PIs have previously demonstrated that they can convert a 2D material from a semiconductor to a topological insulator. The latter is a state of quantum matter that behaves as an insulator in its interior but as a conductor on its surface. Coupling a topological insulator with a superconductor may give rise to topological superconductivity, which can be used for quantum computers. This project also aims to providing training ground for a competitive workforce in materials research. The PIs will strive to enhance the diversity of this workforce by actively recruiting and mentoring female and minority students. Research-based educational materials are to be integrated with outreach activities to engage the public.<br/><br/>The rapid advances in two-dimensional (2D) materials enable the integration of atomically thin layers with vastly different properties into heterostructures, where exotic behaviors that are not accessible in individual layers may emerge. Most studies of 2D heterostructures have been pursued on vertical geometries to take advantages of van der Waals interaction for creating a passivated interface with low density of interfacial electronic states. In contrast, lateral heterostructures uniquely allow for the heterointerfaces, which are typically buried in the bulk, to be directly exposed on surface for unravelling boundary-induced behaviors by scanning probe techniques. The PI aims to explore the versatility of phase transformation scheme empowered by the core-shell lateral architecture and apply the proximity studies to transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDCs) with correlated electronic behaviors. The local perturbations associated with the lateral boundary could provide the knob to tune the interactions and thus facilitate the understanding of collective electronic states as well as their interplay in the monolayer regime. This research also aims to address the feasibility of applying lateral heterostructures to induce topological superconductivity on the edge of 2D topological insulators. It sheds light on the investigation of Majorana physics using lateral templates of 2D materials, holding potential to implement topological qubits in fault-tolerant quantum computation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While innovations in accessible computing have radically advanced the independence of these people, the larger social contexts of interdependence and use are often neglected. For example, optical character recognition, visual crowd work, and text-to-speech technologies enable individual access to print text for the blind, but when a blind parent wants to co-read with their sighted child their goals go beyond mere access; they want to bond with their child by reading in their own voice and in ways that enhance Braille and print literacy skills for both themself and their child.  This project will contribute three novel voice-based technologies that will be freely disseminated so as to have broad impact.  It will sustain an ongoing community collaboration between the University of California, Irvine and the Dayle McIntosh Center for the Disabled, to teach future software engineers how to create accessible technologies and provide sighted assistance to the visually impaired population in the greater Los Angeles area. And it will support the careers of people with disabilities, who are underrepresented in STEM.<br/><br/>A growing number of accessible computing scholars argue that the field lacks a fundamental understanding of what ""caring for"" roles adults with vision impairments occupy, what interaction models are effective, and what accessibility challenges exist. As a result, technologies often fall short of supporting independence for the members of this community in that they do not enable full social integration. The dual research aims of this research address this gap by identifying both novel application domains and interaction techniques.  The project will conduct a content analysis of user-generated data coupled with interview data to answer the questions posed above.  Design-based research will then address what novel interaction models can be applied to voice assistants to facilitate parent-child bonding, parent Braille literacy, and child print literacy as a visually impaired parent co-reads with their sighted child.  Project outcomes will include a large-scale dataset generated by members of the target community, a taxonomy of untapped application domains and qualitative insights into user needs, as well as novel interaction models for voice assistants, all of which will combine to constitute the foundations for a nascent sub-field in accessible computing that focuses on technologies for interdependence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Exposure to these reactive species generates an array of DNA damage lesions that alter the genetic blueprint of cells and threaten all aspects organismal function, as well as the faithful transfer of genetic information to the next generation. A variety of repair pathways have evolved to protect DNA, including base excision repair (BER) in which damaged DNA bases are removed and replaced with undamaged ones. This project investigates how BER acts on DNA packaged by proteins into chromatin ? the form DNA takes inside cells. The goal is to determine how this packaging influences DNA repair and to identify ways that cells overcome challenges associated with repairing DNA secluded within chromatin. The project will offer training opportunities to students, including undergraduates from women?s colleges, in DNA chemistry, protein biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology. These skills will enable students to pursue STEM careers in research and education, and to contribute to biotechnology industries. Science outreach to middle school students is planned as well.<br/><br/>BER is a coordinated series of enzyme-catalyzed chemical reactions in which a damaged base in DNA is removed and replaced. A paradoxical aspect of this fundamental cellular process that still remains poorly understood is the ability of BER to repair DNA when it is packaged in chromatin, which can limit enzyme access to damaged bases. The research will employ an innovative ?repair fingerprint? technique that can precisely identify locations in chromatin where BER enzymes are catalytically active as well as those that are refractory to repair. This technique, as well as a variety of biochemistry, biophysics, and molecular biology approaches will be employed to (i) determine how DNA base flipping is controlled in packaged DNA, (ii) understand how the density of DNA packaging modulates BER, and (iii) establish the contribution of a damage sensor protein to BER in packaged DNA.

The research team seeks to understand what induces STEM teachers to continue to serve in high-need schools, particularly how compensation affects their decision to stay. School districts often use compensation packages (including salary and benefits like health insurance, retirement plans, and leave days) to attract teachers into different jobs.  However, when teachers make decisions about whether to stay in a job, they take other considerations into account, including working conditions. Using statewide Alaska employment information, this project will mathematically determine what compensation measures, working conditions, and other factors most strongly influence teacher decisions to stay or go. The project will then do case studies to highlight examples of high-need schools that have improved compensation and working conditions to retain STEM teachers longer than predicted. This information may help to inform policy at the state and school district levels by helping school leaders and lawmakers design compensation systems that are more effective in promoting teacher retention.<br/><br/>This project at the University of Alaska Anchorage and the University of Alaska Fairbanks applies Bandura?s theory of reciprocal determinism to a mixed-methods research design exploring two overarching research questions: (1) How does compensation encourage STEM teachers to stay in high-need schools, and (2) What other factors influence STEM teacher retention? The project will use statistical models of teacher job changes to describe the extent to which measurable characteristics of teachers, school assignments, students, districts, and communities affect retention, and how trade-offs between salary and working conditions influence teacher choices. Individual and comparative qualitative case studies of high-need schools with better-than-predicted STEM teacher retention will identify key determinants of teacher decisions to stay in high-retention schools. The research directly addresses known gaps in the literature around (1) the relative contribution of working conditions and compensation as factors in STEM teacher retention, (2) the degree to which options for STEM educators to move between classroom teaching and non-teaching jobs, including in the private sector, affect retention, and (3) how high-need schools that retain STEM educators are able to do so. The wide variation in Alaska?s compensation systems and community characteristics will facilitate broadly generalizable analyses, which will have potential to provide practical recommendations to schools and districts, as well as to influence policy in structuring teacher compensation.

The results will be of importance in mathematics, physics, and materials science since development of various morphologies in coexisting phases is a ubiquitous natural phenomenon. The acquired knowledge will bring about new and powerful tools to experimentally control these morphologies, leading to new and exciting applications. This interdisciplinary program further provides opportunities to educate students in the mathematics and physics of liquid crystals. <br/><br/>The project will focus on the characterization and description of the overall shape and internal structure of soft condensates representing nuclei of the orientationally ordered phases shaped by bulk elasticity with disparate elastic moduli and anisotropic surface tension.

The mathematical emphasis is on the analysis of stationary variational problems for energies defined over vector- and tensor-valued fields in two and three dimensions and associated gradient flows, so as to describe the equilibrium configurations of liquid crystals and dynamics of interfaces in a plethora of their phase transitions. The principal novelty of the proposed work is that it will consider singular limits of liquid crystal energies that impose severe geometric rigidity on admissible classes of functions. The primary challenges to the analysis arise due to high dimensionality of a target space and the need to consider singular asymptotic limits that result in highly nonlinear constraints.

Knowing the magnitude and timing of global ice sheet changes is important for understanding how past ice sheet change related to climate change. However, we know little about how dynamic ice sheets were prior to 26,000 years ago, when ice sheets were at their largest. This project will use new geochemical tools to tell when the Bering Strait was flooded or exposed during the last glacial cycle (the past 120,000 years). In combination with computer model simulations, this information will be used to bound previously unknown global ice volume histories over this time. Further, this project will support a PhD student, who will learn about how science can produce social inequities through the UC Santa Cruz Science & Justice Research Center. PI Pico will develop innovative teaching tools for making legible the roots of geoscience culture in scientific racism and imperialism. These tools will be included in courses taught at UC Santa Cruz and Princeton. Finally, all personnel will participate in the outreach to the Alaska Native Science & Engineering Program.<br/><br/>The history of global ice sheet growth leading into the Last Glacial Maximum is poorly constrained, as advancing ice sheets and subsequent sea-level rise during deglaciation destroyed evidence of past ice margins and coastlines. To address this uncertainty, this project will develop a continuous, non-traditional sea-level reconstruction over the last glacial cycle (120,000 years) by constraining the flooding history of the Bering Strait. Measuring nitrogen isotope ratios of organic matter protected within the shell walls of Arctic planktic foraminifera will elucidate the past connectivity of the North Pacific and Arctic Oceans, thus constraining the local sea-level history at the Bering Strait. State-of-the-art glacial isostatic adjustment sea-level simulations will be performed using the range of uncertainty on global ice volumes to model local sea level at the Bering Strait. Finally, this continuous Bering Strait flooding reconstruction will be used to test the plausibility of different global ice volume histories, and thus bound global mean sea-level highstands and lowstands before the Last Glacial Maximum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate models and paleoclimate observations disagree about the magnitude of variability at interdecadal-and-longer time scales. This creates uncertainty in estimates of equilibrium climate sensitivity (temperature increase that result from a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration) and in model projections of long-term climate variability. The key to reconciling this contradiction lies in understanding the relative importance of forced and unforced variability in the paleoclimate records. If the paleoclimate reconstructions are correct, then the missing physics must be identified, whether it be a lack of sensitivity to external forcing (e.g. volcanic eruption, solar variability, changing concentrations of greenhouse gases and aerosols), or an underrepresentation of internal variability (internal mechanisms within the climate system). This project proposes a framework for fingerprinting forced and unforced climate variability in Holocene paleoclimate records, based on their different spatial and temporal statistics. Specifically, the researchers will develop spatio-temporal fingerprints for forced and unforced climate variability, using a combination of Global Circulation Models (GCMs) simulations and fundamental physical principles, and apply them to the multiproxy paleoclimate record of Holocene climate variability. <br/><br/>The researchers will build the fingerprints starting from GCMs, which provide a complete representation of the climate system and have the ability to disaggregate forced and unforced variability. The proxy-system models (forward modelling of mechanistic processes either biological or chemical, by which climate variability is recorded in a climate archive such as corals or ice cores) will be used to evaluate how these fingerprints are expressed in proxy records that are sparse, noisy, and can alter the statistics of climate signals. Given well-documented deficiencies in the ability of GCMs to simulate low-frequency variability in both observations and proxies, the GCM-based fingerprints will be complemented with physical-statistical stochastic models.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include a greater understanding of Holocene climate variability and modeled projections by (1) building a single coherent picture of the factors controlling the response of temperature, hydrology, and hydroclimate proxies in the climate system; and (2) improving the physical interpretation of the low-frequency climate variability recorded in paleoclimate records. This research will potentially illuminate both the nature and sources of climate variability over the Holocene, and the physical mechanisms responsible. This has large implications for interpreting the recent observational record, and for inferences of climate projections. The statistical frameworks, model simulations, and simple dynamical models developed in this project will serve as a conceptual framework for climate-related research across the Earth Sciences and over all geologic timescales.<br/><br/>The project will provide scientific training and professional development for two undergraduate and two graduate students.

Other aspects of the recovery process involve interpersonal dynamics that occur between former partners who may continue to influence one another or instead end their mutual influence. Little is known about the specific intra- and interpersonal dynamics that occur when a relationship ceases to exist as it has. People who experience the dissolution of a relationship bond seek insight into how to cope and recover. More broadly, social connections are critically important in daily life; understanding how people react when an important relationship ends may provide insight into what people experience at a smaller scale when friend or work relationships are disrupted. The research also provides training opportunities for individuals who have been underrepresented in science and promotes open and transparent research practices. <br/><br/>To fully examine the dynamics following the dissolution of a relationship bond, this research tracks both partners to capture processes beyond only one partner?s vantage point. The project adopts an innovative study design that examines changes in relational dynamics pre-to-post dissolution and enables the documentation of complex and time-sensitive recovery processes. Partners complete weekly surveys up to a six-month period and daily surveys over a one-month period immediately after their current relationship ends. Specific measures assess individual processes (i.e., how I think, feel, and behave) as well as dyadic processes (i.e., how my ex-partner thinks, feels, and behaves, and how we interact together once our relationship ends). The project thus reveals consequential aspects of the recovery process, such as whether and how ex-partners contact and influence each other, whether ex-partners adopt biased perceptions that downplay the desirability of their former partner to facilitate recovery, and specific individual propensities to experience insecurities, negative emotions, and distress that impede recovery. Understanding the specific processes that affect recovery will provide information that people can adopt to promote effective coping when an important relationship ceases to exist.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While strides have been made in supporting at-risk students in mathematics, significant challenges still exist. These challenges include enabling access to and learning of advanced mathematics content, ensuring that learning gains don?t fade over time, and providing greater support to students with the most severe learning needs. One way to address these challenges is through the use of mathematics programs designed to span multiple grades. The purpose of this project is to develop and conduct initial studies of a multi-grade program targeting critical early math concepts. The project is designed to address equitable access to mathematics and STEM learning for all students, including those with or at-risk for learning disabilities and underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The three aims of the project are to: (1) develop a set of 10 Bridging Lessons designed to link existing kindergarten and first grade intervention programs (2) develop a second grade intervention program that in combination with the kindergarten and first grade programs will promote a coherent sequence of whole number concepts, skills, and operations across kindergarten to second grade; and (3) conduct a pilot study of the second grade program examining initial promise to improve student mathematics achievement. To accomplish these goals multiple methods will be used including iterative design and development process and the use of a randomized control trial to study potential impact on student math learning. Study participants include approximately 220 kindergarten through second grade students from 8 schools across three districts. Study measures include teacher surveys, direct observations, and student math outcome measures. The project addresses the need for research developed intervention programs focused on advanced whole number content. The work is intended to support schools in designing and deploying math interventions to provide support to students both within and across the early elementary grades as they encounter and engage with critical mathematics content. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Developing active, stable and low-cost catalysts for advanced emission control systems and fuel-efficient technologies is a major part of the global drive toward energy and environmental sustainability. Low-temperature catalytic partial and complete oxidation of hydrocarbons contributes to this global drive in areas ranging from clean fuel production to clean air.  Traditional approaches require large quantity of expensive and scarce platinum group metal (PGM) in the catalysts.  In this project, Professor Zhong and his team will develop an understanding of how alloying a lower-amount of PGM with lower-cost non-PGMs can achieve a higher catalytic performance. The precise determination and control of the surface composition of the nanoscale catalysts are critical for achieving the desired catalytic performance and the societal needs in sustainability. Professor Zhong will be actively engaging in outreach activities that build upon his research to promote engagement of students in science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) disciplines. These activities, including creating summer research internships in Professor Zhong?s laboratory and participating in Bridges to Baccalaureate, McNair Scholars, and Smart Energy Scholars Programs, will be directed at improving the education of promising high school seniors, community college students, and underrepresented students and encouraging their interest in STEM careers.<br/><br/>In this project, Professor Zhong and his team will develop a fundamental understanding of the role of dynamic oxygenation on the surface of nanoparticle catalysts consisting of selected noble metals (NM) alloyed with 3d transition metals (3dTM) in oxidation reactions of hydrocarbons, focusing on small hydrocarbon molecules.  The NM/3dTM nanoalloy catalysts with tunable metal compositions and controllable oxygenation on the surfaces will be prepared by molecular-engineered nucleation, growth, and nanostructuring. The detailed metal composition and the oxygenation on the surface will be correlated with the activity and stability of the catalysts in the hydrocarbon oxidation reactions.

While research has shown that listeners typically find it easier to understand speakers of their own dialect, a large number of listeners have lifelong exposure to multiple dialects, making them receptively bidialectal. This collaborative project explores the behavioral responses (speed and accuracy in understanding speech) and neurophysiological responses (measuring brain activity when hearing speech) of bidialectal and monodialectal adults listening to different dialects. The project specifically studies how context impacts what bidialectal listeners do, testing the hypothesis that these listeners switch between a flexible, but less efficient strategy when they are unsure which dialect to expect, and a focused, more efficient strategy when a given dialect is expected. The project focuses on receptively bidialectal listeners who have long-term exposure to their local dialect as well as Mainstream US English. Participants are tested in both university and community settings using a mobile laboratory (the Brain Bus), expanding on the typical populations used in dialect processing research and increasing participation in neuroscience research. <br/><br/>Bidialectalism is a under-researched and under-theorized concept in linguistics. However, the effect that long-term exposure to dialectal variability has on listeners? cognitive representations and strategies has implications for understanding how listeners process variation in general, and for conceptions of bilingualism and monolingualism as involving different cognitive architectures. By combining behavioral and neurophysiological measures, and building on recent developments in using neuroscience measures in speech perception, the project provides foundational insights on the cognitive and neural bases of bidialectal communication. The project manipulates dialect expectations in two different ways (using visual cues to talker-identity in one experiment, and preceding sentence accent in another), and to different degrees (strong vs. weak vs. no dialect expectations), to examine how generalizable context effects are, and to better understand where listeners draw boundaries between dialects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Growing population and development in many coastal areas, combined with rising sea levels, more intense and frequent storms and flooding under climate change, mounting economic inequalities, and aging infrastructure all pose increased risks to coastal housing stocks and, in turn, economies.  In many coastal areas of the United States, affordable primary housing is shrinking, aging, and deteriorating while seasonal vacation housing is growing and improving. Affordable housing is disproportionately damaged by storms, displacing residents who are more likely to be poor, elderly, racial and ethnic minorities, and service industry workers. While disparate patterns of vulnerability are visible, the mechanisms underlying them are little understood, which hinders improvements to housing policies. This project will integrate theories and techniques from multiple fields to explain how development policies and funding mechanisms within the context of tourism economies create and exacerbate disparities in housing vulnerability. This project will engage students from underrepresented groups as well as students drawn from affected local communities in disaster research, outreach, and policy development. It will also assist planners and policy makers by exploring the potential effectiveness of alternative housing programs and policies.  <br/><br/>Housing and disaster studies have rarely identified or explained disparities between affordable primary housing and second homes/vacation rentals as two distinct housing submarkets in tourist-based communities. This CAREER project adopts a convergence approach by integrating theories and techniques from housing and disaster studies in urban planning, sociology, economics, and structural engineering to understand the drivers of housing vulnerability patterns, considering both markets. It also examines the likely effects of potential program or policies changes. The project will first examine planning and funding mechanisms that shape housing vulnerabilities, including disaster recovery programs and policies. It will then analyze relevant patterns and explore interactions between housing and tourism and the consequences of those interactions for housing vulnerability. Although housing vulnerability is a multidimensional phenomenon, disaster studies often consider housing solely in terms of physical structures. This study will develop and apply a holistic multidisciplinary vulnerability metrics framework to combine physical, sociological, and economic assessment of housing vulnerability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, there are a large number of events and signals that occur following a traumatic injury, including electrical, chemical, and physical signals that are used to communicate with cells and the surrounding environment that current materials are unable to replicate. Therefore, this project seeks to develop a novel biomaterial scaffold with customized chemical, electrical and physical signaling to be provided to the injury site. Electrical signaling will be provided by movement of the scaffold, called piezoelectricity, or by targeted ?on-demand? ultrasound. This tunable, piezoelectric material represents a leap forward to materials that can better reproduce the requirements necessary of a biomaterial. The multi-functional, piezoelectric biomaterial will be fabricated, systematically characterized, and developed into a three-dimensional construct for future applications such as nerve regeneration. This study will greatly aid in the development and characterization of piezoelectric biomaterials for the future, and particularly multi-function materials capable of providing customizable signals. In addition, this work seeks to broaden interest in science by hosting a workshop for local Cincinnati high school students where students will have an opportunity to learn about piezoelectricity and material science. Overall, by developing robust biomaterials with enhanced signaling capabilities that better replicate the native environment, this class of material has the potential to revolutionize personalized medicine and deliver countless future therapies from the lab into the clinic.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Novel biomaterials capable of delivering the required signals to both cells and the microenvironment to replace or restore tissue in injury and disease states remain challenging to develop. A new class of multiple-cue material is greatly needed for a variety of applications including tissue engineered therapies, in vitro models of injury and disease, and fundamental studies of cell and tissue. To address this challenge for more relevant materials, this project will develop a biomaterial capable of delivering the relevant electrical, chemical, and physical signals to cells and the microenvironment to promote regeneration and integration of tissue. To accomplish this, the research project will: 1) Electrospin an aligned, biocompatible poly(vinylidene fluoride-co-trifluoroethylene)(PVDF-TrFE) piezoelectric, nanofiber scaffold with a high surface area and porosity that is functionalized with tissue-specific, decellularized extracellular matrix (ECM). 2) Quantitatively determine the electric potential of the scaffold resulting from mechanical deformation on the cellular and tissue level, in addition to quantification of location specific ultrasonic stimulation, which can be applied on demand as the scaffolds generate electric current in response to mechanical deformations. The resulting neuronal and Schwann cell phenotypic response to biomaterials and electric current produced will also be examined. 3) Utilize the electrospun PVDF-TrFE mesh scaffold to create 3D guidance conduits to address wound repair in nerve injury and assess the mechanics and total piezoelectricity of conduits while maintaining biocompatibility with cells.

Composites are ubiquitous in everyday life and can be found in commercial airliners, electric cars, consumer electronics and medical equipment/devices. The common wisdom of composite design is that a property, say ductility, of a final composite mixture must be within the range of values taken by the constituent pure substances.  Therefore, in order to toughen a brittle material, the general practice is to incorporate a ductile material to form a composite. The research goal of this NSF project is to seek a new composite design paradigm such that the resulting composite can be superior to any of the pure constituent substances. That is, can one design a tough composite using only brittle constituents? The research team will conduct large-scale atomic-level simulation of thousands of potential composite designs and apply state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms to optimize such composite design. With this new composite design, brittle materials can potentially be used in load-bearing structural composites, while functional materials can sustain higher stresses without mechanical failure. The educational efforts will include outreach in collaboration with the ""New Visions: Math, Engineering, Technology & Science (METS)"" high-school program and developing interactive learning modules using the Wolfram Computable Document Format (CDF) environment for core engineering undergraduate courses.<br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research and education on designing composite materials. Most materials lack highly desirable work-hardening mechanisms, so that oxide glasses and superhard solids generally cannot be used as structural materials, and silicon-based electronics cannot bend or survive impacts. The primary motivation is to devise a general toughening scheme to impart work-hardening to brittle materials by combining them into composites by exploiting stiffness disparity. To accomplish this goal, the research team will carry out large-scale molecular-dynamics simulations exploring the design space of the composite nanofibers, which will be used as a training dataset for state-of-the-art machine-learning algorithms. The composite nanofiber designs from this project, capable of work-hardening, can be used to synthesize tough nanofibers as reliable probes for characterization, data-storage or nano-fabrication, as well as building-blocks for macroscopic fibers, fabrics or scaffolds. In addition, the design strategy and toughening mechanisms for composite nanofibers can be applied to toughen bulk composite, which could open-up a new paradigm for structural materials. Importantly, with the new composite designs, brittle materials (low-cost silicate glasses, as well as superhard materials) can potentially be incorporated into structural composites. Using the tough fiber design, functional materials and devices can tolerate both local strains (volume expansion in lithiation or thermal shock) and global strains (service strain in flexible electronics or accidental drops).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Insects could potentially compensate for temperature increases by shifting their behavior to take advantage of cooler microclimates in their environment. However, species that have evolved in relatively constant thermal environments, like tropical regions, may have limited ability to shift their behavior in response to temperature changes compared to species that have evolved in thermally variable environments, like temperate regions. To understand the potential for behavioral shifts to buffer organisms from warming, this project will expose tropical and temperate dung beetles, a beneficial insect group, to temperature increases using laboratory experiments and field manipulations. Specifically, researchers will examine reproductive behaviors of dung beetles in response to warmer and more variable temperatures and investigate how behavioral responses impact offspring survival and development. The researchers will then build a model to predict impacts of temperature change on insect populations. Native American high school students and undergraduate interns will carry out key pieces of the research. The project will simultaneously support STEM literacy and interest in STEM fields while advancing our understanding of the sensitivity of species from different latitudes to environmental stress. Additional broader impacts include training of graduate students in physiology and ecology in the USA and at international field sites, thus strengthening students? global networks. This project will enhance infrastructure by adding insect specimens to collections in the USA and Ecuador for teaching and future research.<br/><br/>Tropical ectotherms, which represent the vast majority of biological diversity on Earth, are predicted to be particularly at risk from increases in temperature mean and variance. However, there is a great deal of uncertainty in these predictions because models often fail to consider behavioral plasticity, which could buffer organisms from temperature change. Theory suggests the capacity for behavioral plasticity should vary with the evolutionary history of organisms; species from temperate zones that evolved with more diurnal and seasonal temperature variation may have greater behavioral plasticity than species from the more invariant tropical zones. This project will incorporate realistic temperature changes (i.e. increases in both mean and variance) and focus on plasticity of reproductive behaviors of tropical and temperate dung beetles. Dung beetles?an ecologically and economically valuable insect group?have considerable control over the developmental environment of their offspring, which in turn impacts offspring phenotype, fitness, and population dynamics. Using an integrated series of lab and field experiments, the project will 1) compare plasticity of reproductive behaviors among tropical and temperate species in response to temperature change, and 2) examine how these responses shape offspring phenotype and fitness. Life table data will then be used to 3) develop a model to assess population viability of tropical and temperate species. Research will be integrated with a Native American high school education program and undergraduate internships to simultaneously support STEM literacy and interest in STEM fields while advancing our understanding of the potential for behavioral plasticity to buffer species from temperature changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Enzymes are functional proteins that act as a catalyst for chemical reactions in nature. They have the potential to make fuels, pharmaceuticals, and fine chemicals in efficient, selective, and ecofriendly ways compared to current industrial methods based on petroleum. The full power of enzymes has yet to be unleashed on chemical manufacturing because in nature enzymes work with other enzymes in complex networks, under mild conditions, that are incompatible with industrial processes.  This proposal investigates the fundamental science of how new biomaterials can be used to create useful multi-enzyme systems like those in nature.

However, the full power of biocatalysis has yet to be unleashed due to inadequate methods of integrating multienzyme pathways outside of cells into chemical manufacturing. Nature has efficient strategies to control multienzyme reactions using spatiotemporal regulation. For instance, intracellular structures like the nucleolus, which are liquid droplets consisting of multiple phases, confine different enzymes in each phase to assemble the ribosome. The nucleolus is able to function in the complex interior of the cell by sequestering the necessary components and excluding others. In addition, the nucleolus can then dynamically assemble and disassemble when needed in different stages of the cell cycle. If the structure of the nucleolus can be mimicked and used to perform multienzyme reactions outside of a cellular environment, this would transform chemical manufacturing by providing higher yields and reducing cost and waste. This proposal investigates the fundamental biomaterials science required to recreate the structure and mimic the function of the nucleolus. A library of peptide based complex coacervates, that form liquid droplets similar to the nucleolus, will be designed with varying interfacial tensions and encapsulation selectivity. This library will be used to evaluate the conditions needed to achieve stable multiphase coacervates and measure diffusion of additives within and between the phases. Finally, the function of different synthetic nucleoli will be tested using an enzyme cascade reaction and correlated to the material properties of the phases. The PI will focus on developing an experiential and bilingual (English/Spanish) summer program for ages 10-13 geared to improve science communication at home, a key indicator of choosing STEM careers. This program is paired with a bilingual social media campaign introducing ""biomaterials phase separation"" science to teenagers and coursework and laboratory experiences for undergraduates and graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although silkworm silk is the most investigated biomaterial, in part because of wide availability, the diversity of spider silks available can lead to new generations of hitherto unexplored biomaterials. Spiders produce many different forms of silk including ones used to construct egg cases.  Spider egg case silk proteins and biopolymer fibers have scarcely been studied, compared to spider dragline silk (commonly used to as the scaffolding of spider webs) and silkworm silk.  Yet, its mechanical properties (i.e., toughness) and conserved and repetitive gene sequence have been studied and shown to be significantly different from other spider silks.  The molecular structure- and mechanical-function relationship in spider egg case silks and biomaterial composites with nanoparticles will allow for the development of new bionanomaterials with predictably tunable optical, mechanical and thermal properties.  This biomaterials research brings together aspects of biochemistry, biomaterials and bioengineering, which requires a diverse scientific team, including physicists, chemists, biochemists and bioengineers from Arizona State University (ASU) and collaborations with Argonne National Laboratory (ANL).  This multi-institutional and multi-disciplinary research will expose graduate, undergraduate and high school students to modern transdisciplinary research and modern communication and teamwork tools for building and maintaining research across multiple labs and institutes.  <br/><br/><br/><br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>Spiders produce different forms of silk proteins or spidroins, of which, tubuliform and aciniform silk is used to construct egg cases.  The mechanical properties (i.e., toughness) and conserved and repetitive gene sequence are known for many spider?s egg case silk proteins and shown to be significantly different from other proteins used to make the more commonly studied dragline spider silks.  The proposed research team plans to explore the structure-function relationship in spider egg case silks, spider silk polypeptides derived from spider egg case silk protein motifs, and biomaterial nanocomposites of egg case silks with nanoparticles. Using recently developed methods for obtaining appreciable quantities of isotopically enriched spider egg case silks, molecular structure and dynamics will be investigated using advanced magnetic resonance techniques.  Besides natural spider silks, significant effort will be placed on peptide mimics derived from spider egg case proteins repetitive motifs, allowing structure-function studies, self-assembly and potentially in the long-term overcoming the bioproduction bottleneck for practical application.  Using both spider silk polypeptides and processed spider egg case silk, nanoparticle-silk composite biomaterials with tunable properties will be designed and generated for specific biomaterials applications. The biocompatibility of the spider silk polypeptides, their mimics and nanocomposites will be studied comprehensively in vitro and in vivo.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While research has shown that listeners typically find it easier to understand speakers of their own dialect, a large number of listeners have lifelong exposure to multiple dialects, making them receptively bidialectal. This collaborative project explores the behavioral responses (speed and accuracy in understanding speech) and neurophysiological responses (measuring brain activity when hearing speech) of bidialectal and monodialectal adults listening to different dialects. The project specifically studies how context impacts what bidialectal listeners do, testing the hypothesis that these listeners switch between a flexible, but less efficient strategy when they are unsure which dialect to expect, and a focused, more efficient strategy when a given dialect is expected. The project focuses on receptively bidialectal listeners who have long-term exposure to their local dialect as well as Mainstream US English. Participants are tested in both university and community settings using a mobile laboratory (the Brain Bus), expanding on the typical populations used in dialect processing research and increasing participation in neuroscience research. <br/><br/>Bidialectalism is a under-researched and under-theorized concept in linguistics. However, the effect that long-term exposure to dialectal variability has on listeners? cognitive representations and strategies has implications for understanding how listeners process variation in general, and for conceptions of bilingualism and monolingualism as involving different cognitive architectures. By combining behavioral and neurophysiological measures, and building on recent developments in using neuroscience measures in speech perception, the project provides foundational insights on the cognitive and neural bases of bidialectal communication. The project manipulates dialect expectations in two different ways (using visual cues to talker-identity in one experiment, and preceding sentence accent in another), and to different degrees (strong vs. weak vs. no dialect expectations), to examine how generalizable context effects are, and to better understand where listeners draw boundaries between dialects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Intentional movement is an important trait shared among humans and animals and is a fundamental actor in the dynamics of geographical environments. This research will enable scientists to model behavioral adaptation caused by disruptive events. The transdisciplinary methods developed in this study are generalizable to understanding adaptation in both social and ecological systems, contributing new knowledge about spatial behavior of humans and keystone species.

The subsequent 2017 detection of merging neutron stars, through gravitational waves with LIGO combined with the light detected by conventional telescopes, opened a new era whereby scientists hope to routinely study the universe using information analogous to both sight and sound. This project will directly enable future detections of gravitational waves through the development of robust signal processing software and an ecosystem of cyberinfrastructure services designed to analyze LIGO data in real time. The program will involve a diverse group of undergraduate students, graduate students, postdoctoral researchers, computational scientists, and faculty in transformative science. This work contributes to the national cyberinfrastructure as a core data-producing component for astronomy and will be relied upon by thousands of scientists globally as they progress the state of knowledge through the study of black holes, neutron stars, fundamental physics, and the evolution of the Universe.<br/><br/>With the goal of making new coincident gravitational-wave and electromagnetic observations commonplace, this project targets the development of a software framework for the real-time discovery of gravitational waves with the world-wide network of gravitational-wave detectors including LIGO, Virgo, and KAGRA. With this project, the investigators intend to provide a sustainable community-driven framework supporting current gravitational-wave detectors while developing new infrastructure for the LIGO A+ upgrade in about 2025.  The team will develop a real-time gravitational wave processing framework around the following themes: 1) accelerating the pace of discovery and dissemination of results, 2) advancing the use of machine learning and artificial intelligence in production gravitational-wave astronomy, 3) improving scientific robustness and reproducibility, and 4) increasing adoption of the developed software and services. The framework will be used to create libraries, applications and services for real-time calibrated strain data, real-time data quality information and a quick-response gravitational-wave search for merging neutron stars and black holes, all of which will culminate in daily gravitational-wave discoveries released publicly. This framework will contribute gravitational-wave discovery services operating in a high-availability mode with the goal of greater than 99% uptime. A host of scientific metrics will be developed into a real-time test infrastructure to ensure that gravitational-wave alerts are accurate and robust throughout software development and release cycles.  This research will have a far-reaching impact on several scientific disciplines with new gravitational-wave and multi-messenger astrophysics discoveries and it will impact society through a gradual change in the shared knowledge about the universe.

The goal of this part of the work is to guide the design of isolators with improved performance under large displacements. Other parts of the project concern composite materials and metamaterials. Composite materials are important in applications throughout modern technology and manufacturing.

The goal of this proposal is to develop new techniques for efficiently supporting large numbers of users of such applications, without hurting their quality of experience (QoE).<br/><br/>The proposed research is organized into four thrusts. Thrust-1 investigates how on-device processing and adaptive sampling of sensor data can reduce load on edge infrastructure, while minimally impacting QoE.  This thrust also creates an API between the operating system and applications for adaptation. Thrust-2 explores how to efficiently and seamlessly move work from overcommitted edge infrastructure to underutilized sites. It investigates both an application-transparent approach that is based on virtual-machine (VM) encapsulation, and an application-optimized approach that seeks to be frugal in data transmission. Thrust-3 creates tools and mechanisms to study QoE. Using machine learning on history-based data that is dynamically collected, it builds models of user-specific and application-specific tradeoffs for mapping application fidelity to QoE. It also creates tools for QoE debugging of edge-native applications. Thrust-4 explores how multi-fidelity applications that dynamically vary QoE can be evaluated without performing user studies. It develops a new evaluation methodology that is based on the concept of synthetic users, also known as ""droids"".<br/><br/>Through close partnership with industry and local government, this research will accelerate the emergence of transformative edge-native applications.

Their studies seek answers to questions such as what molecular sizes, shapes, and charge states are allowed to flow through the nanoscale valve interior, and what chemical modifications to the nanovalve are necessary to make it switchable on demand from the fully-on state to the fully-off state.  The insights gained will likely be useful for a broad range of applications, including selective access to the interior of cells to fight infections, nanoscale separations, and chemical sensors. The research team is also working to enhance the size and diversity of the pool of qualified candidates for advanced STEM degrees by investing in undergraduate research.  Elements of the research are integrated into the undergraduate curriculum, summer research opportunities, and public outreach activities in the surrounding community. <br/><br/>Measurement methods in ion-channel electrophysiology have traditionally been used to monitor the movement of charged species through nanopores. However, many translation events are electrically silent and cannot be detected. Furthermore, an understanding of the sizes, shapes, charge states, and flow rates of species that can be transported (or blocked), as well as their relationship to nanovalve gating mechanisms, is critically important for developing future applications within the field.

Such programming languages are widely used in the World Wide Web (WWW), such as Web browser extensions, server-side Node.js applications, and client-side scripting. While they are popular and successful to improve the Web with abundant new functionalities, at the same time, prototype-based languages also introduce new types of object-related vulnerabilities. Examples of such object-related vulnerabilities on the Web are like prototype pollution that pollutes an object property via the prototypical chain, and internal property tampering that tampers an internal property of Web application objects. State-of-the-art works adopt graph-based structures, such as Control-flow Graph, Data-flow Graph and Code Property Graph, to represent target computer programs and efficiently mine vulnerabilities in languages like C/C++ and PHP.  However, the detection of vulnerabilities in prototype-based languages, particularly the aforementioned object-related ones, is still challenging and remains unknown.<br/><br/>In this project, a flow-, context-, branch- and path-sensitive abstract interpretation of prototype-based language will be designed, implemented and evaluated to efficiently detect and exploit vulnerabilities of prototype-based languages, particularly JavaScript.  The abstract interpretation will generate a special graph structure, called Object Property Graph, to represent JavaScript objects, scopes, and variables as nodes and their relations as edges. The advantage of Object Property Graph is that it can efficiently find the definition and use of certain objects via Abstract Syntax Tree and all the properties of a given object.  Furthermore, the proposed Object Property Graph will be used to not only detect and exploit JavaScript vulnerabilities but also guide the generation of additional JavaScript code with object-related properties to trigger low-level vulnerabilities in JavaScript engine.

From simple to complicated flow passages and various flow regimes, this research will investigate the impact of dataset size and quality on learned functions. The educational goal of this project is to cultivate student interest in studying machine learning and advanced flow systems. This project will develop unique hands-on activities for K-12 students and provide research opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students on how to use machine learning for intriguing applications and ways to visualize convection.<br/><br/>Machine learning-based heat and mass analogy functions will enable spatiotemporally-resolved thermal characterization of thermofluidic devices where direct temperature measurements are extremely challenging.

This research aims to overcome the limitations of traditional analogy functions by leveraging the inference ability of machine learning models. Particularly, this project will study how the machine learning models can be used to infer the temperature field from a mass concentration field for laminar mixed convections. Heat and mass transfer analogy has been observed in systems with laminar mixed convection, but the derivation of analogy functions has been challenging due to the unstable and spatially inhomogeneous nature of the flows.

For instance, a child?s voice may be immediately recognized and reacted-to in the context of parental protection, a bird-watcher may recognize and follow the call of a house finch, or business associates may discuss the latest events over lunch in a crowded diner.  In each of these examples, a person directs his or her attention to the sound source of interest.  Once attention is directed, a human can continue to focus on that sound, even to the degree that he or she may not perceive (or is able to passively ignore) other sounds.  Computational listening systems, at present, are unable to replicate that ability.  If such ability was possible, computational listening systems could contribute to an array of application domains.  Current hearing aid technology is woefully inadequate in group settings, where noise often overwhelms the listener and the listener is unable to compensate.  Those who suffer from hearing loss feel socially isolated, leading to a lower quality of life.  Performance of hearing aids, and the lives of those who rely on them, would improve drastically if these devices could automatically adapt to isolate and focus on salient sound sources.  Effective acoustic monitoring could be deployed to safety-related applications, such as automatically detecting slurred speech from someone suffering a stroke, or to alert the deaf to important loudspeaker announcements in a public place.  Autonomous devices (robots, drones, etc.) could employ enhanced listening techniques to guide their movements or actions, potentially better serving or protecting the public.  The ability to focus on a particular instrument within a musical ensemble could lead to improved automatic music transcription systems and enhanced tools for performance analysis and training.  The applications of computational listening systems exhibiting perceptually-based attention are boundless.<br/><br/>This research will investigate the use of focal templates to incorporate attention into computational auditory scene analysis (CASA).  CASA attempts to reproduce (via computational algorithms and systems) the ability of humans to perceive an acoustic scene given only auditory input, and the underlying methods of CASA are modeled upon psychological principles of perception.  A focal template may be considered a type of dynamic time-frequency filter that passes only those auditory elements conforming to a pattern of interest.  Sound events of interest (if present in the audio) will be detected using spectral clustering, which has emerged as a useful technique for grouping ""like"" elements within a set; here, the goal is to group auditory elements that pass through the focal template.  This work will:  1) implement a model of attention into CASA through use of spectral clustering with focal templates,  2) measure the impact of incorporating attention on the performance of CASA systems in isolating particular sounds of interest, and  3) determine effective methods to develop focal templates while considering how to scale to the ""general"" listening case.  This project includes development of an academic minor in ""Sound and Music Computing"", a unique educational opportunity to prepare students to contribute to the research while integrating across STEM and non-STEM disciplines.  An outcome of this work is to build partnerships and strengthen the Computational Research on Music & Audio Team of Interdisciplinary Collaborators (CRoMA-TIC).  Through these activities, the project will:  1) advance the state of the art in CASA,  2) foster collaborative relationships within this field,  3) develop a well-recognized area of expertise and research capacity at Lincoln University, and  4) develop a pipeline for undergraduate students leading to related careers or graduate study.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lack of an accurate modeling approach that accounts for complex flow physics of turbulence over a permeable bed and coupled transport across the sediment-water interface is one of the key challenges in practical scale modeling of natural aqueous systems. Typical grain-to-globe prediction models of solute transport are sequential in nature and neglect the direct coupling between turbulent stream flow over a permeable bed and groundwater flow within the bed.  It is hypothesized that turbulence at the sediment-water interface can significantly alter the transient storage and solute retention times within the gravel beds. Specifically, the structure and dynamics of turbulence over a porous bed can be very different than that over an impermeable, rough wall. Quantifying the upwelling and downwelling events at the stream-bed interface and their modulation by the free-stream turbulence, as well as penetration depth of turbulence structures within the porous bed is critical for the development of macroscale, continuum-based modeling of solute transport. This interdisciplinary research will train two PhD students on direct and large-eddy simulations, volume-averaging techniques, and multiscale analysis. <br/><br/>Fundamental numerical experiments are proposed on turbulent boundary layers over permeable gravel beds representative of stream or river flows. Pore-resolved, direct numerical simulations (DNS), using a solver based on the fictitious domain method developed by the PI, of turbulent flow over stationary, porous beds will be conducted for representative flows in natural streams or rivers. The turbulent flow physics for a range of permeability Reynolds numbers for mono and polydispersed, randomly packed gravel beds will be investigated and contrasted against that over rough, impermeable wall with similar topology. The detailed, spatiotemporal pressure and velocity fluctuation data at the interface will be used to develop and validate macroscale, continuum models with variable porosity for large-eddy simulation (LES). The proposed research has the potential to transform the current state-of-the art reach-scale modeling approaches for solute transport used in river management. The pore-resolved DNS data will be used to design a learning module for a graduate level course on `Turbulence  Modeling' with a priori and a posteriori analyses of the continuum LES model. This learning module will be freely disseminated on the PI's research site. The DNS data and macroscale models on turbulence over porous beds will also be valuable for a wide range of fields, such as, noise control in aircraft trailing edges, heat and mass transfer in chemical and nuclear reactors, arterial blood flow and transport in endothelial walls, vegetation canopies; among others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

(1) When an object?s gravity becomes strong enough to trap light, the object becomes a black hole.  Inside the black hole the object continues to become smaller and smaller under the influence of its own gravity until it becomes a point with infinite density and infinite gravitational field called a singularity.  This project involves working out the properties of the singularities formed in gravitational collapse, and in particular the forces felt by any observer who approaches the singularity.  (2) Just as the electric currents in a radio transmitter make radio waves, so moving masses make gravitational waves.  One of the most exciting recent developments in physics is the direct detection of these gravitational waves using huge laser interferometers as the detectors.  One interesting aspect of gravitational radiation is something called gravitational wave memory: even after the wave has passed, there is a permanent change in the gravitational wave detector.  This project will study the causes and properties of this gravitational wave memory.<br/><br/>Gravitational collapse results in the formation of black holes and spacetime singularities, and the emission of gravitational radiation. This project will study all of these aspects of gravitational collapse, and in particular will concentrate on the approach to the singularity, gravitational wave memory, and critical behavior at the threshold of black hole formation.  The project will study gravitational collapse in asymptotically flat spacetimes in order to test the conjecture that both strong spacelike singularities and weak null singularities form in this case. A previous project developed a treatment of gravitational wave memory that uses a perturbative approach in which the Weyl tensor is the basic variable and thus has manifest gauge invariance in first order perturbation theory.  This project will use this approach to explore the relation between memory and the properties of the wave equation, and to generate memory waveforms using publicly available template bank Weyl scalars.

But despite its global nature the effects of global warming can vary even within small regions, depending on local contrasts in topography, ground cover, wind direction, and other factors. Such local effects can be be studied with global climate models (GCMs), but global models have limited ability to represent small-scale effects.  Even when GCM results are robust and physically reasonable they can still be misleading if physical mechanisms occurring on scales too small to be adequately represented by GCMs turn out to be more influential than the larger-scale effects that they do capture.  An alternative strategy is to use a regional climate model (RCM), which simulates weather and climate over a limited area using information from the global model to connect that region to the rest of the world.  The RCM can represent processes on smaller scales than the GCM, and a mismatch between GCM and RCM results can indicate a ""mesoscale surprise"", in which a local climate change expected from large-scale considerations is upstaged by smaller-scale processes (mesoscale is a technical term referring to spatial scales which are smaller than frontal weather systems but larger than individual cumulus clouds).<br/><br/>This project seeks to understand the role of mesoscale physical processes in shaping climate change in the Pacific Northwest (PNW), where the combination of mountainous terrain, proximity to the coast, and alternation of onshore and offshore wind patterns creates an ideal natural laboratory for studying mesoscale surprises.  As one example, GCMs suggest that the greatest increase in flooding will occur in river basins in which runoff comes from a mix of rain and snow-melt, since warming reduces snowpack and snowpack has a moderating effect on streamflow.  But in RCM simulations, which are better suited to representing precipitation in mountainous regions, the greatest increase in flood risk happens in low-elevation, rain-dominated river basins. These basins are more exposed to heavy rain, thus they are more susceptible to the increase in precipitation intensity that occurs as climate warms.<br/><br/>Work performed here uses an ensemble of RCM simulations, each one performed using output from a different GCM simulation, to examine the effects of global warming on the weather and climate of the PNW.  The RCM used in the study is the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, and GCM simulations are taken from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP).  The use of an ensemble allows an assessment of the sensitivity of results to differences in model formulation, and ensures that the research focuses on the robust model behaviors which are most likely to have simple physical explanations. A key concern in the research is the effect of biases on GCM projections for future climate change.  For instance the loss of snowpack has strong implications for local climate and hydrology, thus a model which incorrectly simulates snowpack in a region which is not typically snow covered will likely overestimate sensitivity to warming in that region.  The project also uses the RCM ensemble to look at the likelihood that climate change will increase the risk of wildfires in the PNW.<br/><br/>The work is of societal as well as scientific interest as much of the effort in responding to climate change occurs at the local level.  The Principal Investigators are engaged with a number of local organizations involved in planning for climate change, including the King County Department of Natural Resources, the US Forest Service, and Seattle City Light.  The project involves undergraduate students through the Bothell campus of the University of Washington, which is a primarily undergraduate institution.  It also supports a postdoctoral associate, thereby providing for the future scientific workforce in this research area.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A task that is fundamental to the operation of these systems is decentralized optimization, where participating nodes cooperate to minimize an overall objective function that is the sum (or average) of individual nodes? local objective functions. Moreover, since individual nodes? local objective functions may bear sensitive information of local nodes such as medical records in collaborative learning and user energy-consumption profiles in a smart grid, in many cases, the decentralized optimization algorithm has to make sure that a participant?s sensitive information is protected from being inferable by other participating nodes or external eavesdroppers. Although plenty of results have been proposed for decentralized optimization, most of these results do not consider the problem of privacy protection. Conventional information-technology privacy mechanisms are inappropriate for decentralized optimization because they either have to compromise the accuracy of optimization (in, e.g., differential-privacy-based approaches) or incur heavy extra computation/communication overhead (in, e.g., cryptography-based privacy approaches). The lack of effective privacy solutions for decentralized optimization not only severely hinders the social adoption of new technologies, but also leads to potential vulnerabilities since stealing private information is usually the basis for sophisticated cybersecurity attacks.  Leveraging the iterative properties of decentralized optimization algorithms, the project aims to establish a new privacy-preserving approach for decentralized optimization that neither compromises optimization accuracy nor incurs large computation/communication overhead. Combined with the additional merit of needing no assistance of a trusted central coordinator, the proposed approach is expected to transformatively advance privacy-preservation in networked systems and make impacts in many applications ranging from connected vehicles, swarm robotics, smart grid, sensor networks, to collaborative machine learning. <br/><br/>Leveraging control theory, this project seeks to establish methodologies and associated theories for inherently privacy-preserving decentralized optimization by exploiting the intrinsic dynamical properties of decentralized optimization. Besides maintaining optimization accuracy, the dynamics-based privacy approach is also free of encryption, which not only guarantees limited extra computation/communication overhead, but also promises a decentralized implementation without the assistance of any trusted third party or data aggregator. The main research thrusts are to: 1) Develop a privacy framework for dynamical systems that explicitly considers the iterative evolution of information in decentralized optimization; 2) Design perturbations to dynamics that enable privacy without affecting the accuracy of decentralized optimization methods for convex problems, and quantify the effects of the perturbations on convergence speed; 3) Investigate the influence of privacy design on decentralized non-convex optimization and exploit freedom in privacy design to facilitate decentralized non-convex problems; and 4) Evaluate the results using experiments on a multi-robot platform and connected vehicles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent advances in Drosophila research ? aided by an array of sophisticated genetically-encoded tools ? have enabled neuroscientists to understand, with cellular precision, how well-defined neuronal circuits detect sensory information and transform it to generate meaningful behaviors. These tools can be easily applied to other Drosophila species, facilitating detailed comparative studies. In this project, these advances are used to address a fundamental question in evolutionary neuroscience: why do brains increase in relative size among related species? The research outlined in this proposal will break new ground into this question by bringing a neuronal circuit perspective to this long-standing problem. The project also aims at showcasing the value of a humble fruit fly to scientific research ? and in particular in the field of neuroscience ? to the general public and to the next generation of biologists by pursuing different outreach activities that aim at increasing public awareness for the potential and importance of Drosophila research.<br/><br/>Why the brains of some species ? including our own ? grow larger and what advantages these larger brains may convey are questions is of immense interest. Drosophila pseudoobscura ? a species that diverged from D. melanogaster about 25 million years ago ? has an unusually large brain relative to its body size when compared to other Drosophila species. This size difference is immediately noticeable in the antennal lobe, an olfactory processing center: while the overall organization of the antennal lobe is largely conserved in both species, some glomeruli are three times as large as their D. melanogaster counterparts and there are two D. pseudoobscura-specific glomeruli. These observations led to two hypotheses. First, the large D. pseudoobscura antennal lobe might result from an increase in both the number of neurons associated with certain glomeruli as well as from an increase in the total number of glomeruli. Second, these differences might endow the D. pseudoobscura olfactory circuit with an increased detection bandwidth. This research project will test these hypotheses by quantifying which components of the olfactory circuit of D. pseudoobscura increase in number and by identifying the functional consequences of these quantitative changes. These results will reveal which elements of a neuronal circuit are evolutionarily malleable and how such changes affect the function of a circuit. It is possible that from these analyses fundamental rules of neuronal circuit evolution can be delineated. This research project will also lead to the formulation of specific hypotheses regarding the potential adaptive significance of changes in neuronal circuits and lay the foundation to identifying the genetic underpinnings of brain evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Significant progress in recent years has been made in understanding the distribution of iron in the oceans and the impact of iron limitation on phytoplankton. Many questions remain, however, about the extensive biogeochemical linkages that exist between iron and carbon in marine systems. Bacteria represent a crucial and understudied node in this network. The proposed work will explore linkages between the carbon and iron cycles in marine systems in the context of the heterotrophic bacteria that are the primary drivers of the turnover of organic matter in the oceans. The project will support a postdoctoral researcher, as well as undergraduate interns. UCSD Bioengineering Senior Design Thesis students will be entrained to develop projects related to synthetic biology. The team will also host a 3-day workshop, in collaboration with Scripps Educational Alliances and the San Diego County Office of Education (SDCOE), to develop Next Generation Science Standards and CA Science Framework-aligned activities and resources for high school teachers in California. Educational activities will be based on ?phenomena? associated with the proposed research, and after appropriate testing and refinement by local science teachers, will be broadly disseminated by the SDCOE. <br/><br/>A functional genomics approach will be employed, using model organisms that have been shown to represent a spectrum in terms of their carbon substrate utilization and lifestyle strategies. Alteromonas spp., with numerous TonB-dependent outer membrane receptors and hydrolytic enzyme capabilities, are known for their ability to degrade and assimilate complex (i.e. high molecular weight) marine dissolved organic matter. In contrast, well-studied Roseobacters, with large numbers of inner-membrane transporters, specialize in the transport of low- molecular-weight organic matter. This project asks fundamental questions about how iron substrate utilization and iron-related physiology contribute to the known niche specificity of these organisms and impact carbon processing. These questions will be addressed through a combination of transcriptomic, mutagenic and experimental approaches with model strains. This work aims to advance the field so that conceptual models of microbial iron recycling can be integrated with current conceptual models of organic carbon recycling by marine bacteria. In addition, the functional genomics approach proposed here will identify and validate targets for meta-omic, meta- proteomic, and bioinformatic investigations of the links between iron and carbon cycling in the ocean, enabling better interrogation of existing and planned large-scale ocean datasets such as Tara Oceans, GEOTRACES, and BioGeoSCAPES.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project combines field and lab experiments to evaluate how plant-plant and plant-microbe interactions influence the migration of creosote, one of the most common and important shrubs of the warm deserts of North America (Sonoran, Chihuahuan and Mojave), into adjacent grasslands.  The expansion of woody plants at the expense of grassland, a phenomenon called shrub encroachment, is global in scale and expected to accelerate under future warmer climates and elevated atmospheric CO2. The microbes that live in and near plant roots (the plant microbiome) likely play key roles in affecting the rate of shrub encroachment but their influence on shrub establishment and migration success has not yet been examined. To predict how plant-microbe and plant-plant (in this case shrub/grass) interactions will drive or slow plant population expansion in future climates requires evaluating the spatial and temporal scales at which these interactions occur. Using both field and lab experiments and mathematical models, this project will enable forecasts of how plant-plant and plant-microbe interactions reshape the abundance and distributions of shrub and grass species at the limits of their geographic distributions. Shrubland-grassland dynamics affect the amount of carbon stored by an ecosystem, drive rangeland management decisions, influence strategies to conserve biodiversity, and extend over 330 million hectares of North America alone. This project trains students at many levels, and builds partnerships with stakeholders and managers to ensure knowledge transfer to the benefit of society. A science-art collaboration is also embedded in the research activities, including the design and creation of 3D-printed plant models and artistic interpretations of plant morphologies. A museum exhibit of these models and microbe plant interactions will be created to expand public outreach and create an aesthetic expression of the inter-relationships of microbes and plants.<br/><br/>The proposed research will elucidate how plant root and soil associated microbes influence plant species range movements under environmental change. Research activities include the acquisition of novel quantitative data on key parameters that determine range spread: the spatial extent and temporal speed at which plants influence their microbial environment and the relative strength of the microbe/plant feedbacks compared to plant/plant competitive interactions. Experiments on field observations will determine the underlying mechanisms of plant-microbe interactions by addressing the following questions: (1) What is the spatial extent of plant-soil feedback between foundation species at ecotones where range limits collide? This question will be addressed using spatially-explicit paired field and greenhouse experiments to quantify the spatial extent of plant/microbe feedbacks as they influence both grass and shrub performance. (2) How does elevated CO2 affect microbial feedbacks and coexistence between foundation species at these ecotones? This question will be addressed using a growth chamber experiment to contrast microbial feedbacks and competition between grass and shrubs under ambient versus elevated CO2. (3) By what mechanisms do plant species cultivate unique microbial communities through time? This will be addressed with a field experiment to evaluate mechanisms underlying soil and microbial modification by plants and the temporal scale of each mechanism.  Finally, quantitative models will be developed using the data from these experiments and observations to address the question, (4) How do soil microbes contribute to range expansion, contraction, or stabilization at species range limits, and how will elevated CO2 change range limit dynamics? The project breaks new ground ni evaluating plant/soil feedbacks in a spatial and temporal context using a well-documented, ecologically important, and experimentally tractable range shift: the encroachment of C3 woody shrubs into C4 grasslands in the American Southwest.

That circulation moves water from the Southern Ocean through the tropics and all the way into the northern hemisphere.  Those waters carry nutrient chemicals that fuel the growth of phytoplankton throughout the global ocean whose photosynthetic carbon fixation is a major factor in setting how much atmospheric carbon dioxide is removed by ocean biology. Diatoms are a key group of phytoplankton involved in this process of carbon uptake and they are especially abundant in the Southern Ocean. Diatoms are unique among the phytoplankton because they need the element silicon to grow. They take the silicon (Si) that is dissolved in seawater and use it to produce a shell made of opal called a frustule. In this project we are interested in how the availability of dissolved Si, as set by the Southern Ocean, controls the distribution and abundance of diatoms in the sea and their contribution to ocean biogeochemistry such as the uptake and removal of carbon.  We will use a relatively new tool to trace diatom dynamics ? silicon isotopes. Variations in silicon isotopes in the dissolved Si in seawater and in diatom frustules can inform the level of diatom growth that has occurred in ocean waters and how diatom growth is coupled to ocean circulation and nutrient transport. The distribution of isotopes of silicon between Tahiti in the tropics to the Southern Ocean will allow us to better understand how the physics, chemistry and biology of the Southern Ocean controls diatom activity at global scales. The research will involve an early career scientist and undergraduate students at UCSB. The PIs will also reach out to regional K-12 schools through UCSB?s Research and Education Experience Facility (REEF) by developing curricula on Southern Ocean biogeochemistry and the GEOTRACES program.<br/><br/>Silicon isotopes will be measured in full ocean depth profiles along US GEOTRACES GP17OCE from Tahiti, French Polynesia to Punta Arenas, Chile. It is now clear that successful application of the Si isotope proxy in the modern ocean and for paleoclimate reconstructions requires a mechanistic understanding of how the silicon isotopic composition of ventilating waters masses varies in time and space. Our goal is to test hypotheses related to predictions from models that processes in the Southern Ocean dictate silicon isotopes distributions throughout the global ocean. That prediction arises because the Southern Ocean is the central hub of the meridional overturning circulation. The interplay between silica production in Southern Ocean surface waters, opal export and the Southern Ocean counter current meridional circulation traps silicic acid in the Southern Ocean while partitioning and redistributing Si isotopes between mode and deep waters. Heavy Si isotopes are distilled out of the Southern Ocean in relatively shallow mode waters while light isotopes ride the northward flow of deep waters. Individual aspects of these predictions have been examined previously; however, measurements of Si isotopes in GP17OCE will provide the first section that samples all relevant water masses synoptically. Those distributions together with other data collected on GP17OCE will allow a more comprehensive evaluation of these mechanisms partitioning Si isotopes in the Southern Ocean and their redistribution in the overturning circulation more globally.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research will also have an impact on real-world applications in large-scale data centers, manufacturing, telecommunications, healthcare, inventory, and service systems, providing skills and tools to manage them effectively. Such systems can often be modeled as a stochastic network, with multiple jobs and many servers, and complex network topology. The operations and management of these sophisticated networked systems are subject to many risk factors under various random environments. This research will develop advanced methods and algorithms to provide solutions that mitigate the potential operational risks in a large-scale network model system. The model system roughly describes the system dynamics in large-scale parallel server networks. The research will provide approximate optimal scheduling and other operational policies. Risk-sensitive control has the advantage of achieving good performance in the presence of disturbances and uncertainty. It also limits large fluctuations since it penalizes higher moments of the running cost. The investigators will incorporate their findings into the existing graduate courses in stochastic networks and control, and disseminate them through seminars on relevant research topics. The research involves a team of interdisciplinary researchers, including those from underrepresented minority groups, and provides training opportunities for graduate students with new mathematical skills. <br/><br/>The objectives of the research are: (1) To develop a comprehensive theoretical framework for the study of eigenvalues of elliptic systems and integro-differential operators to address the associated problems in infinite-horizon risk sensitive control (IHRS) of regime-switching and jump diffusions. (2) To develop the techniques required to establish asymptotic optimality and study the associated stochastic differential games and large deviation characterizations. (3) To study the large-time asymptotic behavior and relative value iteration algorithms, which form the basis of rolling horizon control and reinforcement learning methods. This research will greatly advance the theory of eigenvalues of integro-differential operators and elliptic systems and produce ground-breaking methodologies for risk-sensitive control of diffusions (with jumps) and regime-switching diffusions. On the analytical side, this research will greatly contribute to the current efforts in the literature concerning nonlinear eigenvalue problems in unbounded domains. A wealth of results on variational characterizations, maximum and large deviation principles, and the associated Feynman-Kac semigroup for nonsymmetric operators are expected to be obtained.  Another important contribution of the proposed research is analyzing large-time asymptotic behavior, which includes the study of relative value iteration algorithms and rolling horizon control. The research will also advance the understanding of the risk-sensitive asymptotically optimal scheduling policies for large-scale parallel server networks, including those in random environments that give rise to jump-diffusion and regime-switching diffusion limits. New methods involving the equivalent stochastic differential game and spatial truncation techniques will be developed to prove lower and upper bounds for asymptotic optimality.

Beyond simply storing data, one increasingly common requirement is to store activity data, also known as log data, which describe things that happen rather than things that are. Activity data are generated by computing systems, scientific instruments, electrical devices, etc. as well as by humans. The fast growing of activity data stresses current data management systems beyond their capability and becomes a known killer performance bottleneck of high-performance computing systems. This project develops ChronoLog, a novel system for organizing and storing activity data effectively and efficiently. ChronoLog leverages modern storage hardware and provides user-focused plugins and easy-to-use interface for productivity. It will benefit a diverse range of communities in various ways, such as enabling better fraud detection in financial transactions, faster and more accurate weather predictions and simulations, reduced time-to-insight for medical and bioengineering data, autonomous computing (e.g., driving), and more secure web and mobile services. <br/><br/>ChronoLog uses physical time to provide a synchronization-free data distribution and the total ordering on a log. It first leverages multiple storage tiers, such as storage-class memories (e.g., 3D XPoint) and new flash storage (e.g., NVMe SSDs), to transparently scale the log via log auto-tiering. It then adopts a tunable parallel access model, which offers multiple-writers-multiple-readers (MWMR) semantics and highly concurrent I/O, to fully utilize the multi-tiered storage environment. ChronoLog's innovative design supports high-performance data access via I/O isolation between tails and historical operations, efficient resource utilization with newly developed elastic storage capabilities, and scalability using a novel 3D log distribution. It facilitates data processing pipelining by acting as an authoritative source of strong consistency and with the help of fast append and commit semantics. It can be used as an arbitrator offering a plethora of features such as transactional isolation and atomicity, a consensus engine for consistent replication and indexing services, and a scalable data integration and warehousing solution. ChronoLog and its plugins establish a robust, flexible, and high-performance storage ecosystem that promotes the development of scalable applications and services for high performance computing systems. The project includes a diverse group of collaborators who share a common need for a fundamentally new approach to distributed logging to address their use cases. These close partnerships will strengthen the bonds between academic and applied science, ultimately leading to new applications and driving discovery in domains as diverse as geoscience, cosmology, and astrophysics. Forming these collaborations and integrating students and junior IT professionals will create a well-trained workforce in cyberinfrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Prairie and meadow voles provide an ideal opportunity to home in on such changes in brain function. While these two species live in the same areas, have evolved from a common ancestor, and share many physical characteristics, they exhibit strikingly different social behaviors. Prairie voles form life long pair bonds while meadow voles are promiscuous. In this CAREER award the PI uses observational approaches and manipulations to ask how differences in brain activity in response to interactions with mating partners contribute to these species-level differences in behavior. In addition to answering a key question in biology, the implementation of new experimental approaches in voles, previously limited to mice, facilitates investigation of questions that are beyond the scope of more traditional laboratory animals. The research activities provide genuine research experiences and training in advanced neuroscience techniques for undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, incorporation of the project?s results in existing undergraduate coursework enhances interdisciplinary STEM education. The formation of a Pathway to PhD program provides transformative research experiences and opportunities for advancement in STEM for students at a local Hispanic-serving institution. <br/><br/>Social behavior can differ dramatically even between closely related species, and species-appropriate social behavior is critical for survival and reproduction. The mechanisms that enable this diversity remain largely unexamined at the level of neuronal encoding. For instance, how do experience-dependent patterns of neuronal activity differ across species to produce vast differences in monogamy versus promiscuity even in the face of similar social experiences, such as mating? The goal of this proposal is to identify the neuronal basis of social attachment by leveraging differences in pair bonding in monogamous and promiscuous voles. The PI uses orthogonal imaging and functional approaches to test the hypothesis that species differences in pair bonding in microtine voles result from differences in the encoding of social attachment in mesolimbic reward circuits, and not in brain regions that encode social memory. Specifically, we compare and manipulate neural ensemble stability across two social brain regions in two species to illuminate the cellular and systems-level controls of complex sociocognitive behaviors. The PI?s passion for social neuroscience, comparative research, outreach, and education is also harnessed to strengthen interdisciplinary and applied STEM education by training undergraduate and graduate students in cutting-edge neuroscience techniques. Advances from these studies are being incorporated into existing courses at CU Boulder via a Pathway to PhD program for students at a local Hispanic-serving institution.

The central hypothesis is that sustainable and resilient infrastructure to manage water supply and flooding in coastal areas requires informed decisions aimed at (i) enhancing sustainability by balancing the local water budget through decentralization and (ii) enhancing resilience against compound flooding in which precipitation may coincide with other inundation sources. Projections of SLR impacts increasingly will need to consider the flooding associated with the interconnections between SLR and shallow coastal aquifers, as well as expected compound flooding under typical precipitation events. Therefore, this project will establish a mechanistic framework to analyze important stressors to water infrastructure, with a focus on disadvantaged communities, and it will develop a decentralized model to enhance their sustainability and resilience.<br/><br/>The project aims to systematically understand the impacts of frequent and longer timescale flooding events on water infrastructure systems, and explore the sustainability benefits of decentralized infrastructure to mitigate the compound inundation impacts in which precipitation coincides with other inundation sources. The project team will employ a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) technique and couple it with distributed hydrologic modeling informed by groundwater table observations. A comprehensive LCA framework will be informed by merging approaches from hydrology and data sciences to forecast the response of water infrastructure systems to future climate change stressors. Because the success of decentralized systems heavily relies on understanding barriers that communities face in system implementation and operation, this project seeks to advance sustainability assessment of infrastructure by incorporating the needs of communities. Additionally, the project team aims to actively engage students from underrepresented groups through recruiting programs with Maximizing Access to Research Careers (MARC) and the Initiative for Maximizing Student Development (IMSD) at San Diego State University (SDSU), an Hispanic Serving Institution (HSI).

Iyengar of Indiana University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program in the Division of Chemistry. Many problems at the forefront of energy, environmental and biological research demand the quantum mechanical treatment of electrons and nuclei, but the detailed quantum-mechanical description of such problems is much too complex even in today?s high performance computing environments. This is because the computational complexity in these problems grows exponentially with system size, which makes them intractable. Iyengar and his research group are developing new computational methods to address these issues. These methods are based on a mathematical idea called graph-theory that allows Iyengar and co-workers to partition a molecular system into regions that communicate through an idea called electron correlation. This is very similar to Google maps, where cities are connected through highways, and in the same way, in Iyengar?s formalism molecular domains are connected through similar roads and bridges that provide pathways for electrons to communicate through a concept called electron correlation. Unfortunately, while electron correlation allows electrons to communicate and has a critical role in all chemical processes, this concept is also responsible for the catastrophic computational complexity of obtaining accurate molecular properties. By creating such graph-theoretic methods, Iyengar will help to reduce the computational complexity of these problems, to allow state of art calculations. These methods are poised to have major impact on the study of a wide class of problems in fields ranging from enzymology to atmospheric chemistry to materials science,  including the study of hydrogen transfer in polymer electrolyte fuel cells. In addition, the methods are also poised to allow innovative implementations on a mixed set of hybrid quantum and classical computing systems. The methods being developed by Iyengar are at the intersection of modern computational quantum chemistry and chemical physics. Hence students in the group have the opportunity to learn and develop new theoretical methods and apply these methods to important problems. The results, involving computer codes as well as novel scientific ideas are to be disseminated to the scientific community. Specifically, the computer programs developed by Iyengar will appear as part of the NSF-funded SEAGrid science gateway. Furthermore, as a member of the quantum science center at Indiana University, and as the director of the university-wide scientific computing program, Iyengar will be involved in the organization of summer workshops for middle- and high-school teachers from the local Bloomington, Indiana area to provide cross-disciplinary training in chemistry, physics and computer science. These workshops will focus on the quantum nature of matter, providing a unified treatment of problems in physics, chemistry and biochemistry; furthermore, modeling these problems is then to be done through connections to computational algorithms. Through involvement in the Holland Hudson Scholars Program (HHSP) and the Indiana Louis Stokes Alliance for Minority Participation (LSAMP) program, the PI will work to recruit students from under-represented groups. <br/><br/>Ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) is appealing, since it does not need a priori fitted potentials. This allows application of AIMD as a self-contained black box. But this advantage is deeply affected by the cost of evaluating the electronic potential and forces. Hence, most applications of AIMD are limited to density functional theoretic (DFT) treatment. While there has been substantial progress in developing accurate DFT functionals, fundamental challenges remain. This proposal deals with the development and application of on-the-fly graph-theoretic techniques to compute accurate, low-scaling AIMD trajectories that are in agreement with post-Hartree-Fock electronic structure, but at the cost of DFT. These developments are applicable for both cluster studies as well as periodic condensed phase problems, such as reactions on surfaces. In addition, during a single AIMD step, the approach can integrate multiple electronic structure packages. Current capabilities include the ability to use Gaussian, ORCA, Psi4, Quantum Espresso and OpenMX within a single AIMD umbrella. There are three specific aims in this proposal: (1) to implement the team's graph theory-based approach in an asynchronous fashion on novel hybrid, interleaved, quantum/classical computing hardware. This will allow the steep scaling aspects of our method to be treated on quantum hardware, the lower scaling aspects and graph-theoretic decomposition of molecular structure on classical hardware and provide a new thrust for studying reactive chemical problems; (2) to study hydrogen transfer reactions on the surface of water. The systems studied are in the condensed phase, and of critical importance in atmospheric chemistry. The reactions considered deal with isoprene-based hydroxy-peroxy radicals, thought to be pivotal on hydroxyl radical concentrations in the atmosphere. (3) The graph theory-based approach will be used to construct multi-dimensional potential surfaces for hydrogen-transfer reactions to gauge quantum nuclear effects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogen atoms can tunnel through the lattice of molecular hydrogen according to quantum mechanics. At low enough temperatures and high enough densities, the hydrogen atoms embedded in the lattice of molecular hydrogen have quantum overlap which can lead to a phenomenon called Bose-Einstein condensation, in which individual atoms lose their identities and the whole system behaves like a single quantum wave. This leads to superfluid properties such as flow without friction. A goal of this research is to study hydrogen atoms in solid molecular hydrogen at the lowest temperatures to look for Bose-Einstein condensation and subsequent superfluid behavior of hydrogen atoms embedded in solid molecular hydrogen. If successful, this project could initiate a new field in condensed matter physics and benefit chemists studying chemical reactions. A second goal is the observation of superfluidity in the collection of molecular para-hydrogen clusters as another demonstration of Bose-Einstein condensation. Graduate students get extensive training in techniques used to attain temperatures well below 1 K. Active outreach programs including lectures, meetings with high school teachers and demonstrations are performed during the Texas A&M University Physics Festival. The project also maintains the international collaboration with the low temperature group in Finland.<br/><br/>Technical description: <br/>This research project pursues the fundamental goal of observing new quantum phenomena in a system of hydrogen atoms embedded in solid molecular hydrogen films. These hydrogen atoms remain delocalized even at temperatures below 1K and may exhibit Bose-Einstein condensation and supersolidity if cooled to low enough temperatures. This work involves a dilution refrigerator combined with a Pomeranchuk cooling stage to cool the samples of hydrogen atoms in solid molecular hydrogen down to 1 mK, where new quantum phenomena is expected to occur. The hydrogen atom ground state population and possible onset of Bose-Einstein condensation can be probed by using 128 GHz electron spin resonance techniques. The recent discovery of the nuclear polarized phases of hydrogen atoms in solid molecular hydrogen films at T=0.1-0.8 K implies possible quantum transitions. Extending the experiments to lower temperatures should help throw light on the origin of these phases and their possible relation to hydrogen atom Bose-Einstein condensation. Additionally, studies are in progress of hydrogen atom spatial quantum diffusion in solid molecular hydrogen which allows determination of hydrogen atom effective mass and estimation of the onset temperature for Bose-Einstein condensation. The second goal of the project is the search for hydrogen superfluidity in macroscopic samples containing a large number of small para-hydrogen clusters. Superfluidity of single small para-hydrogen clusters encapsulated in helium nanodroplets was observed experimentally at 0.15 K. The search for superfluidity of para-hydrogen molecules is performed for a collection of small para-hydrogen clusters embedded in porous solid neon films grown on the surface of a quartz microbalance. The onset of superfluidity in para-hydrogen clusters is registered as a microbalance frequency change while passing through the transition temperature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports theoretical research into such phenomena in dots made of lead sulfide, lead selenide, or lead telluride, the so-called lead chalcogenides.  The distribution of possible electronic energies in a quantum dot depends on size, shape, and composition; tuning these parameters will permit applications in photovoltaics, optoelectronics, quantum information technologies, and medicine. Lead chalcogenide quantum dots are unique because they can be used in devices operating in the near-infrared and mid-infrared frequency ranges employed in telecommunications and medical imaging.  Optical properties of these quantum dots are determined by particles called excitons, each consisting of a negatively charged electron and a positively charged empty state, or hole, where an electron should have been.  At low resolution, many different exciton states share the same energy. However, competing interactions split the energies, so that different exciton states take different energy values.  Being able to predict how these splittings depend on shape and size is key to engineering quantum dots for desired purposes.  This research will be carried out at Jackson State University and will contribute to development of the science, technology, engineering, and math workforce at a historically Black university that primarily serves educational needs of local minority students.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical investigation of the exciton fine structure in lead chalcogenide quantum dots and its manifestation in optical phenomena. Description of band-edge exciton states in lead chalcogenide quantum dots comes up against fundamental complexity stemming from the fact that extrema of conduction and valence bands in bulk lead chalcogenides occur at four inequivalent L points of the Brillouin zone. In lead chalcogenide quantum dots, electron-hole exchange interaction and intervalley coupling split the otherwise 64-fold valley- and spin-degenerate ground exciton state into several groups of closely spaced states giving rise to a large intrinsic broadening of the photoluminescence spectral lines. Furthermore, an exciton effectively couples to confined optical and acoustic phonon modes. This results in complex photoluminescence spectral line-shapes which can be directly observed by means of single-dot spectroscopy. Additional information can be obtained from polarized photoluminescence measurements in external magnetic fields. This project aims to model lead chalcogenide quantum dots within the empirical tight-binding and effective-mass methods in order to provide theoretical description of physical processes underlying this kind of experiment. The effects of various perturbations and their interplay will be studied in order to gain control over the exciton fine structure through the control over the quantum dot shape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, programming skills are in high demand across all sectors of the economy. While enrollments in university computer science (CS) courses are growing rapidly, many students struggle to learn programming and retention in the major is low. Learning to program requires mastering practices like problem-solving, systematic debugging, and adaptive planning. However, rising enrollments in CS classes make it difficult for instructors to monitor student practices and provide feedback. Given that a student?s programming process cannot be determined from the final solution, instructors rarely have visibility into students? programming practices. This project leverages a unique opportunity to observe and support the programming process automatically and aims to advance scientific understanding of the programming process by building intelligent programming environments that assess and adapt to students? motivations and practices. As a CAREER project, it employs integrated education and outreach efforts, to develop the theoretical and technical foundations needed to develop and disseminate intelligent learning environments that effectively support the practice of programming.<br/><br/>This CAREER project explores and addresses core challenges in promoting effective programming practices in introductory CS courses. The PI?s prior work reveals that students often use programming practices as signals of whether they are performing well. For example, many students believe that planning and looking up syntax are signs of low ability, even though experts consider these practices a natural part of programming. Furthermore, these self-assessments have been shown to impact self-efficacy, or a student?s belief in their ability to succeed. These findings introduce two core challenges. First, students? inaccurate expectations about programming may lead them to avoid effective expert practices. Second, students may develop low self-efficacy when they engage in these practices, a factor that can impact course performance and the decision to major in CS. This project proposes a general approach and set of techniques to address these challenges by (1) developing behavioral models that automatically detect programming practices to enable a large-scale study of student motivations and practices, and (2) designing and evaluating interventions that provide personalized guidance to help students develop motivation and effective practices. The proposed education plan will expand the impact of the research through (1) online workshops for CS instructors that focus on student motivation and practices, (2) new courses for graduate students who plan to become CS instructors, and (3) research opportunities for students who are underrepresented in CS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is a fundamental mismatch between the capabilities of traditionally designed servers and the dynamic requirements of modern applications. This mismatch leads to poor utilization and significant waste of resources. A new way to design datacenters, called the disaggregated approach, can address this problem by creating a need-based on-demand model for computing. Here, servers are specialized to perform specific functions, and applications use only those specialized servers that best perform the functions needed by each application. While the disaggregated approach improves utilization and makes datacenters easier to manage, it comes at a performance cost: disaggregation requires applications to access critical resources spread across a set of specialized servers over the datacenter network. To mitigate such challenges of resource disaggregation, this project designs HardLambda, a new Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) abstraction that brings the functional and hardware requirements of an application together in a unified fashion. HardLambda enables datacenters to allocate resources in ways that best meet application needs while retaining the resource utilization and management flexibility of disaggregated hardware. The designed algorithms and system software will enable scalable control and sharing of disaggregated resources, and create new approaches to adaptive resource allocation. <br/><br/>HardLambda will make disaggregated datacenters a viable and sustainable option for numerous applications in science and industry. The project especially targets machine and deep learning (ML/DL) applications due to their increasingly crucial role in many aspects of modern computing-powered life. At the same time, HardLambda will improve the sustainability of large-scale datacenters, where high utilization, efficiency, and continuous adaptation to application requirements are all essential factors. The research will create new knowledge on hardware and software co-designed FaaS systems and services, and yield insights for efficiently supporting ML/DL applications at extremely large scales. The project will engage with partners in industry and national research laboratories to deploy HardLambda in real systems and will undertake educational and broadening participation activities to improve community awareness and understanding of the scaling and sustainability challenges of large-scale computing infrastructure. Special emphasis will be given to engaging students from underrepresented groups in the research and educational activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These molecules can be small and non-specific, such as highly reactive radicals, or they can be large and more targeted, such as enzymes. The ability to sense which degradative molecules are present through simple bench top assays would enable more efficient characterization of disease states such as cancer or inflammation. This project will therefore study the degradation behavior of peptoids, a class of synthetic molecules that offers the potential to degrade selectively one type of biomolecule (radical species) but not another (enzymes). This selectivity will enable the design of peptoid-based sensors to non-invasively identify which degradative molecules are present in a biological environment, and this knowledge will also impact the design of new materials with well-defined degradation properties for use in biomedical implants. The proposed project will also include educational and outreach activities at the high school, undergraduate, and graduate student level to broaden the participation of diverse groups in biomaterials research. Specifically, it will develop a mentoring program to facilitate interactions among students from underrepresented populations in STEM at the annual Texas Biomaterials Day. <br/><br/>Technical Summary <br/><br/>Reactive oxygen/nitrogen species (ROS/RNS) and matrix metalloproteases (MMPs) are critical drivers of extracellular matrix remodeling, especially during disease and inflammation. Degradable peptides and proteins are commonly exploited as ROS and MMP sensors; however, a key challenge is cross-reactivity and limited selectivity toward one type of degradative species. Non-natural peptoids (or N-substituted glycines) offer an attractive platform with which to address these limitations due to their proteolytically-stable N-substituted polyamide backbone and potential selective susceptibility to ROS/RNS. In addition, peptoids preserve the monomer sequence definition of biomolecules but utilize an expanded class of side chain functionalities, which may access higher specificity to MMP degradation in hybrid substrates. The proposed research activities will combine synthesis with mass spectrometry and new degradation assays to: 1) define the selectivity and sensitivity of non-natural peptoids toward biologically relevant oxidative mechanisms of degradation, 2) determine monomer sequence effects on the specificity of hybrid substrate degradation by MMPs, and 3) assess peptoid-based biomaterials as platforms to simultaneously detect mixtures of ROS and MMPs. These studies will lead to fundamental insights regarding peptoid degradation behavior in complex biological environments and enable the development of peptoid-based sensors and materials for applications in tissue engineering, disease modeling, and diagnostic screening. In addition, the proposed educational activities will establish a new mentoring program to enhance the participation of students from Minority Serving Institutions and Historically Black Colleges and Universities in Texas at the annual Texas Biomaterials Day. Best practices from this mentoring program will be shared via webinar to facilitate the broad implementation of similar programs at the nine other Biomaterials Days across the country.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Islands provide an excellent setting in which to study speciation in wild populations due to their discrete geography and well-characterized geologic record. The Indo-Pacific, from Southeast Asia to Polynesia, is the cradle of speciation theory and home to numerous geographic radiations of widespread, rapidly evolving species complexes. This project will synthesize genomics and state-of-the-art trait datasets to reveal processes that promote rapid radiations in nature. Specifically, it will use a widespread, species-rich genus of island kingfishers (Aves: Todiramphus) as its study system. This project aims to make broadly applicable and generalizable predictions about the speciation process. The outcomes of this project will be a model for future speciation research in the Pacific and serve as a springboard for pioneering new ways of studying complex phenotypes and their interactions with nature. This project will engage the public through virtual and face-to-face experiences. The researchers will create virtual collections experiences (VCEs) that highlight the associated natural history collections at the Museum of Southwestern Biology and The Field Museum. These online tools will reveal how data are collected from specimens and used to address the project?s research objectives. The VCEs will be developed as education modules for grades 9?12, complete with lesson plans and student learning outcomes. The researchers will development a highly multisensory exhibit at The Field Museum, playing on the project?s themes of color evolution that will reach an estimated 500,000 people in Chicago.

This project proposes an integrative study of systematics, biogeography, plumage diversification, and ecological adaptation to test multiple hypotheses of the factors that promoted rapid diversification in a diverse and widespread radiation of island kingfishers. Todiramphus kingfishers occur across the entire Indo-Pacific and their diversification rate rivals those of ?classic? adaptive radiations. This study system provides replicated instances of sympatry and isolation, as well as divergent ecologies required for a synthetic study of diversification. The project will generate diverse datasets including whole genomes, ecological niche models, and phenotypic traits, to study how these factors facilitated rapid radiation on islands over the last 10 million years. The proposed research will leverage this unique geographic context to provide novel insights into the multifaceted process of speciation by (a) quantifying the presence and extent of gene flow and how novel changes in genomic architecture influenced diversification; (b) assessing how extrinsic traits (plumage coloration, biogeography, and relative niche conservatism) promoted or inhibited species divergence in the clade; and (c) through a novel test of the abundance-niche-center hypothesis in the context of genomic and phenotypic diversity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To realize these applications, tuning the magnetic properties of these materials is an ultimate goal of physics and materials science research. A rapidly evolving research area, controlling and manipulating the magnetic properties of quantum magnets using light, has just begun. The goal of this project is to use external light as a control parameter to drive quantum magnetic phases, to advance our knowledge and understanding, and to control the emergent phases. In this project, photoexcitation across broad time-scales (seconds to femtoseconds) is used to control and manipulate the magnetic properties of these new classes of materials. Outreach activities train army personnel and veterans at Fort Bliss and White Sands Missile Range in the El Paso region. This project further provides research and peer-coaching opportunities as well as professional development seminars to further foster education in STEM fields in UTEP, which is predominantly (81%) a Hispanic serving institute. <br/><br/>Technical:  <br/><br/>Newly discovered (quasi) two-dimensional (2D) van der Waals (vdW) magnets show unexpected magnetic properties (monolayer ferromagnetism, giant second harmonic generation, etc.,) associated with the reduced dimension, which has generated a great deal of excitement in the recent past.  Previous works have shown that electric field, electrostatic doping, external pressure, and mixed halide chemistry can control the magnetic properties of these materials. Unlike the above approaches, ultrafast photoexcitation is known to control and manipulate the magnetic properties of materials much more rapidly and effectively which allows developing light controlled spin electronics.  Previous researchers have measured the magnetic properties of these layered materials using light. However, controlling and manipulating their magnetic properties using light has largely been unexplored. The main objective of this research is to establish a comprehensive fundamental scientific knowledge and understanding in controlling and manipulating the magnetic behavior of vdW materials upon photoexcitation. Of specific importance, the two main goals of this combined experimental and theoretical effort are to (a) study the magnetic properties in quasi-2D and 2D CrX3 upon photoexcitation, and to (b) gain in-depth understanding on magnetic exchange interactions and 2D correlations near magnetic order in quasi-2D CrX3 alter upon photoexcitation. This effort has the potential to be extended to other emerging vdW magnetic metals, both at the quasi-2D and true 2D limit.

Neurons communicate with electrical signals and the release of neurotransmitters across the microscopic space of a synapse. We have recently documented a combination of these two signaling systems, one example of which is estrogen synthesis at the synapse (SES). However, we know little about how electrical and hormonal signaling interact at the synapse, or how this SES may affect complex behaviors like memory function. Neither do we know if learning affects SES. We will use the zebra finch, a species with abundant SES to understand how synaptic steroid synthesis interacts with membrane electrical activity and neurotransmitter release. Then, we will ask how SES modulates learning, storage and recall of newly learned spatial information. Lastly, we will probe changes in the genome associated with learning, memory, and SES. The investigators on this project are all committed to undergraduate education and extend research opportunities to students and area high school teachers, thereby increasing outreach at local institutions. The PI will host a streaming video show highlighting the interactions between healthy food preparation and hormonal change. Finally, we will provide content on the physiological and vocal changes to LBGT+ choruses and choirs on the effects of hormone therapy on vocal performance. These outreach activities are designed to exploit the researchers? scholarly, outreach, and public engagement to increase the awareness of scientific research to a diverse set of citizens. <br/><br/>Synaptocrine signaling, evidenced by steroid synthesis at the synapse may be a signaling system that combines paracrine and electrical signaling. The abundant synaptic aromatase in the finch brain makes it an invaluable model in understanding the interplay between electrical activity and steroid provision. Further, the accessibility of the avian hippocampus (HP), the plentiful synaptic aromatase therein, and its established role in spatial memory, allow for an unparalleled opportunity to understand the role of synaptocrine aromatization in memory formation and performance. We propose to use biochemical, behavioral, and genomic techniques to understand how: ionic flux affects hormone synthesis and neurotransmitter release at the synapse, how aromatization in the HP affects components of memory function, and how changes in the hippocampal transcriptome are altered by aromatization and learning. This proposal combines the skills of researchers at two predominantly undergraduate institutions, all of whom are committed to academic and public education. The PIs will welcome high school teachers and undergraduates into their laboratories for summer internships and will design and implement a new course in Neuroanatomy for undergraduates in Neuroscience. Public outreach will consist of a streaming cooking show that discusses the endocrinology and physiological consequences of healthy food preparation.

Proposal IOS-2047684<br/><br/>Title: CAREER: Hidden drivers of parasitism and symbiosis in the rhizosphere<br/><br/>This project focuses on plant-parasitic nematodes, tiny worms that feed on plants, causing an estimated 25% of crop yield loss globally and costing $100 billion annually. Naturally occurring bacteria have been discovered living within these worms that may drive their survival and direct their devastating impacts on plants. These bacteria, present in some of the most damaging nematodes, are related to bacteria currently used to control mosquito-borne diseases, suggesting they may hold promise for agricultural control strategies that reduce the use of toxic chemicals to control nematodes. This project uses global sampling, DNA and RNA sequencing, computer software development, and novel experiments to uncover the function of these widespread bacteria and bridge traditionally separated fields of plant pathology, nematology, and microbiology to overcome significant roadblocks to understanding rhizosphere ecology. This project also examines how stressors such as climate change and land use affect the interactions between these bacteria, nematodes, and plants. This project will have societal and educational impacts through integrating research activities performed by an interdisciplinary science program in bioinformatics at the hosting Hispanic Serving Institution with national research-outreach programs centered on citizen science and rhizosphere biomodelling, and a local peer-mentoring program in genomics for high school students targeting traditionally underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Plant-parasitic nematodes (PPNs) are ubiquitous in soils, causing significant losses to agricultural crops and impacts on plants across terrestrial ecosystems. Recent work shows these nematodes host bacterial endosymbionts, including Wolbachia and Cardinium, which are well-known in insects to play a critical role in driving their host?s biology as either reproductive parasites or mutualists. Yet, the role of these endosymbionts in PPNs is unknown. This CAREER project seeks to uncover the dynamics driving the tripartite interactions between these endosymbionts, PPNs, and plants. Research activities will (1) determine the ecological and evolutionary forces acting on PPN endosymbionts globally across natural populations through shotgun metagenomics, population genomics, database mining, and bioinformatics; (2) directly test endosymbiont impacts on host nematode fitness, phenotype, and plant parasitism through symbiont-clearing experiments on root-cultures, plants, and transparent soils, using host-symbiont gene expression analysis; and (3) investigate the dual effects of PPN endosymbionts and stressors such as climate and land use change using computational models and transplanted plant communities under temperature stress. These experiments will test the hypothesis that PPN endosymbionts drive the tripartite dynamics through controlling host reproduction or providing iron/heme or lipids and explore molecular targets for biocontrol. The project integrates research, education, and outreach objectives by developing and incorporating Citizen Science-based sampling, an undergraduate Bioinformatics Challenge program, and a summer high school Genomics Scholar program to engage and train underrepresented groups in this research. Outcomes are expected to form a new foundational understanding of these rhizosphere interactions, generate bioinformatics software, and improve training in multi-omics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While these conditions have tended to be stable for long periods of time, vast changes are now taking place. Some peatlands have been drained for agriculture or forestry. Others will become warmer and drier in a warming climate. What happens to all the stored C when peatlands are drained or dry up? The answer to this complex question requires understanding the impacts of changes in vegetation, tree growth and peat decomposition below ground through interactions with fungi and other microorganisms.  This project will use a large-scale experimental set-up to study the changes that take place underground as peatland soils are drained and trees begin to colonize. Experiments will test how changes in the below ground fungal community accompanying tree roots will impact retention and decomposition of stored C and its potential release into the atmosphere as greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane. Increased retention of peat C would potentially help mitigate global warming while release of greenhouse gases could result in even greater, faster warming. In the course of conducting the research this project will also afford training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students and outreach to high school teachers and students.<br/><br/>Peatlands store about 1/3 of soil C globally in 1/30th of the Earth's land area. Peatland C is vulnerable to oxidation as a result of climate change or water drainage. Peatland C stocks are generally protected under saturated conditions. However many peatlands will become drier in a warming climate. While it is generally assumed that drier conditions will increase decomposition, there are potential feedbacks that lead to major uncertainty in how long-term drying will alter the trajectory of decomposition. For example, drier conditions have been shown to favor the encroachment of woody plant communities in peatlands, which may result in changes in decomposition rates. Changes in the fungal community associated with different plant functional groups (ectomycorrhizal trees, Ericaceae, sedges) are particularly important in mediating changes in decomposition, yet our understanding of how these different fungal groups influence decomposition in situ is rudimentary. The overarching goal of this project is to understand the countervailing effects of woody plant encroachment and long-term drainage on  aerobic and anaerobic decomposition in peatlands. Experiments will test two key hypotheses: i) tree encroachment will increase decomposition in drained peatlands as a function of the extracellular enzyme suite of the ectomycorrhizal fungal (EcMF) community; and ii) divergent fungal decomposer pathways and drainage histories will generate peat with differing capacity for donating and accepting electrons under anaerobic conditions. A three-way full factorial experiment will use large, intact peat pedons in a climate controlled mesocosm facility, manipulating peat drainage history, water table position, and tree presence. This will be paralleled by a field experiment in which tree root access will be manipulated over a drainage gradient. The mesocosm approach is the key to this study, so that drainage history and water tables can be manipulated, thus disentangling short- and long-term impacts of changing hydrology. The field experiment will anchor results of the mesocosm manipulations with conditions in the natural environment. Through this and detailed characterization of fungal community functional changes and consequent effects on oxidative enzymes, decomposition,  peat chemistry, and ""redox pumping"" in peat, the project will provide mechanistic insight into the long-term stability of peat in response to altered hydrology. Undergraduate and graduate student training will be integral to the research goals, and the students will help communicate results to high school students and teachers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Metallic nanoparticles have been found to be useful for many applications, such as for destroying cancer cells in our bodies, enhancing the imaging of human organs, catalyzing chemical reactions to reduce unwanted byproducts, improving the performance of paints and coatings, and fabricating nanoscale electronic devices and photovoltaic cell components. In each of these cases, nanoparticles of application-specific shape are required. Surfactants (soap-like substances) tend to attach strongly and pack densely on to metal surfaces. This enables the synthesis of metallic nanoparticles of a desired shape when surfactants are attached to specified surface regions of the growing nanocrystal to control the relative growth rates of its facets. Attached surfactants also influence how these nanoparticles cluster together to form ordered arrangements, a key enabler of nanomanufacturing processes. Currently, there are significant gaps in our understanding of surfactant/metallic nanoparticle interactions that have stymied progress in the envisioned applications. Part of the difficulty lies in the extremely small size of nanoparticles, putting the observation of many of the processes at work out of reach of experimental studies. Another challenge lies in the sheer number of factors that affect the attachment and packing of surfactants on metallic nanoparticles. In this work, we will use computer models to perform a systematic study of how surfactants of different chemical makeup attach to different faces of metallic nanoparticles. In this project, computer models will probe the behavior of the systems at the length-scale of a molecule, thus providing a detailed understanding of these dynamic processes, making it possible to optimize nanoparticle growth conditions for the desired applications. This research will be accompanied by a significant educational component. An educational strategy-based computer game will be created for middle and high school students to guide them towards STEM-based fields. Elements of the research will be incorporated in the teaching curriculum, and educational outreach activities will be performed to engage members of the Appalachian region of Ohio.<br/><br/>The overall research objective of this CAREER project is to develop a fundamental understanding of the interactions between metallic nanoparticles (MNPs) and surfactant molecules in aqueous media using molecular simulation. MNPs have increasingly attracted interest owing to their unique electrical, thermal, and optical properties, and have found applications in bioimaging, drug delivery, molecular sensors, nanofabrication, photothermal therapy, and heterogeneous catalysis. These diverse technological applications often involve the interactions of MNPs with surfactants. Due to their strong affinity towards metal-water interfaces, surfactants adsorb at these interfaces in high-density ordered morphologies. These surface structures are stabilized by hydrophobic interactions between the alkyl tails of surfactants as well as the strong polar head-metal interactions. Straightforward molecular dynamics simulations have been unsuccessful in studying these morphologies because of the kinetic barriers associated with their formation. In this research, we will employ novel free energy estimation strategies in molecular simulation to study the thermodynamic stability of the adsorption morphologies of surfactants on the facets of MNPs in a range of shapes and sizes. We will develop rare-event sampling techniques to identify the molecular processes involved in the formation of these morphologies over timescales relevant to nucleation processes. Finally, to understand how the adsorption morphologies affect the interfacial properties of MNPs, we will study surfactant-mediated aggregation of MNPs via molecular simulations. The PI is invested in several educational objectives that are closely tied to the research. To increase motivation and curiosity among middle and high school students for the STEM fields, the PI plans to develop an educational strategy-based computer game which will require a player to make engineering and economic decisions in simulated scenarios, including the use of surfactants to reduce petroleum pipeline corrosion. The PI already has developed an initial version of the software and tested it on an initial cohort of students. The PI will work closely with a local high school to enlighten students about the STEM fields through various activities, including engaging the students in STEM-related discussions and inviting them to visit the experimental and computational research groups at Ohio University. Educational outreach activities will be performed to engage members of the Appalachian region of Ohio. The PI will incorporate aspects of the research stemming from this CAREER program into curriculum development at graduate and undergraduate levels, and will recruit undergraduate students, especially those from underrepresented sections, for research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Central to most thermo-electric energy conversion and water purification technologies are liquid-vapor phase-change processes such as boiling, evaporation and condensation. To improve these technologies that convert thermal energy to electrical energy or provide clean water, phase-change phenomena must be both efficient and controllable. The goal of this CAREER project is to integrate research and education around the use of ultrafast (20-100 nanoseconds) and fast (0.1-10 microseconds) pulsed plasma discharges in liquids and vapors to probe, manipulate or tune and enhance heat and mass transfer processes during liquid-vapor phase change encountered in boiling and desalination processes. Plasma, one of the four fundamental states of matter, is an ionized and highly energetic state of matter with unique physical and optical properties (consider, for example, lightning). By controlling the duration of a plasma in a dense fluid, such as liquid water, losses via heat transfer and electrolysis may be minimized, and the impact of the plasma on the fluid may be controlled. In this project, the plasma will be tailored to the applications. Ultrafast or non-thermal pulsed plasmas will be sued to measure temperature and species or locally perturb a fluid during boiling, and fast or thermal pulsed plasmas will be used to locally alter the state of the fluid in desalination processes. The project will also leverage this cross-disciplinary approach to convey the importance of efficient energy conversion and water resource utilization to a diverse group of students, ranging from grades K-8 to the university level, in the Bryan-College Station area of Texas. The goals of these efforts are to engage, encourage, and support the pursuit of science-related higher education and to train informed, current/future consumers of our energy and water resources.<br/><br/>The intellectual focus of this project is the interaction between extremely short timescale pulsed non-thermal and thermal plasma discharges in dense fluids and the thermodynamic phase transitions that result from rapid energy deposition in the fluid. These plasma-fluid interactions will be experimentally characterized to fundamentally study highly transient liquid-vapor-solid phase-change and the physicochemical processes resulting from the controlled energy/timescale of pulsed plasma discharges in fluids. The fundamental studies will be leveraged to develop novel optical diagnostic techniques to measure species concentration and vapor phase temperature in situ during phase-change heat transfer using a non-thermal plasma as the probe. The findings will also be used to tune and enhance heat/mass transfer processes during boiling heat transfer and water purification through on-demand and localized bubble nucleation via a non-thermal plasma and salt-water separations through a thermal plasma. The plasma-fluid interaction framework will be leveraged as a novel vehicle to engage and introduce a diverse group of early-age students to energy conversion and clean water technologies and to spark their interest in science and engineering higher-education. The knowledge resulting from these research activities will also be actively integrated into thermal-fluid sciences curricula at the undergraduate and graduate levels to introduce and train students in state-of-the-art energy conversion and water purification technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Variations in the concentration of 13C atoms are represented relative to the concentration of 12C atoms and expressed as the 13C/12C ratio.  The utility of measuring spatial variations in the 13C/12C of CO2 in the ocean results from two observations.  First, during photosynthesis the 13C/12C of the plant (phytoplankton in the ocean) is distinctly different from the 13C/12C of CO2 consumed during photosynthesis.  Second, the 13C/12C of CO2 molecules produced during the combustion of fossil fuels (coal, oil, natural gas) is measurably different from the 13C/12C of CO2 in the atmosphere and ocean.  As a result, measuring the spatial variations of 13C/12C of CO2 in the ocean can be used to estimate variations in the rate of photosynthesis and the rate at which CO2 produced by fossil fuel combustion is being adsorbed by the ocean.  Estimating variations in these two rates are goals of this project. <br/><br/>The 13C/12C of CO2 in the ocean depends in large part on the rates of photosynthesis and respiration, which results in spatial covariations in the 13C/12C of CO2, concentrations of primary nutrients (nitrate and phosphate) and trace elements that are used by phytoplankton (e.g., Cadmium). In this project, the planned measurements of the 13C/12C of CO2, nutrients and trace elements during the GEOTRACES GP17 cruise will be used to determine how the north-south variations in biological productivity (photosynthesis and respiration), elemental composition of sinking particles and water mass mixing control the regional variations in the 13C/12C of CO2, nutrients and bioactive trace element distributions in the S. Pacific Ocean. An improved understanding of the biological, chemical and physical processes that control spatial variations of 13C/12C of CO2, bioactive trace elements and nutrient distributions in the modern ocean will improve our ability to use 13C/12C and trace elements measurements on CaCO3 preserved in the sedimentary record to reconstruct past changes in the ocean circulation and CO2 cycling in the paleo ocean.

This is especially true in multi-scale simulations when handling massive simulation data from different scales. The emerging big memory infrastructures have shown great potential to increase the simulation scale and solve larger numerical problems. However, using big memory architectures for the multi-scale simulation is challenging, because of limited computing capability in the big memory machines and memory heterogeneity introduced by big memory. There is a lack of a software infrastructure that can release the full power of big memory to accelerate multi-scale simulation. This project aims to create a capability and a software package (named SciMem) that enables high performance multi-scale simulation on big memory platforms. The techniques presented offer a path for general use of this structure for a wide variety of applications having a broad impact on science and engineering. There will be impact on the students through their direct involvement with the project and through the integration with the educational activities.<br/><br/>The project will enable high performance multi-scale simulations on big memory platforms through more efficient utilization of large and heterogeneous memory machines.

While the ultimate impact of the pandemic is still unknown, the U.S. academic sector continues to face hiring freezes, lost jobs, and general job market uncertainty. These negative consequences are disproportionately impacting women and other underrepresented groups as well as low-resourced institutions. This perfect storm occurs at a time when the primacy of U.S. innovation and research is facing unprecedented competitive pressure and providing pathways to retain highly talented researchers in their fields is crucial. As a country, we cannot afford to lose an entire cohort of highly educated research engineers, but we are in danger of doing just that as doctoral engineering students graduate into an extremely challenging job market that could force them to abandon their advanced research career ambitions. To address this need, the American Society for Engineering Education (ASEE) will launch the Engineering Fellows (E-Fellows) program, enabling recent engineering doctoral graduates to obtain two-year postdoctoral positions at U.S. academic institutions despite the current economic downturn caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. The E-Fellows program will provide rich postdoctoral experiences that will prepare participants for successful research careers in academia or industry while also serving as an employment bridge during a time of hiring freezes and job market uncertainty, helping to retain fellows who might otherwise leave the engineering research career pathway.

Based on the successful Computing Innovation Fellows (CIFellows) program, the E-Fellows program will bridge the gap to provide hands-on experience in academic research, attract and retain new doctoral students into academic pathways, boost connections to our nation's best scholars, prepare new doctoral students to navigate the challenging job market, and retain them in technical research fields. Application and selection to the E-Fellows program will follow a comprehensive evaluation of merit and diversity indicators (along individual and institutional dimensions), with emphasis on intellectual merit and broader impacts in applicant materials. This unique new fellowship program will be supported by research-based, high-impact educational methods such as the application of a cohort model, implementation of first-year and culminating experiences, enactment of networking and mentoring experiences, and fulfillment of andragogical just-in-time professional development, within an intentionally designed outcome-based experiential learning theoretical framework. A five-year longitudinal evaluation will be completed for each cohort to evaluate the effectiveness of the fellowship in (1) preparing E-Fellows to be job market savvy and (2) retaining E-Fellows as researchers in their fields. The outputs of the fellowship?s longitudinal evaluation will inform future engineering fellowship design necessary to maintain U.S. technological leadership.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The full realization of this potential requires atomic-level mastery over the synthesis of wafer-scale films and bulk crystals with high crystalline perfection and also the discovery of new material compositions and structures. The 2DCC focuses on advancing the synthesis science of 2D materials through the development of state-of-the-art experimental and computational tools and techniques for thin film deposition and bulk crystal growth supported by advanced characterization and processing. A facility-wide data management system captures and curates sample data with additional functionality to enable new modes of data-enabled research. An in-house team of researchers works collaboratively with external users to accelerate discovery of new materials, to develop processes for synthesis of large area 2D films to transition toward commercialization, and to disseminate knowledge, samples, data, and techniques within a national user facility that acts as a hub for scientific training and cross-fertilization. Outreach and training activities targeted at users and the broader 2D community include webinars, an annual workshop on 2D materials, on-line tutorials and a data science workshop. The 2DCC engages the materials research community across academia, industry and government laboratories across career stages, including students and faculty at minority serving or primarily undergraduate institutions. On-site training opportunities are targeted at developing the next generation of crystal growers and tool developers and broadening participation in synthesis and advanced characterization.<br/><br/>Technical Description: The development of quantum materials in recent decades has led to transformative discoveries of emergent phenomena resulting from the interplay of reduced dimensionality, confinement, topology, and interactions. Two-dimensional layered chalcogenides (2DLC) are a prime example of this class of materials, encompassing van der Waals heterojunctions, topological insulators, topological semimetals, and high-temperature Fe-chalcogenide superconductors. The 2D Crystal Consortium (2DCC), an NSF Materials Innovation Platform, is motivated by the potential of 2DLCs for new physics and high-impact technologies tempered by the significant challenges associated with their synthesis. The Platform exploits 2DCC in-house expertise in materials growth by molecular beam epitaxy, metalorganic chemical vapor deposition, confinement heteroepitaxy, modeling of materials growth kinetics and sample properties, and bulk crystal growth. New synthesis capabilities include double-crucible Bridgman methods that target extreme stoichiometric precision and an integrated plasma/evaporation tool for scalable synthesis of air-stable 2D polar metals. This synthesis web is interconnected with a comprehensive suite of advanced spectroscopy, scanning probe and processing tools allowing sample exchange while maintaining vacuum or inert-gas environments. Data generated throughout the facility feeds into a sample data tracking system that embeds knowledge graph functionality to enable new modes of data-enabled materials discovery. Theory and computational tools are deployed in a tightly integrated theory-computation-measurement-synthesis loop that targets the understanding of both key kinetic growth processes and the results of in situ and ex situ characterization, following the vision of the Materials Genome Initiative.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cornell University, in partnership with Johns Hopkins University, forms the Platform for the Accelerated Realization, Analysis, and Discovery of Interface Materials (PARADIM). PARADIM is a national user facility enabling a more effective way of doing materials research: one that accelerates materials discovery by establishing an ecosystem - a national community of practitioners - that is equipped with experimental and theoretical methods to enable users to realize inorganic materials with superior electronic characteristics. The scope of PARADIM is the realization of inorganic materials with superior electronic characteristics in the form of single crystals and epitaxial thin films with an emphasis on new interface quantum materials. The inorganic materials realized by PARADIM users have either never been made before or are to be made with a perfection, purity, or interfacing with other materials for which there are compelling reasons to believe that superior electronic characteristics will result. The open structure of the Platform democratizes materials discovery for all U.S. scientists and makes it possible for users to collectively apply the ""closed loop"" approach of the Materials Genome Initiative. PARADIM also provides numerous community-building and training components to prepare the future workforce including two annual week-long summer schools on materials-by-design approaches leveraging and informing users about PARADIM's facilities and capabilities.<br/><br/>Technical Description: PARADIM provides an advanced set of openly available equipment and expertise for the realization of inorganic materials with superior electronic characteristics. PARADIM's state-of-the-art facilities include (1) major crystal growth methods, especially optical floating-zone techniques; (2) a fully automated molecular-beam epitaxy system where users can select among 62 elements of the periodic table and see the electronic structure of the materials they produce by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy; (3) advanced electron microscopes for probing the structure, chemistry, and functional properties of materials down to the atomic scale; (4) artificial intelligence/machine learning approaches to leverage existing and new materials data to extract actionable information and aid users' materials realization in real-time; (5) theoretical capabilities to help design and understand materials as well as to analyze experimental data, and (6) a talented team who trains users how to make the most of these capabilities and improves these tools. The scope of the in-house research of PARADIM is to weave new ""quantum fabrics"" with tailored functionalities which arise by intertwining different quantum materials. Many new quantum technologies demand materials with properties that typically do not exist in bulk compounds, for instance, topological superconductors or quasiparticles with non-Abelian statistics. This is often because such properties may arise from multiple states that might normally be in competition with one another in a single compound. By weaving together ""threads"" with different properties, such as superconductivity or magnetism, PARADIM's in-house team aims to realize quantum fabrics with novel electronic, magnetic, topological, or a mixture of such textures and with functionalities that do not exist in bulk and could play an important role in future quantum technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These climatic archives provide an insightful picture of ice age cycles and of the related large global sea level fluctuations triggered by these significant climate rhythms. However, such records still provide limited insight as to how or which of Earth?s ice sheets contributed to higher sea levels during past warm climate periods. This is of particular importance for our modern world:  the Antarctic ice sheet is currently the world?s largest freshwater reservoir, which, if completely melted, would raise the global sea level by over 60 meters (200 feet). Yet, geologic records of Antarctic ice sheet sensitivity to warm climates are particularly limited and difficult to obtain, because the direct records of ice sheet geometry smaller than the modern one are still buried beneath the mile-thick ice covering the continent. Therefore, it remains unclear how much this ice sheet contributed to past sea level rise during warm climate periods or how it will respond to the anticipated near-future climate warming.  In the proposed research we seek to develop sub-ice chemical precipitates?minerals that form in lakes found beneath the ice sheet?as a climatic archive, one that records how the Antarctic ice sheet responded to past climatic change. These sub-ice mineral formations accumulated beneath the ice for over a hundred thousand years, recording the changes in chemical and isotopic subglacial properties that occur in response to climate change. Eventually these samples were eroded by the ice sheet and moved to the Antarctic ice margin where they were collected and made available to study. This research will utilize advanced geochemical, isotopic and geochronologic techniques to develop record of the Antarctica ice sheet?s past response to warm climate periods, directly informing efforts to understand how Antarctica will response to future warming.  <br/><br/>Efforts to improve sea level forecasting on a warming planet have focused on determining the temperature, sea level and extent of polar ice sheets during Earth?s past warm periods. Large uncertainties, however, in reconstructions of past and future sea levels, result from the poorly constrained climate sensitivity of the Antarctic Ice sheet (AIS). This research project aims to develop the use of subglacial precipitates as an archive the Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) past response to climate change. The subglacial precipitates from East Antarctica form in water bodies beneath Antarctic ice and in doing so provide an entirely new and unique measure of how the AIS responds to climate change. In preliminary examination of these precipitates, we identified multiple samples consisting of cyclic opal and calcite that spans hundreds of thousands of years in duration. Our preliminary geochemical characterization of these samples indicates that the observed mineralogic changes result from a cyclic change in subglacial water compositions between isotopically and chemically distinct waters. Opal-forming waters are reduced (Ce* <1 and high Fe/Mn) and exhibit elevated 234U/238U compositions similar to the saline groundwater brines found at the periphery of the AIS.  Calcite-forming waters, are rather, oxidized and exhibit ?18O compositions consistent with derivation from the depleted polar plateau (< -50 ?). 234U-230Th dates permit construction of a robust timeseries describing these mineralogic and compositional changes through time.  Comparisons of these time series with other Antarctic climate records (e.g., ice core records) reveal that calcite forming events align with millennial scale changes in local temperature or ?Antarctic isotopic maximums?, which represent Southern Hemisphere warm periods resulting in increased Atlantic Meridional overturing circulation. Ultimately, this project seeks to develop a comprehensive model as to how changes in the thermohaline cycle induce a glaciologic response which in turn induces a change in the composition of subglacial waters and the mineralogic phase recorded within the precipitate archive.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Transcription coupled repair (TCR) and global genomic repair (GGR) are two pathways that constitute NER. TCR is triggered by stalling of RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) at DNA damage sites and is dedicated to rapid removal of lesions in the transcribed strand of actively transcribed genes. TCR in eukaryotic cells is a complicated process and the underlying molecular mechanisms remain largely unresolved. In this project, a variety of approaches, including yeast genetics and proteomics, will be used to address long-standing questions about how TCR is regulated. This research on a fundamental DNA repair pathway will yield new insights into biological processes that maintain genome stability in the face of constant exposure to DNA damage. The project also includes substantive educational components, including training of graduate and undergraduate students as well as STEM outreach to local school students. <br/><br/>The project has three objectives. The first will address how the RNAPII stalk, consisting of Rpb4 and Rpb7 proteins, regulates TCR. Rpb4 and Rpb7 can either repress or facilitate TCR and directly interact with many as-yet-unidentified proteins. Rpb4 and Rpb7-interacting proteins will be identified and their functions in TCR will be analyzed. The second objective will examine how TCR facilitators, including Rad26, Rpb9, Sen1 and Elf1, interplay with each other, with the TCR repressors Spt4/Spt5, and with RNAPII to regulate transcriptional lesion bypass and TCR. Finally, the third objective will investigate the role of the Pleckstrin homology domain (PHD) of Tfb1, a TFIIH subunit, in TCR and GGR.

For instance, a news article online can be expressed by its textual content, the images it may contain, its author, its publication date, and the number of times it has been shared in social media.  Integration of those aspects has been shown to be beneficial in a number of data science tasks, such as extracting the topic of an article or ascertaining its trustworthiness. Tensor decomposition, a class of multi-aspect data analytic methods, has been empirically shown to be particularly effective in such integration in a number of diverse applications, including: chemometrics, signal processing, social network analysis, and brain data analysis. Despite their effectiveness, current tensor methods have a crucial limitation that hinders their broad applicability: conducting tensor analysis is largely a manual endeavor that entails laborious trial-and-error tuning and requires both high familiarity with tensor methods and domain expertise in the target application. As a result, the number of practitioners who can successfully apply tensor analysis is limited and, thus, tensor analysis has not enjoyed as broad an adoption despite being such a powerful tool. The goal of this project is to democratize the entire, currently laborious and highly inaccessible, process of unsupervised exploratory tensor analysis, towards producing actionable insights from raw multi-aspect data.  Towards broad convergence of research, practice, and education, the project will integrate the research outcomes to the investigator's educational and outreach activities. Those activities include the introduction of research outcomes to the development of undergraduate and graduate data science curricula, organization of workshops and tutorials at major research venues for disseminating the research outcomes to the scientific community, mentoring undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, and organizing summer workshops for teachers and capstone projects for students in collaboration with the local school district towards broadening the presence of data science in high school education.<br/><br/><br/>The research activities are organized in two major tasks: (i) Algorithms for unsupervised autonomous tensor analysis and (ii) Real-world applications, in collaboration with domain experts. Towards democratizing tensor decomposition, in the first task, the project will be the first to formulate in a principled manner a number of very challenging problems which have traditionally been tackled manually and which are essential in unsupervised tensor analysis. The project will develop methods of self-supervised learning in order to learn tensor datasets with exploitable and meaningful structure from raw data, solving a fundamental problem in data preparation for tensor analysis. The project has parallels with the emerging fields of meta-learning and auto-ML, which have recently gained traction in the data science and machine learning communities. However, the focus of those fields has overwhelmingly been to automate the fine-tuning of supervised models. The lack of supervision in this endeavor, however, poses major challenges and presents a huge opportunity: success of the project has the potential to create a new field of unsupervised exploratory meta-learning where the goal is to extract actionable and interpretable insights from raw data in an unsupervised manner. In order to maximize the potential benefit to the academic community, industry, and society at-large, and to stress-test the proposed methods on a wide array of diverse data (e.g., text, images, graphs, time-series, and scientific data), the second task of the project will focus on two major applications: (i) Misinformation detection on the Web: The project will provide the public with tools to better judge the trustworthiness of news online, towards more informed and active citizenry. (ii) Gravitational wave detection: the study of gravitational waves can help unravel current mysteries of the universe and analyze cosmic objects that do not emit light.

Information becomes progressively available over time via continuous stream of noisy data. For example, molecular biology databases are always updated with various new gene-protein relationships (e.g., gene regulations, genetic interactions) validated in wet lab experiments. High-energy experiments in astro-particle physics give rise to large amounts of data in the form of continuous high-volume streams. Interpersonal interaction behaviors (e.g., facial expressions, gestures) contain rhythms that are not only correlated in time but also exhibit phase synchronization in an ongoing flow of mutual influence. In order to fully exploit these non-stationary streams of data online and in real-time, this project aims to build machine intelligence capable of quantifying uncertainty, constantly accommodating new information, and consolidating previously acquired knowledge in the meantime. The project is specifically motivated by applications to computational biology, astro-physics, and human interaction behaviors, and will result in innovative online inference methods that are broadly applicable across data-intensive domains. Furthermore, this research will support the interdisciplinary development of a diverse student body of disability, women, and minorities, and the development of graduate-level machine learning courses. The outreach work will contribute to increasing partnerships between academia and industry, and increasing public scientific literacy.<br/><br/>The overarching research objective is to create a unified dynamic statistical inference framework based on Bayesian nonparametrics to jointly update deep neural network parameters, adapt neural architectures, and consolidate acquired knowledge. The investigator highlights three inter-related projects that significantly advance this research agenda: (1) neural parameter online inference: design and develop online inference algorithms to recursively update posterior distributions of neural network parameters with continuous data stream, (2) neural architecture online inference: create modeling and computational methods to enable deep neural architectures to automatically go through a qualitative growth to accommodate progressively available information from new data as they are streaming, and (3) dynamic knowledge distillation: design and develop modeling methods to merge old knowledge with new one while both neural parameters and architectures are evolving to extract statistical structures from heterogeneous data stream.

The microbes that live in and near plant roots (the plant microbiome) likely play key roles in affecting the rate of shrub encroachment but their influence on shrub establishment and migration success has not yet been examined. To predict how plant-microbe and plant-plant (in this case shrub/grass) interactions will drive or slow plant population expansion in future climates requires evaluating the spatial and temporal scales at which these interactions occur. Using both field and lab experiments and mathematical models, this project will enable forecasts of how plant-plant and plant-microbe interactions reshape the abundance and distributions of shrub and grass species at the limits of their geographic distributions. Shrubland-grassland dynamics affect the amount of carbon stored by an ecosystem, drive rangeland management decisions, influence strategies to conserve biodiversity, and extend over 330 million hectares of North America alone. This project trains students at many levels, and builds partnerships with stakeholders and managers to ensure knowledge transfer to the benefit of society. A science-art collaboration is also embedded in the research activities, including the design and creation of 3D-printed plant models and artistic interpretations of plant morphologies. A museum exhibit of these models and microbe plant interactions will be created to expand public outreach and create an aesthetic expression of the inter-relationships of microbes and plants.<br/><br/>The proposed research will elucidate how plant root and soil associated microbes influence plant species range movements under environmental change. Research activities include the acquisition of novel quantitative data on key parameters that determine range spread: the spatial extent and temporal speed at which plants influence their microbial environment and the relative strength of the microbe/plant feedbacks compared to plant/plant competitive interactions. Experiments on field observations will determine the underlying mechanisms of plant-microbe interactions by addressing the following questions: (1) What is the spatial extent of plant-soil feedback between foundation species at ecotones where range limits collide? This question will be addressed using spatially-explicit paired field and greenhouse experiments to quantify the spatial extent of plant/microbe feedbacks as they influence both grass and shrub performance. (2) How does elevated CO2 affect microbial feedbacks and coexistence between foundation species at these ecotones? This question will be addressed using a growth chamber experiment to contrast microbial feedbacks and competition between grass and shrubs under ambient versus elevated CO2. (3) By what mechanisms do plant species cultivate unique microbial communities through time? This will be addressed with a field experiment to evaluate mechanisms underlying soil and microbial modification by plants and the temporal scale of each mechanism.  Finally, quantitative models will be developed using the data from these experiments and observations to address the question, (4) How do soil microbes contribute to range expansion, contraction, or stabilization at species range limits, and how will elevated CO2 change range limit dynamics? The project breaks new ground ni evaluating plant/soil feedbacks in a spatial and temporal context using a well-documented, ecologically important, and experimentally tractable range shift: the encroachment of C3 woody shrubs into C4 grasslands in the American Southwest. Shrub encroachment can dramatically alter biodiversity and ecosystem processes, including carbon storage<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Beyond simply storing data, one increasingly common requirement is to store activity data, also known as log data, which describe things that happen rather than things that are. Activity data are generated by computing systems, scientific instruments, electrical devices, etc. as well as by humans. The fast growing of activity data stresses current data management systems beyond their capability and becomes a known killer performance bottleneck of high-performance computing systems. This project develops ChronoLog, a novel system for organizing and storing activity data effectively and efficiently. ChronoLog leverages modern storage hardware and provides user-focused plugins and easy-to-use interface for productivity. It will benefit a diverse range of communities in various ways, such as enabling better fraud detection in financial transactions, faster and more accurate weather predictions and simulations, reduced time-to-insight for medical and bioengineering data, autonomous computing (e.g., driving), and more secure web and mobile services. <br/><br/>ChronoLog uses physical time to provide a synchronization-free data distribution and the total ordering on a log. It first leverages multiple storage tiers, such as storage-class memories (e.g., 3D XPoint) and new flash storage (e.g., NVMe SSDs), to transparently scale the log via log auto-tiering. It then adopts a tunable parallel access model, which offers multiple-writers-multiple-readers (MWMR) semantics and highly concurrent I/O, to fully utilize the multi-tiered storage environment. ChronoLog's innovative design supports high-performance data access via I/O isolation between tails and historical operations, efficient resource utilization with newly developed elastic storage capabilities, and scalability using a novel 3D log distribution. It facilitates data processing pipelining by acting as an authoritative source of strong consistency and with the help of fast append and commit semantics. It can be used as an arbitrator offering a plethora of features such as transactional isolation and atomicity, a consensus engine for consistent replication and indexing services, and a scalable data integration and warehousing solution. ChronoLog and its plugins establish a robust, flexible, and high-performance storage ecosystem that promotes the development of scalable applications and services for high performance computing systems. The project includes a diverse group of collaborators who share a common need for a fundamentally new approach to distributed logging to address their use cases. These close partnerships will strengthen the bonds between academic and applied science, ultimately leading to new applications and driving discovery in domains as diverse as geoscience, cosmology, and astrophysics.

The processes that control the efficiency of these modern-day devices depend on many variables. Some of these variables, such as the structure of the molecules that make up the devices, we can control by molecular design. However, some variables are still difficult to control because they depend on how molecules are arranged spatially with respect to each other, rather than the individual structure of each molecule. This supra-molecular arrangement cannot typically be dictated by traditional chemical synthesis. With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program and the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program in the Division of Materials Research, Prof. Dinca and his research group tackle this challenge: to ultimately control how molecules are arranged with respect to each other such that when light interacts with the solids made by these molecules, the energy formed, called an exciton, can be quantified and directed. This provides a deeper understanding of how energy is transported within solids, to ultimately provide a blueprint to increase the efficiency of modern devices such as organic photovoltaics, light-emitting diodes, and other optical devices. As part of this award the principal investigator also provides training for graduate and undergraduate students in issues related broadly to synthesis of materials, as well as photophysical investigations and related analytical techniques, and engages in outreach activities in the Boston area.<br/><br/>Technical summary<br/>Excitons are bound electron-hole pairs that form when light interacts with matter. Although much is understood about how excitons form and how they travel within solids, little is known about how to control them. As such, despite the importance of exciton dynamics for determining efficiencies in a range of technologies from solar cells to light-emitting diodes and organic lasers, there are no clear synthetic handles on controlling the relative orientation of the organic components that give rise to excitons. Indeed, the distance and angles between chromophore molecules in the solid state, is intimately involved in determining exciton diffusion and lifetimes, but current techniques and materials do not allow systematic control of these metrics. This project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry Program and the Electronic and Photonic Materials Program in the Division of Materials Research investigates a class of solids where the distance and the angles between organic molecules can be systematically tuned even in the sub-angstrom regime called metal-organic frameworks. Prof. Dinca and his research group use metal-organic frameworks to demonstrate the ability to control exciton formation and dynamics. In particular, this project focuses on three important processes involving excitons: singlet fission, triplet upconversion, and thermally-activated delayed fluorescence. All three processes depend critically on the relative orientation of neighboring organic molecules, as well as on the molecular conformation or shape of the particular chromophore involved in light absorption.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project develops flexible, interpretable, and scalable Bayesian embeddings for massive high-order interaction events, in order to understand a variety of complex relationships between the events and discover the underlying rich patterns. The developed tools can fundamentally promote many important knowledge mining and prediction tasks. Examples include predicting the occurrence of hazardous online transactions to enhance financial security, predicting the outbreak and spreading of pandemic diseases to take effective preventive actions, early warnings of catastrophes, studying when and how rumors propagate through online social media, etc. <br/><br/><br/>Current approaches for event data analysis are mostly restricted to binary interactions, and suffer from rough, over-simplified or opaque, uninterpretable modeling with limited computational efficiency.

The research will be accomplished through four primary tasks: (1) using marked point processes to design highly expressive yet transparent Bayesian embedding models, (2) using variational transforms and composite Monte-Carlo approximations to fulfill stochastic mini-batch gradient and asynchronous stochastic learning on extremely large-scale batch data, (3) efficient posterior incremental learning for rapid event streams, and (4) comprehensive evaluations on synthetic and real-world applications.

There is a fundamental mismatch between the capabilities of traditionally designed servers and the dynamic requirements of modern applications. This mismatch leads to poor utilization and significant waste of resources. A new way to design datacenters, called the disaggregated approach, can address this problem by creating a need-based on-demand model for computing. Here, servers are specialized to perform specific functions, and applications use only those specialized servers that best perform the functions needed by each application. While the disaggregated approach improves utilization and makes datacenters easier to manage, it comes at a performance cost: disaggregation requires applications to access critical resources spread across a set of specialized servers over the datacenter network. To mitigate such challenges of resource disaggregation, this project designs HardLambda, a new Function-as-a-Service (FaaS) abstraction that brings the functional and hardware requirements of an application together in a unified fashion. HardLambda enables datacenters to allocate resources in ways that best meet application needs while retaining the resource utilization and management flexibility of disaggregated hardware. The designed algorithms and system software will enable scalable control and sharing of disaggregated resources, and create new approaches to adaptive resource allocation. <br/><br/>HardLambda will make disaggregated datacenters a viable and sustainable option for numerous applications in science and industry. The project especially targets machine and deep learning (ML/DL) applications due to their increasingly crucial role in many aspects of modern computing-powered life. At the same time, HardLambda will improve the sustainability of large-scale datacenters, where high utilization, efficiency, and continuous adaptation to application requirements are all essential factors. The research will create new knowledge on hardware and software co-designed FaaS systems and services, and yield insights for efficiently supporting ML/DL applications at extremely large scales. The project will engage with partners in industry and national research laboratories to deploy HardLambda in real systems and will undertake educational and broadening participation activities to improve community awareness and understanding of the scaling and sustainability challenges of large-scale computing infrastructure. Special emphasis will be given to engaging students from underrepresented groups in the research and educational activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These user-facing, interactive apps must achieve low latency responses in order to satisfy users, which cannot always be met by waiting for a user's decision before reacting.  An alternative is to pre-fetch data in anticipation of users' choices.  There are several limitations to existing uses of prefetching: (1) it is often developed in an adhoc way for each application, and does not consider all optimization aspects, and (2) they do not explicitly take advantage of the  approximation tolerant nature of many interactive applications.   Approximation tolerance means that users prefer fast but approximated,  over fully correct but slow, results.<br/><br/>This project designs a General Prefetching Framework called GPF that explicitly decouples prediction and scheduling from the client application.  A configurable prediction model estimates the likelihood of requests at different future time intervals, and a general scheduler uses these predictions to decide which requests to send to the client.  This framework is novel in several ways: (1) rather than explicit requests, the client occasionally offers predictions to the scheduler, which considers network and resource conditions when pushing results to the client, (2) GPF exploits application tolerance to send  partial results for a massive number of candidate requests, rather than full results for a few requests, and (3) GPF dynamically shifts placement of  the predictor and scheduler computation on the client or server based on latency, network, and resource conditions.<br/><br/>The supporting research brings together performance and scheduling ideas from the networking community with optimization, storage, and interaction ideas from the database and visualization communities.

The interaction stems from the repulsion between electrons because of their electric charge, as well as their spin and other degrees of freedom. It leads to exotic, often unexpected, phases of matter. To study these phases and phenomena, it is important to minimize the imperfections, such as impurities and defects, so that electron-electron interaction is the dominating factor. The goal of this project is to experimentally explore and understand the new phases that arise in electron systems with the least amount of imperfections. Results of the research are communicated through publications and conference presentations to the specialized as well as general science and engineering communities. While the subject of this project is fundamental, progress in this area benefits society in the long term as it may lead to novel, transformative concepts for electronic devices and information processing systems, such as a quantum computer, whose operation relies on quantum and/or interaction phenomena. The project also incorporates a high quality and comprehensive educational component as it includes the education of students in critical, state-of-the art areas of science and technology, including the fabrication, characterization, and physics of very high-quality, thin-film semiconductor structures. Well-trained students in these fields are invaluable resources for the US as well as for the rest of the world. <br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>This project encompasses experimental investigations of electron interaction physics in quantum-confined GaAs/AlGaAs semiconductor structures with ultra-high-quality, as quantified by their record-high mobilities and new many-body states. The program includes studies of both fabrication via the molecular beam epitaxy technique, and of the electronic transport properties at low temperatures and high magnetic fields where electron correlation phenomena dominate. The emphasis of the work is on two-dimensional electron and hole systems confined to selectively doped GaAs quantum wells. The two-dimensional electron systems have the highest mobility among all solid-state materials, while the larger effective mass and the strong spin-orbit interaction in two-dimensional hole systems add additional, novel twists to their electronic properties. Several exotic phases of these interacting two-dimensional carrier systems are studied during the course of this project; these include the fractional quantum Hall effect, composite fermions, Wigner crystal, and stripe and bubble phases. Competition between the fractional quantum liquid and the Wigner crystal at large perpendicular magnetic fields (small Landau level filling factors), as well as many-body states in excited Landau levels are being investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Aerosol particles act as cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and therefore changes in aerosol particle abundance can alter the cloud drop concentrations and subsequently cloud reflectivity and lifetime as well as associated precipitation. Tropical deep convective clouds (DCC) are important to Earth?s global energy balance and hydrologic cycle and can induce high impact weather with significant precipitation and lightning. However, the effects of aerosol particles on DCC properties, including the onset and amount of precipitation, vertical development, electrification and associated lightning, and the extent and lifetime of associated high altitude ice clouds, remain poorly quantified. In this project, the effect of aerosol particles on such weather and climate related phenomena is studied, addressing a major open question of whether and how human-induced aerosol particle pollution has altered weather phenomena (e.g., potentially moving tropical showers to thunderstorms), and climate. Global climate models are being used to inform socioeconomic policy decisions around the world, but the processes investigated in this project are practically absent from these models. Therefore, the outcome of this study could have broad impacts on our understanding of the anthropogenic aerosol impacts on climate predictions and in turn upon policies being developed for mitigation and adaptation. The project will train graduate and undergraduate students through international collaboration in the fundamental physics and chemistry of the atmosphere and developing their technical skills in the analysis of large multivariable datasets, 3-dimensional computer models of the atmosphere, and satellite remote sensing technology. <br/><br/>Tropical marine regions are likely most sensitive to the additional input of aerosol particles which act CCN. Ultrafine aerosol particles (UAP) < 40 nm in size are not typically considered CCN, but they may in fact nucleate cloud droplets in DCC. Observations of UAP, specifically, and CCN, are lacking in such clean regions needed to test hypotheses about the aerosol impacts on deep convective clouds and associated effects on climate. To address these limitations, this joint NSF-BSF project between University of Washington (UW), The Hebrew University Jerusalem Israel (HUJI), and collaborators, leverages i) remote sensing of DCC microphysics to constrain CCN and UAP impacting individual convective events, ii) analysis of 15 years of global tropical lightning stroke fields guided by chemical transport model predictions of UAP and CCN, and iii) cloud resolving modelling of key domains constrained by the satellite remote sensing insights, lightning observations, and chemical transport model predictions of UAP and CCN. The project will evaluate how CCN, including UAP, perturb the microphysics of tropical deep convective clouds and to what extent such perturbations affect lightning and cloud radiative effects, and provide a test of the hypothesis that increases in CCN and UAP since preindustrial time, due to human activities associated with fuel combustion, have induced a positive radiative forcing (warming) on climate through deep convective clouds. Such a climate forcing would be in opposition to the negative radiative forcing in which CCN increases affects low cloud albedo and lifetime and would alter our understanding of climate sensitivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As large-scale data collection increases, the design of methods to infer causality between treatment and outcome by partitioning observations into appropriate sets has become an attractive alternative.  Current methods underlying causal inference suffer from several fundamental challenges that may lead to sub-optimal policy selection. This project will develop tractable computational approaches to facilitate better policy decision making. As an important use case, the project will evaluate policies for improving treatment quality of Opioid Use Disorder (OUD) using large-scale U.S. healthcare data.  The integrated education and research plan will attract and involve a diverse student body, from high school through graduate school, in research and practice.  Through active engagement with partnering organizations, including community colleges and an HBCU, the project will provide opportunities for members of underrepresented groups in engineering to address pressing societal needs. <br/><br/>Using a modern optimization perspective, this project will advance existing methods for causal inference by developing a theoretical and computational framework that encompasses both inference and matching to identify causality from an observational study.  The research objectives are to (1) establish a robust causal inference framework with matching methods to reduce uncertainty, (2) ensure covariate balance in high dimensional space, (3) develop optimal covariate balance techniques to reduce bias and model dependency by ensuring desired distributional properties, and (4) evaluate and advance U.S. healthcare policies based on this framework. To this end, a rigorous optimization framework will be employed to explicitly account for uncertainties in causal inference, maintain neighborhood structures of high dimensional data in low dimensions with matching requirements, and ensure optimal distributional properties of observational data. Efficient exact solution algorithms will be developed exploiting problem structure.

A task that is fundamental to the operation of these systems is decentralized optimization, where participating nodes cooperate to minimize an overall objective function that is the sum (or average) of individual nodes? local objective functions. Moreover, since individual nodes? local objective functions may bear sensitive information of local nodes such as medical records in collaborative learning and user energy-consumption profiles in a smart grid, in many cases, the decentralized optimization algorithm has to make sure that a participant?s sensitive information is protected from being inferable by other participating nodes or external eavesdroppers. Although plenty of results have been proposed for decentralized optimization, most of these results do not consider the problem of privacy protection. Conventional information-technology privacy mechanisms are inappropriate for decentralized optimization because they either have to compromise the accuracy of optimization (in, e.g., differential-privacy-based approaches) or incur heavy extra computation/communication overhead (in, e.g., cryptography-based privacy approaches). The lack of effective privacy solutions for decentralized optimization not only severely hinders the social adoption of new technologies, but also leads to potential vulnerabilities since stealing private information is usually the basis for sophisticated cybersecurity attacks.  Leveraging the iterative properties of decentralized optimization algorithms, the project aims to establish a new privacy-preserving approach for decentralized optimization that neither compromises optimization accuracy nor incurs large computation/communication overhead. Combined with the additional merit of needing no assistance of a trusted central coordinator, the proposed approach is expected to transformatively advance privacy-preservation in networked systems and make impacts in many applications ranging from connected vehicles, swarm robotics, smart grid, sensor networks, to collaborative machine learning. <br/><br/>Leveraging control theory, this project seeks to establish methodologies and associated theories for inherently privacy-preserving decentralized optimization by exploiting the intrinsic dynamical properties of decentralized optimization. Besides maintaining optimization accuracy, the dynamics-based privacy approach is also free of encryption, which not only guarantees limited extra computation/communication overhead, but also promises a decentralized implementation without the assistance of any trusted third party or data aggregator. The main research thrusts are to: 1) Develop a privacy framework for dynamical systems that explicitly considers the iterative evolution of information in decentralized optimization; 2) Design perturbations to dynamics that enable privacy without affecting the accuracy of decentralized optimization methods for convex problems, and quantify the effects of the perturbations on convergence speed; 3) Investigate the influence of privacy design on decentralized non-convex optimization and exploit freedom in privacy design to facilitate decentralized non-convex problems; and 4) Evaluate the results using experiments on a multi-robot platform and connected vehicles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Long-distance radio communications on Earth rely on reflection of radio waves by this layer; communications between satellites and ground stations rely on radio waves passing through this layer.  The quality of such radio communications highly depends on density of charged particles in the ionosphere.  When there is large variation of the density, radio wave propagation could be disrupted.  One such large density variation at low latitudes is known as equatorial plasma bubbles (EPBs), which are often created under the combined influence of diurnal change of solar radiation and the atmosphere wind.  How these bubbles are related to the change of atmospheric wind is a fundamental science question and its understanding could lead to better prediction of when and where these bubbles may form and help to mitigate the interruptions they create.<br/><br/>The purpose of this project is to employ observations and modeling to investigate the relationship between thermospheric neutral winds and equatorial spread F (ESF), which is a manifestation of bubbles when detected by radars.  The fundamental science question to be addressed is:  How does the day-to-day variability of neutral winds contribute to the onset and evolution of EPBs?  A multi-year observational data of concurrent thermospheric neutral winds and EPBs in the low latitudes will be developed and used to determine the relationships between winds and ESF/scintillation.  The data will enable monitoring of the development and evolution of ESF and provide a deep insight into both the short-term (hourly, diurnal) and long-term (seasonal) processes and the underlying physics.  Additionally, the SAMI3 (Sami3 is Also a Model of the Ionosphere) ionosphere model will be used to capture the ionospheric dynamics associated with different thermospheric conditions, to allow determination of how various scenarios give rise to EPBs/ESF and how they evolve over short (diurnal) and long (seasonal) time periods.  The SAMI3 model is comprehensive and capable of addressing important problems in aeronomy that are not accessible with other models. The combination of the data and modeling will lead to a fundamentally deeper understanding of the dynamical processes underlying EPBs and ESF. <br/><br/>Over the long term, the ground-based neutral wind observations could be used to forecast the likelihood of ESF and predict the onset of scintillation and characterize its evolution with time. Being able to predict and characterize ESF/scintillation from ground-based sensors is critical for operational civilian and national security purposes. Scintillation affects trans-ionospheric radio signals up to a few GHz in frequency and as such can have detrimental impacts on systems such as: <br/>a) Satellite-based systems that are used for communications, positioning, navigation and timing. <br/>b) Both civil and national security vertical and oblique (over the horizon) radar systems. <br/>c) Scientific instruments requiring observations of trans-ionospheric radio signals (e.g., radio <br/>astronomy). <br/><br/>All the software and data from this research will be made publicly available.

NNA projects address convergence scientific challenges in the rapidly changing Arctic. The Arctic research is needed to inform the economy, security and resilience of the Nation, the larger region and the globe. NNA empowers new research partnerships from local to international scales, diversifies the next generation of Arctic researchers, and integrates the co-production of knowledge. This award fulfills part of that aim. <br/><br/>In the Arctic where, environmental conditions are rapidly changing, the need to monitor these changes is critical to inform natural resource management and land management, protect built infrastructure, reduce risk to human lives, and enhance community resilience for Arctic communities. Currently in Alaska and northern Canada there exist numerous environmental monitoring programs that are led and implemented by a diverse array of indigenous communities, government agencies, and research institutions, often with little coordination or connection to one another. Led by a diverse team representing dozens of entities, this project fosters the development of coordinated monitoring networks by linking existing programs across Alaska and northern Canada. This project aims to achieve the following objectives: 1) to better understand important phenomena and dynamics (e.g. long-distance wildlife migration patterns, shifting climate patterns, species and habitat shifts) that can only be observed by collecting information across large landscapes; 2) to provide individual programs with the opportunity to address shared needs, while reducing duplication of effort and leveraging limited capacity and resources; and 3) to support and strengthen community-based monitoring programs, which are led and/or implemented by indigenous communities. Over a period of 2 years, the team regularly engages participants from multiple stakeholder groups involved in environmental monitoring, including indigenous peoples, scientists, engineers, and resource managers. Together the group co-develops coordinated monitoring networks that will bring together data collected across Alaska and northern Canada and apply this information toward tacking critical challenges linked to food security, infrastructure vulnerability, human safety, land and resource management, and indigenous cultural practices sustained by the land and resources. Working groups co-create and implement strategies to tackle commonly-shared challenges to leverage resources, build capacity and expertise, reduce duplication, and facilitate synergy among programs. Drawing from best practices and strategies developed through this project, an education curriculum containing tools, resources, and training also is developed to strengthen community-based monitoring programs, including the ability for indigenous communities and scientific researchers to successfully collaborate. <br/><br/>Building off previous workshops, this diverse group of stakeholders collaborates during two face-to-face work sessions and forms long-term working groups to tackle specific topics remotely. The project is executed through an iterative process by which participating stakeholders guide the desired outcomes, priorities and topics to address, as well as the focus, design, and guidelines for establishing coordinated monitoring networks. The initial scope for monitoring networks includes themes of socioeconomics (hunting and fishing access, competition, technology), environmental hazards (erosion, flooding, ice conditions, wildland fire), and biological factors about dramatic changes affecting important subsistence resources (species abundance, disease, contaminants). These topics are expanding and will be finalized by participating stakeholders. The overall structure over a 2-year period centers around two in-person convenings (staged one year apart), two trainings, the formation of long-term working groups, and the development of a curriculum and written products. Project leaders and participants also co-organize sessions at major environmental conferences in the region - Alaska Tribal Conference on Environmental Management and the Alaska Forum on the Environment - to reach out to a broader audience regarding project activities and to receive feedback and engage in dialogue with community leaders, scientists, and managers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While prior studies have focused on investigating the experience of engineering students from underrepresented populations, they largely ignore students at the intersection of multiple marginalized identities and they often lack significant action to help create more inclusive environments. This project will take the next step to move beyond merely describing the experiences of marginalized engineering students. The ultimate goal of this work will be to change engineering culture by growing a collaborative, student-driven research community of underrepresented engineering students and allies. This community of scholar-activists will employ their scholarship on marginalized engineering student populations to advocate for personal and institutional change. Students will read and discuss relevant engineering education and sociology literature, reflect on their own experiences and actions, engage with activists across campus, conduct their own research on engineers from marginalized groups, and lead future community outreach and organization efforts. This project aligns with the Broadening Participation in Engineering (BPE) program to enhance the diversity and inclusion of underrepresented groups in engineering, particularly in its innovative approach to creating inclusive research communities that will improve retention of students from underrepresented groups and that can be replicated in other contexts.<br/><br/>In the pursuit to develop scholar-activists among students historically marginalized in engineering, this project will engage students in a vibrant research community where they are supported in pursuing their own undergraduate and graduate research projects for and about broadening participation in engineering. Key components of the project will include a research group that provides constructive feedback and support of student-initiated qualitative research, a network of faculty and graduate researcher mentors, journal clubs with an open invitation for marginalized students and allies to read and discuss the literature on BPE, and opportunities for all engineering faculty to learn inclusive practices. Our theoretical stance will follow the tenets of critical theory: (1) We will center the voices of the students in the research by engaging them as researchers. (2) We will value lived experience as an important qualification for doing this research. (3) We will empower the students leading the research, which will strengthen their social identities and potentially their activist identities. (4) We will integrate research and action and are prepared to deal with the inherent contradictions. To enact this critical approach and develop scholar-activists, we will use resistance and social justice literature from within and beyond engineering education. The overall model of creating a student-centered research community around marginalized engineers is potentially transformative and has potential for adoption at other institutions and for other engineering student populations. This project will train marginalized engineering students to build community wherever they go next. Additionally, this project is likely to improve climate and retention by creating additional (and increasing visibility of) safe spaces for marginalized engineering students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, recent evidence indicates a more dynamic replisome, where individual protein components exchange during replication, creating stochastic processes of DNA unwinding, priming, and synthesis. A more dynamic replisome would be useful in responding to various roadblocks or challenges to DNA replication progression. Still, enzymatic coordination at the replication fork must be maintained, otherwise one activity may dominate, creating excess and dangerous replication intermediates. This project will determine the molecular contacts between replisome proteins that act to coordinate and control DNA unwinding with synthesis. Undergraduate and graduate students will be trained in techniques of advanced enzyme kinetics, precise genetic manipulations, and novel biochemical and cellular assays. Scientific outreach programs will encourage local elementary school students to explore the wonders of their own genome through ""DNA Days"". <br/><br/>By definition, the advancement of the replisome is dependent on the DNA duplex unwinding activity of the hexameric helicase to create single-strand templates. Once it is unwound, the polymerase holoenzyme rapidly resynthesizes duplex DNA.

This research will also determine and differentiate coupled kinetic enzymatic processes from those that are linked directly through multisubunit replisome contacts.

Microscopic blood vessels in the body regulate blood flow to tissues via smooth muscle cells.  These smooth muscle cells automatically adjust vessel diameter in response to changing conditions.  When this process does not work correctly, it can cause a wide range of serious medical problems such as hypertension or brain dysfunction.  Current engineered organs and tissues are unable to mimic this ability to regulate blood flow and, if implanted in patients, are likely to cause the same serious medical problems.  To address this challenge, this work will develop a technique for putting smooth muscle cells inside microscopic blood vessels in engineered tissue and coaxing these cells to organize and behave in a way that is similar to their behavior in natural tissue.  We will then test to see whether the cells can adjust the diameter of the engineered microscopic blood vessels in a similar fashion.

Vascular resistance is locally modulated by adjustments in vessel lumen diameter in response to various internal and external changes (changes in temperature, body position, metabolic needs of various tissues, etc.), and is accomplished by the action of smooth muscle cells in the medial layer of the microvessel wall.  The objective of this research is to establish the knowledge needed to form a functional medial layer of contractile, circumferentially-oriented smooth muscle cells in an arteriole-sized microchannel, thereby enabling vasoconstriction or vasodilation in response to appropriate stimuli.  In particular, this work will investigate the ability of pulsatile flow to maintain contractile SMC phenotype and induce circumferential architecture on the microvessel wall, expose the cells to relevant vasoactive agents, and then characterize their ability to appropriately modulate the lumen diameter.

Familiar examples include the water-droplets forming clouds, the dust and combustion particles forming haze, and pollen particles emitted by plants. When in the atmosphere, aerosols affect the Earth?s energy budget by absorbing and scattering sunlight, which can lead to cooling or heating effects on the climate. The amount of light absorbed or scattered is determined by the shape, size, and composition of a particle. Consequently, it is of interest to develop methods to determine these properties of aerosol particles, whether that be to better understand their impact on the climate or as a way to study what types of particles are present in a given environment. This project develops a new way to characterize aerosols where images of free-flowing particles are obtained without the need to collect or immobilize the particles. The core of the approach involves digital holography (DH), which is functionally analogous to microscopy, except no lenses are needed and particle images are focused post-measurement in computational manner. The images obtained thus reveal the shape and size of the particles under investigation. In the conventional approach, however, the images are gray-scale in nature, and so, there is little sensitivity to the particle?s material. By extending DH to operate at three wavelengths (colors) simultaneously, this project brings color to the particle images. This presents the possibility of gaining particle-material information in a non-contact manner. Systematic studies of particles of different shapes and materials will be conducted to determine the quality of the color images. By applying a color analysis to such images, the project will test the ability to merge shape, size, and color information to differentiate between particle types. The outcome of this work could significantly advance the ability to characterize aerosols across multiple domains of scientific and applied interests.<br/><br/><br/>With conventional DH, gray-scale images of individual aerosol particles can be obtained in a contact-free manner. This capability has been adopted by numerous scientists and has advanced our understanding for the size and shape of particles in the atmosphere. What is missing in DH, however, is information about the particle material. By extending the principles of DH across the spectral domain, this project will bring color to images of free-flowing aerosol particles. The project applies chromaticity analysis to the images as a quantitative way to describe the colors exhibited. Because particles of different material absorb and reflect colors differently, this analysis has the potential to distinguish between categories of material. For example, mineral dust (MD) particles with radiatively absorbing components like iron oxides could be distinguished from particles with strongly scattering components like silicates. Biological particles could be distinguished from MD. The work will focus on the coarse mode aerosol (CMA), i.e., particles larger than one micrometer. Such particles are ubiquitous and include, e.g., wind-blown MD and biological particles. Not only is a particle?s size and shape revealed with DH, but the interference nature of the method allows the particle?s extinction cross section to be measured as well. The project will assemble a collection of CMA particles, characterize their material composition with X-ray diffraction and other analytical techniques, and perform chromaticity analysis on stationary particles from the collection. By aerosolizing these samples and capturing color DH images of the free-flowing particles, the study can test the ability of the analysis to associate observed particles with categories of known materials. The outcomes of the work will establish the feasibility and utility of color DH for aerosol characterization, from which future efforts could develop instruments for field studies of the atmospheric CMA at an unprecedented level of detail.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research demonstrates that traditional teacher preparation programs continue to fall short in recruitment, preparation, and retention of secondary mathematics teacher candidates from communities that have not historically been well represented in the teaching profession. The project seeks to prepare graduates to enact culturally responsive teaching practices and to showcase mathematics as a human activity that can be applied to address issues of equity and social justice, such as income inequality, climate change, and racism. The project seeks to increase the diversity and number of secondary mathematics teachers who adopt human perspectives and practices to meet the needs of learners in high-need schools.<br/><br/>This project at Washington State University includes partnerships between the Colleges of Arts & Sciences and Education, two campuses (Pullman and Vancouver), two regional Educational Service Districts (ESDs), Washington State Mathematics Fellows as virtual mentors, and mentor teachers from nine high-need local school districts. Project goals include: (1) recruiting 24 undergraduate mathematics majors over three years to pursue teacher certification; and (2) preparing mathematics teachers who will persist in teaching and can effectively meet the needs of students in high-need school districts. The project features both an undergraduate (Pullman campus) and a graduate (Vancouver campus) pathway. Grounded in theoretical perspectives of mathematics and mathematics teaching as humanizing activities, project activities will promote asset-based perspectives of students, mathematics learning environments that intellectually challenge all students and foster positive mathematical identities, and the use of mathematics to connect to the community and to promote social justice. Institutional data, edTPA scores, surveys regarding critical thinking and diversity preparedness, course artifacts, and focus group interviews will to be used to generate understanding of how programs can inspire prospective mathematics teachers to embody core humanizing principles. Broadly, the project hopes to serve as a model for humanizing mathematics teacher preparation as it promotes policies and narratives in mathematics and mathematics teaching that serve the needs of individuals from backgrounds underrepresented in STEM fields. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

HIFU procedure is not routinely conducted because its targeting effectiveness remained uncertain when compared to standard treatments for localized cancers. HIFU ablation in presence of direct injection of gold nanoparticles into subcutaneous tumors have shown enhanced ablation due to unique acoustic-thermal phenomenon, while thermal damage in adjacent normal tissues was reduced. However, HIFU ablation with direct gold-nanoparticles injection has yet to achieve its full potential because it primarily treats superficial tumors and that the heterogeneous gold-nanoparticles concentration at the injection site leads to uneven heating profiles. The objective is to achieve the goal of focused ablation at reduced HIFU power levels using functionalized-gold-nanoparticles enhanced energy deposition. The use of HIFU heating of systemically injected gold-nanoparticles for ablating deep-seated cancer could guide future larger-scale animal studies and treatment planning in humans. This unique interdisciplinary study links fields of cancer therapy, nanomaterials, bio-heat transfer, wave propagation, image analysis, and non-invasive surgical method, augmenting ongoing collaborations with US FDA and, in turn, benefiting medical and industry community. Undergraduate/minority students will be actively recruited as in the past.<br/><br/>The long-term goal is to develop HIFU-gold-nanoparticles ablation methods that selectively target and ablate deep-seated tumors. It is hypothesized that systemically injected functionalized-gold-nanoparticles exposed to reduced HIFU power will lead to improved targeting of tumors and enable uniform heat deposition, while minimizing collateral damage to surrounding tissues. To test the hypothesis, animal models with will be used to assess the efficacy by which functionalized gold-nanoparticles injected into the circulation combined with reduced HIFU power will achieve precise targeting and uniform ablation of prostate cancer. Nanotechnology will be used to develop functional gold-nanoparticles that can recognize specific cell-surface markers overexpressed on prostate cancer cells. It is expected that systemically injected functionalized-gold-nanoparticles will selectively target deep-seated cancer; and that they can be used to both image and ablate prostate cancer tissues with minimal collateral damage to adjacent tissues. This pilot research is expected to provide proof-of-principle that cancer tissues can take up multifunctional gold-nanoparticles and can be selectively ablated, thus developing a novel ablation approaches to treat cancer tissues. Such protocol would improve cancer patient care and management of disease.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This often means we have complete uncertainty about an instance before it is handed to an algorithm, which is too pessimistic. In practice, however, often this assumption is not quite right and instances of optimization problems arising from different application domains often have significant structure. In this project we exploit statistical data and distribution information on inputs of online decision-making algorithms to relax the pessimistic view. Such online decision-making algorithms had considerable momentum lately due to profound applications in the electricity market, advertisement auctions, dynamic mechanism designs, (reinforcement) learning, investment procedures, stock market, and even federal agency inspection programs. Our algorithms will build on and develop new general frameworks for solving algorithmic problems in the above real-life scenarios. The project will involve Ph.D. students and postdocs, undergraduate students, and even high-school students (especially students among minorities, women, LGBT, and persons with disabilities), many of whom will continue their research at other academic institutions and research centers, further broadening the impact of this project.<br/><br/>The classic online setting requires us to make decisions over time as the input is slowly revealed, without (complete) knowledge of the future. In this project we study stochastic uncertainty about input demands which are considered very realistic and has been widely studied in the past. Online settings of interest in this project are the ``prophet'' setting, the ``secretary'' setting, the ``prophet secretary'' setting, as well as the ``i.i.d.'' setting that for each of them, the investigator has already had pioneering work and deep contributions. In the prophet setting, demands are coming from possibly different distributions known in advance while in the secretary setting, demands are coming in a random order. In the prophet secretary setting, demands are coming from different distributions (at different times) which are randomly permuted but known in advance. Finally, in the i.i.d. setting, a special case of all previous settings, demands are coming from the same distribution all the time.  In these settings, we consider fundamental problems as well as applications in mechanism design, network design, and motion planning. The goal of this project is to combine tools, from areas such as stopping theory, online algorithms, machine learning, mechanism design, and operations research to resolve important research challenges in the field via novel techniques and to forge deeper connections among these areas. We will have special considerations for practical applications and simplicity of our algorithms and underlying principles to real-world settings. We will also incorporate our discoveries into existing and new courses about approximation algorithms, foundations of machine learning, and algorithmic game theory, and discuss further incorporation with statisticians and economists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Islands provide an excellent setting in which to study speciation in wild populations due to their discrete geography and well-characterized geologic record. The Indo-Pacific, from Southeast Asia to Polynesia, is the cradle of speciation theory and home to numerous geographic radiations of widespread, rapidly evolving species complexes. This project will synthesize genomics and state-of-the-art trait datasets to reveal processes that promote rapid radiations in nature. Specifically, it will use a widespread, species-rich genus of island kingfishers (Aves: Todiramphus) as its study system. This project aims to make broadly applicable and generalizable predictions about the speciation process. The outcomes of this project will be a model for future speciation research in the Pacific and serve as a springboard for pioneering new ways of studying complex phenotypes and their interactions with nature. This project will engage the public through virtual and face-to-face experiences. The researchers will create virtual collections experiences (VCEs) that highlight the associated natural history collections at the Museum of Southwestern Biology and The Field Museum. These online tools will reveal how data are collected from specimens and used to address the project?s research objectives. The VCEs will be developed as education modules for grades 9?12, complete with lesson plans and student learning outcomes. The researchers will development a highly multisensory exhibit at The Field Museum, playing on the project?s themes of color evolution that will reach an estimated 500,000 people in Chicago. An educational workshop will be held at the Museum of Southwestern Biology that will provide hands-on training and experience in biodiversity science to Native American and Hispanic students from UNM and New Mexico?s rural-area institutions. It will showcase professional opportunities in STEM with a focus on museum-based biodiversity science.<br/><br/>Speciation genomics addresses the roles of ecology, gene flow, and genomic architecture in the formation of species. This project proposes an integrative study of systematics, biogeography, plumage diversification, and ecological adaptation to test multiple hypotheses of the factors that promoted rapid diversification in a diverse and widespread radiation of island kingfishers. Todiramphus kingfishers occur across the entire Indo-Pacific and their diversification rate rivals those of ?classic? adaptive radiations. This study system provides replicated instances of sympatry and isolation, as well as divergent ecologies required for a synthetic study of diversification. The project will generate diverse datasets including whole genomes, ecological niche models, and phenotypic traits, to study how these factors facilitated rapid radiation on islands over the last 10 million years. The proposed research will leverage this unique geographic context to provide novel insights into the multifaceted process of speciation by (a) quantifying the presence and extent of gene flow and how novel changes in genomic architecture influenced diversification; (b) assessing how extrinsic traits (plumage coloration, biogeography, and relative niche conservatism) promoted or inhibited species divergence in the clade; and (c) through a novel test of the abundance-niche-center hypothesis in the context of genomic and phenotypic diversity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, recent studies have shown that when machine learning models are exposed to adversarial attacks, they can be fooled, evaded, and misled in ways that would have profound security implications: image recognition, natural language processing, and audio recognition systems have all been attacked recently. As machine learning techniques are incorporated into safety-critical systems, from financial systems to self-driving cars to medical diagnosis, it is vitally important to develop trustworthy and robust learning approaches for massive production and deployment of safety-critical machine learning applications. Although there have been exciting progresses in the area of robust learning, there is still a long way to go considering sophisticated real-world adversaries. Thus, in this project the investigator aims to gain fundamental understandings about adversarial properties and constraints, and develop machine learning systems with robustness guarantees for different real-world applications.<br/><br/>One limitation of existing learning methods is inherent in the fact that most existing methods have been treating machine learning as a ?pure data-driven technique? that solely depends on a given training-set, without interacting with their rich exogenous information that is not fully modeled by the data itself. This project aims to design novel techniques to incorporate exogenous information in machine learning systems. In particular, this project includes three aims, each of which addresses a unique challenge of understanding and integrating exogenous information to design robust machine learning systems: (1) the team of researchers will first focus on understanding of intrinsic information such as model viability and leverage it to design certifiably robust machine learning models/ensembles, (2) then the researchers will focus on the extrinsic information such as domain knowledge to design certifiably robust machine learning pipelines, (3) finally the researchers will apply the proposed techniques to two safety-critical applications, adversarial multimedia data detection and robust autonomous vehicles, to demonstrate the practicality of the proposed research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There are excellent protocols for the management and treatment of acute stroke, however, these protocols are only effective once patients have been admitted into the healthcare system. Ischemic stroke affects 700,000 Americans, costs approximately $33 billion annually, and is the fifth leading cause of death and a leading cause of disability in the US. Health care providers, however, have limited interaction with their patients, and these interactions occur in the highly constrained environment of the clinical setting. Physicians have limited control over patient behavior and limited tools to help patients recognize stroke symptoms outside the clinical setting. For patients with high stroke risk, there is currently no system available to monitor stroke symptoms and initiate a response in real-time. Thus, there is a need to monitor patients remotely, where the current systems for stroke response fail to provide coverage. The proposed solution will expand the provision of stroke symptom monitoring to the daily lives of patients. Tracking patients as they go through their daily lives will considerably enrich our knowledge of stroke and will allow extension to monitoring for other neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders and diseases. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project addresses the real-time detection of stroke.  IV tissue plasminogen activator (tPA) has been an FDA approved therapy since 1995, yet only 5-10% of eligible patients receive this therapy. Arrival time in the emergency room after initial stroke symptoms is directly associated with better outcomes after tPA and endovascular therapy, with a time window of 4.5 hours and 24 hours for these treatments, respectively. Despite massive public health campaigns, identifying symptoms of stroke and activating emergency response systems remains a major challenge. The goal of this project is to develop and test a wearable and computational solution to effectively alert ischemic stroke victims and initiate emergency response in a timely manner. The solution consists of a cloud-based analysis system for real-time detection of stroke onset, enabled by body-worn sensors and a mobile app. Once deployed, the device is expected to dramatically improve stroke emergency response and increase the number of patients arriving in the hospital in time for IV tPA treatment and other reperfusion therapies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current standards for public-key ciphers are based on large number factorization or discrete logarithm, which can be solved in polynomial time by a quantum computing algorithm. Substantial advancements have been made on quantum processors recently and there is imminent need of new cryptography schemes that are secure against quantum computing attacks. The team will make advances in error-correction code (ECC)-based McEliece/Niederreiter cryptography. The approach will be based on low or medium-density parity-check (LDPC or MDPC) ECCs that are among the most promising schemes resistant to quantum computing attacks. The advances will be achieved by coupling research on cryptography and error-correction coding theory, thus eliminating possible backdoors and attacks for these ciphers. The team will also develop efficient and secure hardware implementations that are indispensable in order to adopt the ECC-based ciphers broadly in practical systems. The new challenges posed by the different constructions of LDPC/MDPC codes for cryptographic purposes will be addressed and advanced decoding algorithms will be investigated to unleash the performance potential of these cryptosystems. Additionally, low-overhead schemes will be developed to prevent the leakage of secret key from side-channel information, such as the timing and power consumption of the circuit chip implementing the cipher. This project will also contribute to the development of workforce skilled in coding, cryptography and hardware architecture design for the growing security needs in the US. The participating students will receive advanced training in engineering, and their educational experiences will be enriched by close collaboration between the PIs and their international collaborators.<br/><br/>This proposal fills the gaps among the research on cryptography, error-correction coding theory, and hardware architecture design for the ECC-based post-quantum McEliece/Niederreiter cryptosystems. Efficient and highly secure hardware implementations will be developed through integrating theoretical study, attack analysis, and hardware architecture design. Such a cross-layer design approach enables the development of unprecedented short-latency, small-area, low-power, and secure ECC-based cryptosystems. For the first time, possible attacks from coding theoretical perspective will be studied comprehensively and low-overhead mitigation methodologies will be developed for existing and new potential attacks. Taking into account the specifics of the codes utilized in the ECC-based cryptosystems, novel approaches and decoding scheduling schemes will be designed to substantially improve the hardware efficiency. A framework of design and implementation of the ECC-based cryptosystems satisfying various system constraints, such as latency, silicon area, and power consumption, will be developed to enable broad application of post-quantum cryptography. Moreover, algorithmic-level side-channel attack resistant approaches, which have much lower overheads compared to circuit-level methodologies, will be developed by exploiting the variations of LDPC/MDPC decoding data flow and scheduling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Caldera collapse occurs during both explosive and lava flow forming eruptions; both are fortunately relatively rare.  The 2018 eruption of K?lauea volcano in Hawai?i destroyed 700 homes and led to $800 million in damage. The associated caldera collapse was by far the best monitored in history.  In 2.5 months, the floor of the centuries-old caldera, within Hawai?i Volcanoes National Park, dropped up to 500 meters and increased in volume by 0.8 km3.  It is crucial to understand the collapse process because the weight of the overlying crust acts to sustain these eruptions.  While the basics of caldera collapse are understood, the unprecedented data collected in 2018 will allow us to address first order questions, including: What are the crustal stress and magma pressure conditions necessary for collapse?  What is the sub-surface geometry of the ring fault system bounding the collapse? Why did collapse occur in discrete events, and what physical properties controlled the character of these events?  What is the nature of sub-caldera magma storage systems and how do they connect to the eruptive vents? Modeling of these unique data will lead to a quantitative leap in our understanding of caldera collapse. The project will support a graduate student to understand volcanic hazards in the U.S.<br/><br/>The 2018 collapse of occurred in 62 discrete events in which the caldera dropped from several to nearly 10 meters, accompanied by magnitude 5.2 to 5.4 earthquakes.  Collapses were accompanied by remarkable, inflationary deformation offsets followed by decelerating deflations, similar to behavior at other basaltic caldera collapses.  There has been considerable debate as to whether caldera ring-faults are inward or outward dipping.  This project will use finite element (FEM) modeling combined with inversion of high-rate GPS data to constrain the ring-fault dip and the compressibility, and hence vesicularity, of the underlying magma.  The research will further use  pre- co-, and in particular post-collapse GPS and InSAR data to  constrain the geometry, size and connectivity of the enigmatic summit magma system.  The dynamics of collapse are analyzed with a model in which the weight of the caldera block is balanced by magma pressure at its base and rate-and-state dependent friction on its sides.  Flow of magma is driven by the pressure difference between the magma chamber and the eruption site.  Model predictions of repeated collapse events are compared to the time between events, their duration, displacement, and magma chamber pressure increase.   The model elucidates the conditions for caldera collapse, and how collapse sustains eruptions that would otherwise cease.  The measured surges in eruptive flux will be used to further constrain pressures within the magma system. Our analysis of co-collapse deformation leads naturally to a model for the VLP earthquakes.  Synthetic waveforms will be computed that can be compared to low-pass filtered seismic observations.  A striking correlation of cumulative VT seismicity with inter-collapse subsidence strongly suggests fault creep on the ring-fault prior to collapse, providing insights into fault development and chamber pressure history.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The curious paradox of chemistry is that the chemical intermediates of greatest relevance are necessarily present in vanishingly low concentrations and therefore require higher and higher sensitivity detection methods to observe. Nowhere are these sensitivity needs more pronounced than at the gas-liquid interface, whereby an ultrathin layer (10-7 cm) serves as the ?doorway? between molecules in the gas phase and deep inside the bulk liquid. The proposed research is directed towards systematic exploration of such interfaces, exploiting high resolution laser spectroscopy and molecular beam tools to ?bounce? molecules from liquids and probing the chemical composition, vibrational, rotational, speeds, and directions in which the product scatters from the surface.  Prof. Nesbitt is continuing his 31st-33rd years as director of the CU Wizards Science Outreach program, which entails organizing 10 demo-filled science presentations each academic year (from September to June) for children in lower and middle school, in areas of science ranging from Black Holes to the Physics of Cooking to the What's Behind Climate Change? <br/><br/>In particular, the proposed studies are exploiting supersonic expansions of simple molecules (e.g., DCl, HCl, CO, CO2, OCS, NO) moving at up to 2000 m/s (2-10x faster than the speed of sound) colliding with simple liquids (e.g., water, salty water, glycerin, hydrocarbon oils, molten salts, and even molten gold at 1100 C!). Nesbitt?s students are utilizing high resolution laser spectroscopy to explore how cold molecular projectiles ?warm up to? and even significantly exceed the temperature of the bulk liquid. These results turn out to depend sensitively on and therefore quantitatively probe the nature of this thin interfacial layer (e.g., is it ?rough? vs ?smooth?, ?soft? vs ?hard?, ?acidic? or ?basic?, or ?water-hating? (hydrophobic) vs. ?water-loving? (hydrophilic), etc.), thereby providing detailed insights into the collision dynamics and chemistry of molecules at interfaces. This is relevant to how, for example, molecules such as O2 and CO2 cross through the lungs, dissolve into the blood stream, and eventually enter/leave the cells in any living organism. The gas-liquid interface is arguably the least well understood phase of matter and yet represents the sole ?portal? through which gas molecules can dissolve into (or be expelled out of) a liquid. The gas-liquid interface thus represents a new scientific frontier about which remarkably little is known, but which nevertheless has impacts in areas as disparate as pulmonary medicine, ocean surface layer chemistry, atmospheric aerosol chemistry, ozone hole formation, and global climate change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are distinct from standard aftershock sequences ? series of small earthquakes following large earthquakes - in that they appear to be driven by non-tectonic factors. Recent analysis suggests that the most likely processes triggering earthquake swarms are fluid migration within Earth?s crust, and slow fault creep events. Here, the researchers examined data collected across Southern California between 2008 and 2020. They used machine learning algorithms which allow extracting small earthquake signals from the seismic noise. They discovered hundreds of unknown swarms that lasted 6 months to several years in duration. The team now analyze these newly identified sequences to quantify their collective spatial and temporal patterns.  One goal is to identify if there are generalizable characteristics.  Another goal is to characterize the underlying driving processes and document where and how often these swarms occur. The study aims to provide a more comprehensive regional context for the role of non-tectonic factors in driving earthquake activity. One of its outcomes is a publicly searchable high-resolution catalog of recent earthquake swarms in Southern California.  The project also provide support for one graduate student and outreach to K-12 students and the public. It is funded by both NSF Geophysics and Geoinformatics programs.<br/><br/>Earthquake swarms are believed to be driven mainly by aseismic processes. The spatiotemporal evolution of these sequences therefore encodes unique information: the structural and permeability architecture of fault zones, the aseismic processes responsible, and the coupling between fault properties and earthquake physics. Here, the researchers leveraged recent advances in earthquake monitoring capabilities with deep learning algorithms. They showed that during the last decade, Southern California has experienced hundreds of previously unknown swarm episodes that persist for months to years. These earthquake microswarms are now used to map the potential origins of fluids deep within the seismogenic crust and to quantify the frequency and duration of these transient episodes. The timing of the initiation and arrest of microswarms will be examined systematically for connections to the largest regional events. Furthermore, the large collection of microswarms will be used to provide constraints on the geometrical, structural, and permeability architecture of the fault zones at depth. These data are critical to understanding the complex evolution of earthquake swarms in space and time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will engage students in hands-on field experience, laboratory/project-based entrepreneurship tasks and mentorship experiences in fields of computing, specifically in cybersecurity. This project, based on the use of a Project Based Learning (PBL) environment with high school students, is a partnership between Tuskegee University, Auburn University, a rural and an urban school district in the historic Black Belt region of the state of Alabama, Tuskegee University Engineering and Computer Science Alumni Associations, and the Alabama State Department of Education. The focus of the partnership is to recruit annually a cohort of forty ethnically and racially diverse high school students from the partnering school districts for immersion in a STEM intensive PBL four-week STEM Summer Academy hosted by Tuskegee University, followed by one semester in-school training. The Academy is designed to provide 40 rising 10th and 11th grade students and ten high-school teachers annually (150 over the life of the three-year grant) with far-reaching technological experiences through the exciting exploration of secured mobile application development under a PBL framework. <br/><br/>The project will provide, in a group setting, hands-on training in basic information technology and information security concepts through a one-month training program (4-week Summer Academy) hosted at Tuskegee University, a Historically Black University, followed by one semester in school training on a project of their choice.  Each of the groups will be assisted by a computer science faculty of Tuskegee University. The students develop a secured mobile application using the MIT APP Inventor environment and test it using an android phone. The key questions being addressed are: (1) To what extent does the innovative four-week technology-oriented experience in a PBL environment followed by one semester in-school training impact minority high school students? knowledge, interest, motivation, and attitudes towards STEM-related careers? (2) In what ways does the collaborative small group experience with mentor teachers affect minority high school students? interest and awareness of STEM-related careers? (3) To what extent do the effects of the program persist after its completion? Do they lead to STEM-related post-secondary plans?  (4) What instructional and mentoring strategies can be effectively integrated in to boost minority high school students? knowledge, interest, and attitudes towards STEM-related careers? A mixed-method design with both qualitative and quantitative data will be used to examine the students' motivation and attitude towards STEM in a PBL environment.

Coastal intertidal zones (i.e., the shore between high and low tides) have long served as important ecological model systems because of advantages in accessibility and ease of observation, occupancy by easily studied and manipulated organisms of relatively short lifespans, and exposure to often severe environmental conditions. This research will address the stability of a well-known rocky shore system along the Oregon and California coasts. Prior long-term research indicates that, although casual observation suggests these systems are stable, in fact, they may be on the cusp of shifting into another state, losing iconic organisms like mussels and sea stars, and becoming dominated by seaweeds. These changes might be comparable to losing trees and large predators from terrestrial systems. This study would result in the training of undergraduates and graduate students, including individuals from under-represented groups.  Additionally, this study would include outreach to the general public.<br/><br/>The researchers will focus particularly on impacts of increasing and more variable warming on community recovery. For example, climate oscillations (e.g., El Nio), coastal upwelling, and particularly temperature have all changed in recent decades in ways leading to increased stress on intertidal biota. In apparent response, coastal ecosystems evidently have become less productive, organismal performance (growth, reproduction) has declined, and key dynamical processes (species interactions) have weakened. The new research will pursue these strong hints of an impending ?tipping point? by (1) continuing the projects that led to the insights of increasing instability, (2) adding new projects that will pinpoint ecological changes, and (3) expanding the region of work to include locations in California. Research will assess whether or not sea stars recover from wasting disease, experimentally test if species interactions are indeed weakening, quantify the annual inputs of new prey and changes in abundance, diversity, stability, and resilience of intertidal communities, and document changes in the physical environment. Using field observations and experiments, the research will provide insight into impacts of environmental change, particularly warming, on the future of coastal ecosystems, and more generally, into possible future states of Earth?s ecosystems. Using these data, we will test the hypothesis that direct and indirect effects of climate change are driving, or may drive these systems into new, alternative states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Encouraging the participation of these students in STEM graduate programs will significantly benefit the creativity of our professional workforce, which in turn will help to identify groundbreaking solutions to the large-scale and complex scientific and technological challenges facing the nation. In addition to supporting national prosperity and competitiveness, increasing the participation of neurodiverse individuals in graduate programs will significantly benefit the well-being of these marginalized individuals who are currently highly underrepresented in STEM education. This National Science Foundation Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Connecticut will embrace a strength-based approach towards neurodiversity. By identifying the nature of the challenges that neurodiverse students face in the prevailing one-size-fits-all model of STEM graduate education, this project aims to pilot and test innovative approaches to improve the sense of belonging, productivity, and overall experience of neurodiverse graduate students. In doing so, this project will generate knowledge that informs the development of more inclusive educational practices that capitalize on the unique talents of neurodiverse individuals. These practices will support the academic success of neurodiverse students and empower these individuals to contribute to future scientific and technological advancements. Changing the paradigm of disability, dysfunction, and disorder to one of diversity not only enhances the participation of nontraditional learners in STEM education but also benefits society and the nation at large.<br/><br/>By adopting a strength-based approach toward neurodiversity, this project will be at the forefront of efforts to promote a culture of inclusivity in STEM graduate education. Toward this end, the project employs a theory of change model with four integrated activities to pilot and test easy-to-implement interventions with high potential to support the success of students with ADHD and dyslexia in STEM graduate programs. Activities will encourage participation of these populations of students by adopting a strength-based approach toward neurodiversity. This project aims to evaluate three core hypotheses: 1) increasing neurodiverse students? awareness of their unique strengths and challenges enhances their self-efficacy and self-advocacy, 2) providing opportunities for peer-to-peer interaction enhances the sense of belonging and experience of neurodiverse students in STEM graduate programs, and 3) providing writing interventions focused on students? metacognitive skills enhances their writing productivity. The data from the integrated research plan and formal evaluation will generate critical knowledge for the scale-up of the proposed activities and inform future enhancements of STEM graduate education. This project will generate data on the efficacy of evidence-based approaches and interventions that are inspired by the framework of positive psychology to inform the development of an inclusive graduate education environment. This knowledge will be shared with engineering educators through a workshop at the ASEE annual meeting and formal publications. Supported by a strong institutional commitment, the multidisciplinary team of principal investigators and the diverse project advisory board composed of university administrators, researchers, industry leaders, philanthropists, and graduate students will guide the recruitment, data collection, data analysis, dissemination, and outreach activities of the project.<br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, despite significant advances, many models still lack realistic representations of human behavior and mobility, which are key drivers of disease spread. Without accounting for the complexity of human behavior, models are limited in their ability to make accurate predictions, especially over longer time horizons. This project investigates the inclusion of realistic human behavior and mobility in models of disease spread to 1) better explain the different ways that humans respond to disease outbreaks, 2) improve predictions of infectious disease spread, and 3) help to prescribe the most effective mitigation policies. The investigators use publicly available data so that models can be rapidly deployed for any county or state in the U.S. to predict and mitigate future outbreaks of infectious respiratory diseases (e.g., COVID-19, seasonal influenza, measles, and smallpox). These models may provide more timely and accurate predictions to help the general public, key institutions, and policymakers anticipate what is to come and provide support for evidence-based policy making. This project will support professional development and training opportunities for a postdoctoral researcher, graduate, undergraduate, and high school students in the Aspiring Scientists Summer Internship program.<br/><br/>The researchers will use a data-driven approach to explain the spatio-temporal variations in the behavioral response to a disease outbreak. They hypothesize that regional variables such as average income, age, political leaning are associated with spatial patterns of behavioral response, and will leverage very large data sets to mine association rules between such variables and observed behavioral response, including social distancing, stay-at-home behavior, mask usage, and vaccine acceptance. These association rules will be used to develop a novel modeling framework that captures spatio-temporal variations of human response to disease. The proposed modeling framework will be implemented to simulate the spread of COVID-19 using Fairfax County, VA, as a case study. This framework also will be leveraged for prescriptive analytics to find the best course of action in the event of future infectious disease outbreaks. The researchers will simulate and optimize policy measures aimed at mitigating disease spread and minimizing socio-economic impact. This optimization will combine automatic optimization tools with the expertise of researchers in policy, epidemiology, health geography, and psychology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advances in single?agent RL algorithms sparked new interest in multi-agent RL (MARL). The goal of this project is to build robust, secure algorithms for autonomous systems that are built using MARL. The project team will investigate a novel threat that can be exploited simply by designing an adversarial plan for an agent acting in a cooperative multi?agent environment so as to create natural observations that are adversarial to one or more of its allies. For example, in connected autonomous vehicles, one compromised vehicle can<br/>drastically disrupt security, causing confusion and mistakes that result in poor performance and even harm to humans who rely on these systems. The project team will build a robust MARL algorithm to such adversarial manipulations. The educational plan for this project includes developing a suit of tutorials on analyzing the security and robustness of MARL algorithms, designed for use in a graduate course or as a tool for MARL researchers. The project team will also contribute to educational outreach by involving graduate and undergraduate students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The project is built upon three overarching objectives (1) study how attackers can exploit MARL vulnerabilities,(2) develop a more robust MARL algorithm by training each agent using the counterfactual reasoning about other agents? behaviors, and (3) create a novel online formal verification method to satisfy the security and safety requirements during the execution of our proposed MARL algorithm. More specifically, for the first objective, the project team will prove the feasibility of using a compromised agent to attack its allies in MARL systems through its actions. The second objective will reverse?engineer the attack strategies to develop a robust MARL algorithm that models the agents? behaviors during training and correlates their actions using counterfactual reasoning. In the third objective, an online formal verification model will be developed to detect any deviations in agents? behaviors using a predefined set of security and safety specifications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current standards for public-key ciphers are based on large number factorization or discrete logarithm, which can be solved in polynomial time by a quantum computing algorithm. Substantial advancements have been made on quantum processors recently and there is imminent need of new cryptography schemes that are secure against quantum computing attacks. The team will make advances in error-correction code (ECC)-based McEliece/Niederreiter cryptography. The approach will be based on low or medium-density parity-check (LDPC or MDPC) ECCs that are among the most promising schemes resistant to quantum computing attacks. The advances will be achieved by coupling research on cryptography and error-correction coding theory, thus eliminating possible backdoors and attacks for these ciphers. The team will also develop efficient and secure hardware implementations that are indispensable in order to adopt the ECC-based ciphers broadly in practical systems. The new challenges posed by the different constructions of LDPC/MDPC codes for cryptographic purposes will be addressed and advanced decoding algorithms will be investigated to unleash the performance potential of these cryptosystems. Additionally, low-overhead schemes will be developed to prevent the leakage of secret key from side-channel information, such as the timing and power consumption of the circuit chip implementing the cipher. This project will also contribute to the development of workforce skilled in coding, cryptography and hardware architecture design for the growing security needs in the US. The participating students will receive advanced training in engineering, and their educational experiences will be enriched by close collaboration between the PIs and their international collaborators.<br/><br/>This proposal fills the gaps among the research on cryptography, error-correction coding theory, and hardware architecture design for the ECC-based post-quantum McEliece/Niederreiter cryptosystems. Efficient and highly secure hardware implementations will be developed through integrating theoretical study, attack analysis, and hardware architecture design. Such a cross-layer design approach enables the development of unprecedented short-latency, small-area, low-power, and secure ECC-based cryptosystems. For the first time, possible attacks from coding theoretical perspective will be studied comprehensively and low-overhead mitigation methodologies will be developed for existing and new potential attacks. Taking into account the specifics of the codes utilized in the ECC-based cryptosystems, novel approaches and decoding scheduling schemes will be designed to substantially improve the hardware efficiency. A framework of design and implementation of the ECC-based cryptosystems satisfying various system constraints, such as latency, silicon area, and power consumption, will be developed to enable broad application of post-quantum cryptography. Moreover, algorithmic-level side-channel attack resistant approaches, which have much lower overheads compared to circuit-level methodologies, will be developed by exploiting the variations of LDPC/MDPC decoding data flow and scheduling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By updating and expanding the Dimensions of Success (DoS) observation tool initially established for informal science learning settings to middle school science and engineering classrooms (DoS-MSSE), the project will create and implement a sustainable and scalable system of support for teachers who are learning how to implement the Next Generation Science Standards (NGSS) Framework for K-12 effectively and equitably. The project?s goals are as follows.  (1) Develop and test the DoS-MSSE observation tool, including alignment to the NGSS and equity, to ensure scores are valid and reliable across all dimensions. (2) Establish a video scoring method to increase access to continuous improvement systems of support.  (3) Create profiles of STEM quality for schools and districts to  inform policy decisions, professional development opportunities, practice guidelines, and other efforts.  (4) Develop and implement a training program to certify teachers and staff in the use of the tool and provide professional development. Extending DoS to middle schools will support and advancing educational practice by identifying schools? strengths and challenges in science and engineering learning, making equity more concrete, and enhancing school and teacher capacity through established DoS systems of support. The tool will be developed to assess learning experiences for quality improvement, not used for accountability or comparison. DoS-MSSE will also support research and evaluation by providing a validated quality assessment tool, specific to middle school science and engineering, that is flexible and can be applied to a variety of proposals and projects, enhancing research infrastructure. Finally, it will improve the STEM education field by providing stakeholders with ?quality profiles? to guide policy and approaches. By promoting equitable, high-quality science and engineering learning inside and outside of school, the expanded DoS framework will strengthen efforts across sectors and help communities provide the inspiration, knowledge, and skills youth need to thrive in the workforce and in life.<br/><br/>Over four years, this project will transform the DoS framework to address multiple educational priorities for formal middle school settings by: (1) creating a new domain that aligns to science and engineering practices, disciplinary core ideas, and cross-cutting concepts from the NGSS/Framework for K-12; (2) identifying observable and measurable diversity, equity, inclusion, and access practices (and related indicators, including social-emotional learning and development) in the context of science and engineering in classrooms, and further revising rubric criteria. The project will build a validity argument for DoS-MSSE using established methods for observation protocols, and analyze the psychometric properties of all dimensions and domains using item-response theory (IRT) methods (e.g., Many-Faceted Rasch Measurement, to model the         data which will allow for estimation of teachers? effectiveness, rater severity, and the difficulty of each dimension). The rubrics will be informed by content experts and pilot observations; scores will be analyzed across dimensions, observers, disciplinary domains, and time; and scores will be compared to other data, including student and teacher self-report and observation scores collected with other established measures. The project will culminate in a larger-scale validation study, collecting observational and survey data from three geographically different school districts (N=30 schools). This effort will characterize the strength of evidence for indicators of classroom quality and provide data to identify support needs across districts, schools, and teachers. Given the ongoing need for remote learning, and the general need to increase school capacity for non-punitive assessment, the tool will be expanded to support both live and recorded modes of data collection, establishing a video scoring method. A training and certification system will be field-tested in the fourth year of the project to assure accessibility, scalability, and sustainability.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

It is well known that the rates and selectivities of chemical reactions occurring on metal surfaces are determined by catalyst surface structure.  Ideally, the design of catalysts would identify surface structures that optimize the yield of desired products.  However, it is experimentally challenging to map reactivity comprehensively across the many possible structures of a metal surface.  Gellman and Sykes have developed a complementary set of tools to measure surface reaction kinetics and to image atomistic surface structure across hundreds of different surface orientations concurrently.  These methods will be used to generate datasets that will be used by catalyst developers to design new and improved catalytic materials.  Students working on this project are gaining valuable skills in the fields of surface chemistry, x-ray spectroscopy and scanning probe microscopy.<br/><br/>Gellman and Sykes are using spherically curved Cu and Ag single crystals that expose hundreds of different Cu(hkl) and Ag(hkl) surfaces as sample libraries for the study of surface structure and reactivity.  Gellman is using spatially resolved x-ray photoemission spectroscopy to measure the rates of isothermal adsorption and activation of small molecules such as O2, CO2 and CH3CH2OH on hundreds of different Cu(hkl) and Ag(hkl) surfaces in order to identify the most active surface orientations and the trends correlating reactivity with surface structure.  Sykes is studying the structures of these surfaces before and after adsorption using scanning tunneling microscopy.  In addition, Gellman and Sykes are conducting similar measurements on surfaces modified by isolated atoms of metals such as Ni, Pd, and Pt to create single atom alloy catalysts with well-defined surface structures.  This work will inform efforts to develop predictive theoretical models for understanding structure sensitive catalytic surface chemistry.  This project also tests our current understanding of the mechanism of spillover in catalysis.

The Pacific Walker Circulation is a key feature of the climate system; it impacts temperature and rainfall worldwide, with important socioeconomic consequences. The late Pliocene is an attractive target for understanding sensitivity of Pacific Walker Circulation to changes in atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations because it features biome distributions, geography, and topography that are similar to the present-day. Carbon dioxide concentration decreased from roughly today?s level during the mid-Piacenzian (3.3 ? 3.0 million years ago) to around the preindustrial level during the early-Pleistocene (<2.58 million years ago), coincident with (and perhaps driving) the expansion of Northern Hemisphere ice sheets. The study will produce new geochemical data (sedimentary leaf wax isotope data from both western and eastern sides of the tropical Pacific) and will develop water isotopologue tracking enabled Earth System Model simulations to investigate Pacific Walker Circulation sensitivity to late-Pliocene changes in carbon dioxide concentrations and ice sheets. The products will contribute to the existing archives of Pliocene Earth System simulations and observations, providing a community resource for future research and education. A collection of educational activities at high school, undergraduate, and graduate level are also planned to train next generation climate scientists.<br/><br/>	Strengthening of the Pacific Walker Circulation in response to carbon dioxide increase is a common prediction from atmosphere-ocean coupled Earth System Models. Yet, confidence in this prediction is low due to the short duration of instrumental records, which only chronicle a narrow range of transient climate responses to carbon dioxide increase. This project aims to test model predictions of changes in Pacific Walker Circulation during the late-Pliocene with measurements of deuterium concentrations of sedimentary leaf wax from both western and eastern sides of the tropical Pacific. The team will develop a series of water isotopologue tracking enabled Earth System Model simulations and leaf wax records to understand 1) whether a weaker Pacific Walker Circulation existed during the mid-Piacenzian; 2) what is the sensitivity of Pacific Walker Circulation to carbon dioxide decline during the late-Pliocene; and 3) if the early-Pleistocene glacial expansion strengthened the Pacific Walker Circulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because organisms may have different sensitivities to changes in temperature and rainfall, associated differences in the timing of their life events may lead to the 'reshuffling' of communities. In other words, these changes in the phenologies of organisms may lead some species to interact with new partners and lose their relationships others.  This project will examine how changes in the timing of life events of plants may influence their competition with other plants, which in turn may influence the types of plants that will be found in an area.

The project will provide STEM undergraduate students with opportunities to work with K-12 students on STEM projects.  This experience is expected to help many of the undergraduates decide to pursue STEM teaching as a career. Once these STEM undergraduate students are on a path to become high school STEM teachers, they will be immersed in additional community and industry experiences, such as summer science camps. By combining these experiences with field experiences in schools, the project aims to build a network of STEM, industry, and education mentors. The mentors will be positioned to guide the prospective STEM teachers through their preparation for teaching and their introductory years as STEM teachers.

The project goal is to recruit and prepare 22 new biology, math, and chemistry secondary teachers by recruiting undergraduate STEM majors into teaching careers. The project's prospective teachers will be matched with a selected cadre of STEM teachers who will serve as mentors. While working at STEM community events, the prospective teachers will have an opportunity to develop an understanding of the contexts of K-12 students? lives. Through STEM industry externships, the prospective teachers will learn how to connect local STEM jobs to the STEM content they are teaching and will broaden their network of STEM mentors. Through focus group interviews with stakeholders, surveys, and analysis of observational data, the scientific and education communities will develop an understanding of the impact of mentoring, community engagement, and industry immersion on the preparation and retention of STEM teachers. Increasing teacher's knowledge about the community in which they serve will be the most important broader impact of this work. The network that has been created between teachers and industry has potential to help change the perceptions of advanced manufacturing careers, a focus of the community. Prospective teachers will share their industry experiences at community organizations, which may increase the sustainability of the program beyond the life of the project.

The soil microbiome, including fungal communities, contributes to weathering by disrupting, dissolving, and extracting nutrients from mineral grains. Fungi seek out nutrients and water sources by spreading networks of exploratory hyphae across a soil landscape. However, identifying the mechanisms used by fungi to transform minerals to extract rock-derived nutrients remains challenging, especially in natural soils that span different climates, rock types, and ecosystems. The goal of the research is to understand how fungi interact with abiotic environments to initiate mineral weathering and form soil in Earth?s critical zone. This project will utilize recent advances in high resolution microscopy and mass spectrometry to examine fungi interacting with mineral surfaces at micro-to nano-scale resolutions. The results will demonstrate how new technologies can promote the progress of the earth and environmental sciences in combination with an Integrated Critical Zone Model. The project findings will bring economic and societal benefits with respect to soil preservation, agricultural activity, and bio-engineering given the ubiquitous nature of soil fungi in the environment. This research will be integrated with the educational goal to diversify, recruit, and retain community college students in the (geo)sciences academic pipeline by implementing: Soils & Outreach for Integrated Learning & Self-Efficacy (SOILS) Bridge. The bridge program will enhance academic and social resources for incoming college students through tiered mentoring, training in the field and lab, and K-12 outreach. <br/><br/>This work will probe into fungal-mineral interactions across spatial scales to answer unresolved questions related to fungal impact on mineral transformations and contributions to nutrient cycling.

It will do so by supporting the retention and graduation of high-achieving, low-income students with demonstrated financial need at Denison University, a private, liberal arts college. Over its five-year duration, this project will provide scholarships to 32 undergraduate students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in Biology, Biochemistry, Chemistry, Geosciences, Mathematics, or Computer Science. These Scholars will be admitted in four cohorts of eight students and receive up to four years of scholarship support.  The project aims to increase student graduation in STEM fields by linking scholarships to a multilevel mentoring program designed to help students acclimate to campus, progress academically, grow as researchers, and prepare for the STEM workforce. This project has the potential to increase understanding about how to broaden participation in STEM fields and to learn how multilevel mentoring can support retention and graduation of low-income students in STEM.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to increase degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates in STEM fields. The four primary aims of the project are to: (1) provide financial support to low-income students; (2) create a cohort structure designed to increase Scholars' feelings of belonging; (3) Implement a multilevel program of peer, academic, research, and career mentoring; and (4) engage in formal assessment and evaluation to explore the role of mentoring in developing Scholars' sense of belonging, science identity, and metacognition, while also increasing persistence and STEM graduation. Though each component of this project has been demonstrated to affect student persistence in STEM, little is known about the use of multilevel mentoring on metacognition and science identity. As such, this project may increase understanding about how effective mentoring may support STEM student success by affecting key factors such as science identity and metacognition. Project results will be made available through an established regional network of liberal arts colleges, presentations at national professional conferences and publications in venues focused on post-secondary STEM education. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the biggest challenges in designing the system software that supports these services is engineering the components of the software infrastructure to scale to handle extremely large workloads. Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA) is an important technology to improve achievable scalability. RDMA allows servers to access remote server memory without interrupting their execution resulting on more efficient communication and the ability to serve massive numbers of user requests. This project studies synchronization.  Synchronization is a barrier to scalability as it entails significant additional computation in order to coordinate among multiple entities but is mandatory to ensure data integrity. In particular, synchronization typically requires two-sided communication where the remote machine responds to data access requests.  This proposal investigates one-sided RDMA-optimized high-performance synchronization techniques and will demonstrate how they can be realized in easy-to-use abstractions to develop infrastructural system software.<br/><br/>The outcomes of this project are techniques that allow both specialized and non-expert programmers to build services that can exploit RDMA to handle millions of user requests without sacrificing performance. By leveraging the infrastructural software delivered as a result of this project, developers can focus most of their work on the core business logic of the service. The principles and findings of the project contribute to a twofold goal. First, they form a solid foundation to instruct future generations of developers who yearn for delivering services that target society at large. Second, they abstract away the challenging details, allowing programmers to leverage the project's solutions regardless of their technical depth in the realm of RDMA and synchronization. This not only simplifies the implementation of large high-performance services, but also evens the playing field between those who have the resources to tackle complex problems, and those who do not.  These research outcomes will be formalized in teaching material and tools for graduate and undergraduate courses and K-12 activities through a broad education plan designed to encourage students towards computer science study with a path towards graduate study and to broaden participation and increase diversity in computer science, especially for women.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) are envisioned as key components of 5G wireless technology and beyond: thanks to their low cost, improved line-of-sight over terrestrial base stations, and controllable mobility, they will enable low-cost wireless broadband access. Nonetheless, UAVs? integration into wireless networks poses unique challenges on the network and physical layers, due to the intricate coupling between trajectory design and communication resources to be jointly optimized, and uncertain air-to-ground channel propagation conditions. Furthermore, UAVs need to seamlessly operate under sources of randomness and uncertainty typical of wireless networks. This project aims to design techniques to enable real-time physical-layer adaptation of the communication resources, and adaptive trajectory designs to optimize communication performance and energy-efficiency of the system. This research addresses the global industrial and societal need for ubiquitous wireless broadband access by enabling a cost-effective integration of UAVs into wireless networks. This research integrates an educational and outreach program designed to foster research interests and participation of underrepresented students in electrical engineering, through activities created in collaboration with programs at ASU and local high schools.<br/><br/>This project develops a novel decision-making framework to address the critical need for adaptation in UAV-assisted wireless networks operating under uncertainty. Adaptive techniques are developed that leverage the high mobility of UAVs to optimize communication metrics such as latency, throughput, outage probability, area spectral efficiency, energy efficiency, by focusing on the interplay between network-level optimization and physical-layer communication, trajectory design, and control. A key novelty is a multi-scale decision framework to achieve scalable design. The framework leverages multiple spatio-temporal scales induced by the coupling between trajectory and channel propagation conditions to centralize slow timescale trajectory decisions and decentralize fast timescale communications decisions. The design aspect leverages unique features of single- and multi-antennas, operating at sub-6GHz or millimeter-wave frequencies, and provides adaptation to uncertain and dynamic channel conditions. The second goal consists of designing adaptive multi-UAV wireless systems, including UAV selection, user association, resource allocation, optimal charging schedules to enable uninterrupted operation, and contention-based access schemes to improve coverage and grant-free access. The research results are tested experimentally on NSF PAWR AERPAW by designing a software-defined-radio implementation.

Current dental diagnosis largely relies on dental X-ray/CT (computed tomography), with several major drawbacks: 1) current dental X-ray/CT fails to detect some critical diseases with high incidence rates: for instance, 34-74% of people have tooth cracks. Due to highly variable symptoms, crack is notoriously difficult to be diagnosed even for experienced dentists. 2) the ionizing radiation of dental X-ray was found to increase the risk of meningioma, thyroid cancer, and delivery of low-birth-weight baby. Ionizing radiation is more concerned in children, as they are required to take 3-6 times more frequent dental X-ray/CT, and in dental professionals, as they operate X-ray/CT much more frequently, than normal patients. 3) It is also challenging to hold bulky X-ray/CT sensor immobile by many people, such as children. This project is to address these drawbacks by developing a novel dental imaging scheme with a lab-designed sensitive near-infrared fluorescence photonic imaging system, consisting of a high-resolution camera and a spectroscopic device, for real-time dental imaging. In addition, this project will teach students and educate the general public on the cutting-edge bio-imaging knowledge to help them tackle practical challenges, such as COVID-19.<br/><br/>The project goal is to develop a sensitive near-infrared fluorescence imaging system, including a high-resolution camera and a spectroscopic device, together with nanofluorophore, to image critical dental structures and diseases, including those undetectable by state-of-the-art dental X-ray/CT, in real time, and to eliminate the risks of ionizing radiation and the necessity of biting bulky sensors immobile. To achieve the goal, the following approaches are to be used: 1) Design a high-resolution dental imaging system and study the fundamental mechanism of dye distribution in dental tissues and the impact of dye distribution on imaging performance; 2) Systematically compare this dental imaging scheme to other state-of-the-art imaging modalities on critical dental diseases and structures on both animal and human teeth; 3) Optimize the dental imaging strategy with indocyanine green delivery by mouthwash. The research activity of this project has intellectual significances in several aspects: A) This research advances interdisciplinary knowledge. First, this research may advance the fundamental understanding of bio-distributions of dye in soft and hard biomaterials. FDA-approved near-infrared dye, the indocyanine green, is well understood for the distribution into soft tissues via blood and lymphatic circulations. However, how indocyanine green is distributed into hard structures, such as teeth, remains unknown. This study will investigate the indocyanine green distribution approaches in hard structures, how the biodistribution is affected by imaging factors (for example, dye dosage, observation time) and how these factors may quantitatively impact the imaging performance. Second, this research advances the fundamental understanding of how hard and soft biostructures interacts with different electromagnetic waves (such as near-infrared I (700-1000 nm), near-infrared II (1000-1700 nm), and X-ray) and how these interactions impact the choice of electromagnetic waves and imaging parameters when imaging various dental diseases. B) This work is innovative in the field of dental imaging. This work employs FDA-approved indocyanine green as a biocompatible near-infrared II fluorophore to facilitate the translation of human applications, and a user-friendly ?mouthwash? delivery of dye, as opposed to the traditional intravenous injection; both are the pioneering works in the field. C) This work is transformative. In contrast with the current dental X-ray/CT (10-2-101 nm) imaging, this works uses completely different light (700-1700 nm) to eliminate the ionizing radiation, thus leading to the revolutionary change of dental practice by providing continuous real-time dental imaging at various angles/distances without health concerns.<br/><br/>This project is being jointly funded by Electrical, Communications and Cyber Systems (ECCS) in Engineering Directorate and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These traditional network security appliances often need to be placed at fixed network entry points and have a constant capacity with respect to the maximum amount of traffic they can process. Such rigid nature makes them inefficient in protecting today's prevailing programmable and virtualizable environments. Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and Software-Defined Networking (SDN) are two emerging networking paradigms that offer the potential to address those limitations and are able to facilitate elastic security with the design of a new breed of network security functions called virtual Network Security Functions (vNSFs). The major goal of this project is to extend the understanding and science of virtual Network Security Functions.  It will develop new technology for virtual Network Security Functions where security microservices can be deployed elastically, safely and efficiently, on demand, tailored to the needs of the situation. It addresses major challenges inherent in the management, design, deployment, and execution of virtual Network Security Functions that currently prevent the full use of their benefits.

Ubiquitous in mathematics, algebraic varieties are critical objects of study in complex geometry, number theory, topology, and representation theory. It is often particularly important to understand their moduli, that is, how they vary as the coefficients of the polynomial equations defining them are varied. Hodge theory offers one perspective on this problem: the moduli of algebraic varieties can be understood in terms of how integrals of differential forms vary. This research project will use new methods stemming from model theory, representation theory, and complex geometry to understand this connection. The project especially aims to promote interactions with closely-related areas of mathematics and to encourage the participation of students and young researchers.   <br/><br/>The project will address two main types of research problems.

Per emerging UAS Traffic Management (UTM) standards, a dedicated transit airspace layer will assure UAS are separated from manned aircraft traffic allowing UAS to focus on coordinating with each other.  The project is for a two-layer physics-based approach to route UAS as coordinated flow through high-density airspace transit channels.  At the top ""macroscopic"" coordination layer, UAS will be assigned to traffic channels based on their destinations and physical ability to coordinate flight paths with each other.  At the ""microscopic"" coordination layer, the existing continuum deformation cooperative control strategy will be extended to allow large-scale UAS groups to efficiently follow routes that respect airspace channel geometries backed by mathematical guarantees of collision avoidance.  The project also defines an interface between macroscopic and microscopic layers to deal with unpredicted events and UAS failure in a resilient fashion. The theoretical achievements of the project will be supported by large-scale simulations and flight experiments.   <br/><br/>The project offers a physics-inspired traffic coordination approach for Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) traffic management. The available physics-inspired approaches previously applied to highway traffic flow will be extended for low-altitude UAS traffic coordination in which no predefined paths exist. Airspace is considered a finite control volume in which coordinated UAS treated as a continuum deformation organize traffic flow within airspace channels prescribed by higher-level macroscopic coordination. Eulerian continuum mechanics efficiently defines macroscopic coordination as the solution of a parabolic partial differential equation (PDE) with spatiotemporal parameters. It is assumed vehicles operating in the planned airspace admit the nominal coordination, while unplanned airspace envelops no-fly zones and non-cooperative UAS. At the microscopic level, clustering vehicles is suggested based on vehicle performance limits. UAS clusters, with each UAS treated as a particle of a deformable body, use generalized leader-follower continuum deformation coordination to acquire the desired macroscopic coordination by local communication. This advances the existing theory by relaxing constraints on inter-agent communication topology and leaders' locations. The project's approach offers resilience to vehicle failures and rapid changes in airspace availability by formal safety analysis. Specifically, an adaptive boundary control algorithm will be developed to remove a non-cooperative or failed UAS from safely-coordinated channels in planned airspace.  Large-scale simulations and flight tests will be used to refine models and validate coordination concepts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
