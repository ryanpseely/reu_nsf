Participants in the workshop will develop the concept of ""biological normalcy"" by using a series of case studies to understand the relationships between statistical norms for, and normative social views of, biological variation within human populations, and the broader implications of these relationships. By bringing to light the normative (and often ethno-biocentric) language used to describe human biological variation, the goal of the workshop is to expose and reduce bias in discourse about biological variation and develop new ways of describing it. The language used to describe human variation has direct relevance to clinical and public health, where treatments and policies may be aimed at ""normalizing""  biological measures that are viewed as ""non-normal,"" deviant, or pathological. To maximize the impact of this workshop, time during the final phase will be dedicated to developing dissemination plans for each participant and the group, with an emphasis on academic, applied, and public outreach that will emphasize communication and education as well as public engagement.  <br/><br/>Biological normalcy serves as a conceptual framework to better understand and describe human biological variation from a biocultural perspective.  The outcomes of this workshop will advance biocultural research in anthropology by elaborating this framework, which emphasizes the bidirectional relationships between biology and culture. Over the past twenty-five years biocultural anthropologists have learned much about how social or cultural factors influence biology, but relatively little about how the distribution of biological traits in a population influence social norms.  Using the biological normalcy framework, the two meanings of normal are untangled, revealing the relationships between the two, and the ways that ethno-biocentric views may exist in discourse about human biological variation are exposed. The workshop is structured as a three day intensive session, with each day having a mix of individual presentations, group discussion, and small group research. Participants will focus on the causes and consequences of relationships between statistical norms and normative views, with each providing material on specific biological or biobehavioral traits (such as growth, body proportions, sleep, diet, among others), and investigate the ways that ethno-biocentric views may exist in discourse about these traits and their variability within and across populations. Funds support travel costs for a diverse group of participants in various career stages to and from the School for Advanced Research in Santa Fe, NM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These numbers do not include the industrial water and wastewater systems.  This massive infrastructure is confronting the increased role of water in national security issues, changes in national and regional regulatory compliance requirements, a retiring workforce, new technology, and the changing demands of industry.  Thus, there is a need for realignment of academia, industry, business, and government to ensure the resilience of the U.S. water infrastructure. An important part of the water infrastructure labor force are water and wastewater technicians. Technician jobs are growing faster than average and include water operations technicians, wastewater treatment technicians, and water and wastewater system technicians and operators. These occupations have wages above the national median and, because the jobs are mandated by regulations, they cannot be outsourced. Water technology jobs survive economic downturn cycles because populations will always need clean drinking water and wastewater treatment to survive, and business and industry need clean water to produce goods and services. <br/><br/>The Advanced Technology Environmental Education Center (ATEEC) is an Advanced Technological Education Resource Center that supports and advances high school and community college environmental technology education through curriculum development, professional development, and program improvement. ATEEC will create Professional Learning Community webinars for new water/wastewater technology programs; conduct a national Defining Forum and occupational analyses to define current water technician level jobs; update the interactive Defining Water Management Careers Chart for high school/community college career counselors and students; revise the Brownfields in a Box with updated technology to interest new students in water careers; expand the electronic environmental resource library of juried water technology content; develop augmented/virtual reality modules in water/wastewater content; and assist college programs in crosswalks to increase the number of veterans receiving college credit for military training/experience. Results of ATEEC activities and evaluation will be broadly disseminated.

Americans across diverse communities and all socioeconomic strata report engaging with their smartphones out of habit and in compulsive ways. Though smartphone use in general provides enormous value and quality-of-life enhancements to users, software designs that promote compulsive, habit-forming patterns of engagement leave users feeling frustrated with their own behavior and struggling to make changes. Historically, the scientific literature has examined these phenomena using monolithic constructs like ""problematic Internet use"" and ""smartphone addiction,"" and design research has innovated in this space by creating stand-alone mechanisms that support users in self-policing their use of technology, such as lock-out tools and system-wide timers. This project shifts the design focus to the internal workings of the app itself and redesigns the existing experience to be less-habit forming, rather than attempting to combat its habit-forming nature through monitoring tools.<br/><br/>This research will use YouTube and Twitter, two of the most popular apps among American smartphone users, as testbeds for redesign. The first phase of this project will conduct a series of user-centered design activities with participants who identify as routine users of these popular media to understand what they value in their usage experiences, what they wish they could change, and how their behaviors relate to components of the interface. Using existing third-party application programming interfaces provided by the two platforms, the research will then redesign and implement a new version of the client application software for each technology. Finally, a four-week deployment study with twenty-five users of each technology will compare two weeks of baseline usage against two weeks of usage with the redesigned version of the target app. During both the baseline and intervention periods, log data of usage patterns will be collected (including frequency of use, duration of use, context of use, and engagement with various app features), as well as experience sampling method data probing users' satisfaction with their own behaviors. Exit interviews and a larger survey with participants will be conducted following the deployment to understand their experiences with redesigned YouTube and Twitter clients. At the conclusion of the study, these redesigned apps will be made available to the broader public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In between the two plates, a wedge-shaped piece of the upper mantle experiences extensive physical and chemical transformations. While cooling down, the corner of the mantle wedge is sheared and hydrated by fluids that arise from the dehydrating sinking plate. As rocks become hydrated through a process called serpentinization, the wedge corner becomes weaker and lighter. Serpentinization also causes rock expansion and changes in permeability which in turn affects fluid migration in subduction zones. The resulting fluid distribution and weakening have strong implications for important geological processes, such as great earthquakes and volcanic eruptions in subduction-zone settings. To better constrain the physical properties of the wedge corner, the PI will quantify the spatial extent of serpentinization using numerical modeling. The models will account for geophysical observations collected in subduction zones in North America and Japan and incorporate experimental data on rock deformation and hydration. The project outcomes will further our understanding of subduction-zone dynamics. They will also help interpreting seismic observations and assessing geohazards near plate boundaries. This project will support an early-career female scientist, the training of two graduate students in Earth Science, and educational outreach toward K-12 students and teachers, and the public.<br/><br/>Inferring the extent of serpentinization in the mantle-wedge corner from seismic velocities is challenging because of the strong elastic anisotropy of the mineral antigorite. Antigorite is the main product of serpentinization in the wedge corner. It develops crystal-preferred orientations (CPOs) through deformation and topotactic growth from its parent mineral olivine. This can make the wedge corner highly anisotropic, but antigorite CPOs in this region are not well understood. Fracture permeability in the wedge corner controls the extent of serpentinization. However, the effect of background and reaction-induced stresses on fracture permeability is also unclear. To quantify serpentinization in the wedge corner, the PI will use three distinct classes of numerical models: (1) a time-dependent thermo-mechanical model for mineral texture evolution, (2) a mechanical model for spatial variations in the stress state and (3) a hydraulic-chemical-mechanical model for the development of reaction-induced fractures. The models will account for seismological, geodetic, gravity and magnetic observations in the forearc regions of three subduction zones (Cascadia, Nankai, and NE Japan). The PI will also integrate in the modeling experimental results on the rheology and microstructures of the relevant minerals. Model outcomes will help to constrain CPOs in the mantle wedge corner and the degree of serpentinization.  They will also improve our understanding of background and reaction-induced stresses and their effects on serpentinization. This project has direct implications for our understanding of subduction zone dynamics and broader implications for the assessment of geohazards near plate boundaries. It will support an early-career female scientist, two graduate students and educational outreaches toward K-12 students and teachers, and the public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Beyond computer animation, the result of this research will be used for anatomy training and education by combining musculoskeletal simulations with haptic feedback. This research will also lead to novel applications in diverse other fields, including: medicine, for surgical training and stroke rehabilitation; ergonomics, for better understanding of energy use; bio-paleontology, for discovering the movement of extinct animals; robotics, for bio-inspired tendon-driven actuators; and neuroscience, for reverse engineering the brain by providing a computational testbed for understanding motor control. The integrated educational objective of this project is to use concepts from computer graphics, computer animation, and computational biomechanics as motivational tools to teach people of diverse ages and backgrounds about STEM careers.<br/><br/>This research will build on existing musculoskeletal simulations in biomechanics and graphics. In recent decades, two contrasting methods for musculoskeletal simulation have been developed: line-based methods and volume-based methods. Unfortunately, there is currently no way to get the best of both worlds because these methods are built on fundamentally different principles; line-based methods are built on rigid body dynamics, whereas volume-based methods are built on continuum mechanics. This project will bridge the gap between these two approaches. The specific research objectives are threefold. (1) To imbue the standard line-based methods with two important features, muscle inertia and branching. The guiding principle for this research objective is to expand the current capabilities of existing line-based methods while enabling easy integration into off-the-shelf simulators. (2) To apply intelligent model reduction that is specific to muscles, in order to make the volume-based methods more efficient and robust, and capable of gracefully degrading to line-based methods. (3) To validate the proposed computational models rigorously with real-world anatomical data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of those are designed to model physical or biological processes with numerous components, such as bacterial growth, combustion fronts, very cold gases at the atomic level, and so on. Predicting the behavior of such a system at large times is very challenging, and for mathematical analysis one needs to rely on certain special structure of the model at hand. This structure originates in algebra and representation theory, and it ultimately allows one to access large time and scale characteristics at a very fine resolution. The resulting probabilistic laws tend to be occurring in a substantially wider range of probabilistic systems, which can be observed through numerical and physical experiments. <br/><br/>This project is about stochastic systems that can be analyzed by essentially algebraic methods; such systems are often call exactly solvable or integrable. The overarching goal is to develop a theory of stochastic vertex models related to  quantum affine groups of arbitrary ranks.  On one hand, this class of models is very general, uniting many previously studied integrable probabilistic models (such as ASEP, directed polymers in random environment, and quantum Boson systems), as well as adding many new ones (such as multi-species or colored exclusion processes).

Ramsey's Theorem states that given any coloring of all pairs of natural numbers into finitely many colors, there is an infinite subset in which all pairs have the same color.  Since its inception, Ramsey theory has developed in multiple directions, often appearing as the core content in solutions to deep problems from a wide range of mathematical disciplines.  This project utilizes techniques in mathematical logic to more fully develop Ramsey theory of infinite relational structures.  A major motivation is to find dividing lines between those infinite structures which act like the natural numbers in the sense of possessing analogues of Ramsey's theorem, and those which do not.  Of particular interest is the advancement of Ramsey theory for structures with forbidden configurations.  Progress on infinite structures works in tandem with progress in mathematical logic and topology, creating new pathways between several areas of mathematics.  This project includes some important questions which are suitable for graduate students and early career researchers, thus providing opportunities to broaden participation of well-trained mathematicians via the PI's mentoring.<br/><br/>This research program will develop the Ramsey theory of infinite relational structures, especially those with forbidden configurations, an area which had been largely impervious to investigations prior to the PI's recent solution for the universal homogeneous triangle-free graph.  This will involve constructing new types of trees which code homogeneous relational structures and using the technique of forcing to produce (in ZFC) Ramsey theorems for these classes of trees.  These new techniques will be used obtain better bounds for finite structural Ramsey theory.  Computability theoretic strengths of varying Ramsey statements, and connections with classification schemes in model theory will be investigated.

This project combines 20 years of research in two areas: how genetic material is expressed to build organisms and how mutational changes in DNA sequence lead to changes in specific traits over time. The project combines data from experimental yeast populations measuring the effects of new mutations on gene expression with theory in evolutionary and quantitative genetics. The synthesis of this work will provide a more complete understanding of how differences in gene expression arise and persist over evolutionary time. This synthesis will be presented in a scholarly review paper expected to have a major influence on the field. It will also form the basis of a computational model that will enable new areas of interdisciplinary work. Finally, the importance of mutation as the origin of differences within and between species will be presented to the general public in an interactive museum exhibit developed in collaboration with the University of Michigan's Natural History Museum. Ultimately, this research provides insight into the general rules of life regarding how regulatory variation arises and persists, with potential insights into diverse problems in agriculture, medicine and other areas of societal interest. <br/><br/>Gene expression is controlled by both cis- and trans-regulatory sequences. Variation in both types contributes to expression differences seen within and between species. As for all traits, this variation in gene expression reflects both the introduction of phenotypic variation by mutation (the ""arrival of the fittest"") as well as filtering of this variation by natural selection (the ""survival of the fittest""). This project will take advantage of data produced by the laboratory's systematic study of properties of new regulatory mutations and comparisons with the properties of regulatory variants found in natural populations. These comparisons reveal both what can happen and what has happened in terms of regulatory evolution. More specifically, the relative frequency, effects, dominance, plasticity, gene-by-environment interactions, pleiotropy, and epistasis of cis- and trans-regulatory mutations affecting expression of a focal gene (the Saccharomyces cerevisiae TDH3 gene) have all been measured empirically. In addition, the fitness effects of changing TDH3 expression have also been determined in multiple environments, and cis- and trans-regulatory variation among strains of S. cerevisiae recently isolated from the wild have been characterized. Synthesizing these data and integrating them with evolutionary theory will result in a more complete picture of the evolutionary process than available for any other quantitative trait.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many fish have fin rays that branch one or more times, and the presence, number and position of these branches are highly variant between species. Understanding the developmental processes that determine branch position can lead to a better understanding of how evolution has shaped fin diversity. This research program aims to use the fin ray skeleton to reveal fundamental mechanisms that allow bones to establish, remember and re-create their shapes. Further, since the functional significance of fin structure is incompletely understood, this research is integrated with an undergraduate training program that will address outstanding questions about the diversity, performance and evolution of fin ray structures and branching patterns. This course will reciprocally inform and enrich the overall research effort, and will mentor students from diverse backgrounds in answering research questions of their own design. This integrated research program is anticipated to provide a better understanding of fish fin development and adaptation; will yield insights into skeleton and limb development in other organisms, including humans, with likely relevance to regenerative medicine; and will help to prepare scientists at multiple educational levels for independent careers in science.<br/><br/>This research uses zebrafish caudal fin rays to test a model by which proximo-distal positional identity is coordinated with fin outgrowth to specify ray morphology during both development and regeneration.

Leveraging an investigation-based undergraduate research training course, this integrated program will further address related questions about the functional biomechanics and evolution of fin and fin ray morphology in actinopterigians.

This award provides methods for pricing, hedging, stability and asymptotic analysis in financial markets. These projects will further our understanding of so-called incomplete markets (i.e., the markets which have a limited capability to offset risks) and the sensitivity of such markets to different types of perturbations and trading restrictions. The topics will lead to new developments in stochastic control, convex and stochastic analysis, to novel interdisciplinary research, and results applicable in the financial industry. Graduate students and post doctoral researchers are included in the work of the project.<br/><br/>The first research topic is stability and asymptotic analysis of financial markets with respect to perturbations. Mathematically this topic leads to investigations of the responses of the underlying stochastic control problems to distortions of the input data. An appropriate form of parametrization for the perturbations and the corresponding value functions will allow for analysis involving only partial convexity (in one variable) of the underlying value function. Both dynamic and static formulations of the underlying stochastic control problem will be considered. The second topic is the pricing and hedging of financial instruments when additional trading constraints are imposed. This topic is connected to an investigation of the optimal investment problem with labor income, where extra trading constraints make the problem hard to analyze, and special forms of parametrization of the labor income and the value function are needed. The mathematical work relies on classical and modern results in stochastic analysis, stochastic control, finite and infinite-dimensional convex analysis, and new results to be established by the Principal Investigator.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The Langlands program is a web of far-reaching and influential conjectures that predicts surprising connections between arithmetic (e.g., properties of integer solutions to polynomial equations) and analysis (e.g., automorphic forms, which are highly symmetric solutions to certain differential equations on symmetric manifolds). The celebrated proof of Fermat's Last Theorem by A. Wiles, for instance, uses early results in the Langlands program proved by Langlands and Tunnell. In another direction, automorphic forms have deep connections with the string theory and the study of black holes in physics. In this project the PI will investigate analytic properties of automorphic forms and their number-theoretic consequences in the Langlands program. The project also integrates educational opportunities, including public outreach lectures, undergraduate and graduate research activities, cross-disciplinary training and research, and graduate curriculum development. <br/><br/>A main theme in the theory of automorphic forms is to study the discrete spectrum of a connected reductive algebraic group defined over a number field. By the pioneering work of Arthur, followed by many others, the discrete spectrum of a classical group has been classified into so-called Arthur packets, which are parametrized by Arthur parameters. The first part of this project is to analyze the finer structure of Arthur packets, including: concrete constructions of modules in each Arthur packet; Fourier coefficients of automorphic representations in each Arthur packet, including Jiang's conjecture; cuspidality of each Arthur packet; and relations among Arthur packets of different but closely related groups (via automorphic descent). The PI will also work on establishing Langlands functorial descent for exceptional groups, towards studying the Langlands functoriality and the discrete spectra of exceptional groups. The second part of the project is about converse problems. Converse problems aim to recover modular/automorphic forms from their Fourier coefficients. For example, the famous converse theorems of Hecke and Weil give sufficient conditions for a Dirichlet series to be the Mellin transform of a modular form. It is known that converse theorems play an important role in the establishment of Langlands functoriality. In this part of the project the PI will develop approaches to several conjectures, including Jacquet's conjecture and Cogdell-Piatetski-Shapiro conjecture, in order to prove optimal local and global converse theorems, as well as converse problems for exceptional groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The purpose of this project is to improve the mathematical and scientific understanding of those equations via (i) concrete research projects aimed at studying the long-time behavior of solutions to such equations, and (ii) an educational component aimed at introducing such problems to a new and diverse generation of mathematicians. A primary focus of the principal investigator will be the analysis of the two-dimensional water wave equations, which govern the evolution of a free fluid surface, or of the interface between two fluids. The goal is to provide a better description of both the local dynamics (e.g. low regularity solutions and formation of singularities) and of global dynamics in fluid flows. Here, by singularities in free boundary problems, the principal investigator means evolutions where the interface loses smoothness, possibly forming a corner-like singularity followed by ""wave breaking''.  Such a behavior is exhibited in many physically important phenomena, like turbulence in ocean waves, tsunami formation, just to mention a few. While this wave breaking is easy to observe and has very strong manifestations in nature, its scientific understanding is rather poor, and the mathematical justification of the phenomena based on the constitutive equations is rather difficult and is fully open at this time. This project aims to tackle a selection of key open problems related to singularity formation and to long-time properties of solutions to several classes of dispersive and hyperbolic equations that arise from a physical or geometric context, largely motivated by fluid dynamics. The project includes an educational component aimed at raising the interest of a younger generation of researchers in those fundamental problems through workshops, seminars, REU projects, etc.<br/><br/>One of the main goals of the project is to understand the long-time behavior of solutions of the water waves. This includes lifespan estimates as well as global in time dynamics and scattering properties, where possible.  From this perspective there are two key properties that play a role: one is the ""dispersive decay'', and the other is the ``resonance analysis''.  Some of the key tools developed by the PI and collaborators (the ""quasilinear modified energy method'', and the ""testing with wave packets method'') will contribute to a better understanding of the proposed problems, but nevertheless, improvements of the existing methods and the need to develop new and robust techniques remain essential in order to describe, for instance, the singularity formation mechanism. The quasilinear nature of these equations plays a crucial role in the difficulty associated with the analysis of the long- time behavior and properties of the solutions. Water waves and related models are effective equations for the ocean dynamics that are derived in the physics literature from heuristic considerations and have very important implications on the long-time behavior of dispersive partial differential equations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They appear in a wide variety of applications ranging from food and cosmetic products, to agricultural uses, to pharmaceuticals and biomedical devices, and also are relevant to water sustainability.  Nearly all research on ""loaded gels"" thus far has concentrated on water-based materials since water is abundant, versatile, and biocompatible.  However, loaded gels comprised of hydrocarbon solvent (e.g., mineral oil), instead of water, offer many benefits including greatly improved shelf life and elimination of complicated water-polymer and water-nanocarrier interactions. This RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) project will deliver an approach to fabricate hydrocarbon-based gels loaded with nanocarriers. Then, principles correlating gel formulation quantities with resultant nanoscale structure and subsequently nanoscale structure with release rate of the nanocarriers and gel physical characteristics (e.g., flexibility and strength) will be established. These results will provide a fundamental understanding of the isolated effects of loaded gel nanostructure on practical properties. Furthermore, the findings will contribute to future developments of loaded gel materials in the health, agricultural, water-sustainability, and related industries. Of equal importance to its technical contributions, this work will be partially conducted by undergraduate STEM students, thereby cultivating their scientific/technical expertise and interests.  The students will also be exposed to cutting-edge instrumentation and research at national laboratories.  The principal investigator, along with support from these aspiring engineers/scientists, will apply acquired knowledge in undergraduate teaching and middle/high school outreach activities.<br/><br/><br/>Part 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Polymer gels extend the usefulness of macromolecules, including their ability to be loaded with nanocarrier species such as micelles, vesicles, and nanoparticles. Nanocarrier-loaded polymer gels exhibit superior properties over their stand-alone constituents (i.e., payload-containing gels and nanocarriers dispersed in liquids), which is particularly beneficial in applications where high payload storage and slow, steady release are desired, such as in agricultural and pharmaceutical delivery devices. This RUI award supports investigation of loaded block copolymer organogels (referred to as dual domain organogels (DDOGs) or their block copolymer and nanocarrier domains) wherein the solvent and block copolymer are nonpolar hydrocarbons and the nanocarriers are reverse micelles. This makeup eliminates the complex, long-range interactions, such as electrostatic and dipole-dipole forces, present in hydrogels as well as eradicates dependence on a single solvent and greatly extends shelf-life. Objectives of the work include: (i) synthesis of formulation-structure design rules for DDOGs such that a number of their nanoscale features can be methodically tailored, and (ii) establishment of structure-property relationships for reverse micelle diffusion and mechanical behavior in the tailored organogels.  The results from this work will not only advance the scientific communities' understanding of loaded gel formulation and properties, but may also inform use of these materials in a number of high-impact technologies including sensors, water purification, ion-exchange processes (e.g., batteries), agriculture, and health.  Of equal importance, the work will cultivate the careers of undergraduate STEM students including exceptional experiences to operate cutting-edge instrumentation at national laboratories, interpret resultant data, and present their findings. The principal investigator, along with support from these aspiring engineers/scientists, will extend acquired knowledge to inform undergraduate teaching and middle/high school outreach activities.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is motivated by the challenges in data and predictive analytics and in control for participatory science data collection and curation in cyber-physical systems (CPS) experiments.<br/><br/>This project focuses on data-driven frameworks to address these challenges in CPS-enabled participatory science that builds on statistics, optimization, control, natural language processing, CPS fundamentals, and coordination of participants, known as crowd steering. This framework, known as DCCDI for Data-driven Crowdsensing CPS Design and Implementation, tightly combines the underlying methods and techniques, especially focusing on physical sensors, mobility, and model-based approaches, to improve efficiency, effectiveness, and accountability.  Validation of the DCCDI framework is conducted through simulations, case studies, and on real-world CPS-enabled experiments. This project closely integrates education and training with foundational research and public outreach that enhances interdisciplinary thinking about CPS systems, engages the public through participatory science, and broadens participation in science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and computer science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The number of people interested in learning computer programming has increased dramatically in recent years. However, a particularly challenging barrier that novice programmers face is they often hold misconceptions about how their code behaves. A key reason that novices have this issue is they often have a different definition of program correctness than professional programmers. Although current tools provide helpful feedback in fixing syntax errors, novice programmers often have considerable difficulty with semantic errors, which occur when the program compiles but behaves differently than the programmer expected. This research will investigate tool designs that identify novice programmers' misconceptions, correct the misconceptions, and prevent future misconceptions. Taking a user-centered design approach, the researcher will share findings from a series of comparative user studies and a field deployment that measure the effectiveness of the tool designs. The availability of such tools could lower the barriers that novice programmers face and improve accessibility to learn how to program.<br/><br/>In particular, this project will develop novel tool designs that accomplish three mutually supportive goals: (1) identify misconceptions that novice programmers have about their program's behavior by leveraging program analysis techniques and predictive models, (2) correct novice programmers' misconceptions and explain the rationale without disrupting the programmers, and (3) prevent future misconceptions by generating test code for the novice programmers that will catch unintended changes to the program's behavior. The tools will be implemented as extensions to code editors, and will be made open source and publicly available for the public to use. Additionally, the project will contribute teaching materials to aid instructors in integrating the tools into programming courses, and maintain a publicly available database of key data that were obtained during the investigations. Overall, this project strives to make considerable impact by helping a diverse population of novice programmers to better understand their code while learning how to program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The equations studied have deep connections with a host of other areas of mathematics, including the calculus of variations, differential games, dynamical systems, geometry, homogenization theory, and inverse problems. The main goal of the project is to discover new underlying principles and general methods to understand the properties of solutions of the PDEs under investigation. A key object of the research is a crystal growth model, in which the crystal grows in both horizontal direction by adatoms, and in vertical direction by nucleation in a supersaturated media. To make practical use of the model, it is extremely important to understand deeply the qualitative and quantitative aspects of the growth speed of the crystal. An integral part of the project is the educational component including bringing up the number of graduate PDE students at University of Wisconsin-Madison through various activities. The incoming graduate students interested in PDE are encouraged to participate in the principal investigator's PDE reading seminar, and to interact more with their peers and postdocs in the area. In term of undergraduate training, the principal investigator plans to increase the interest of University of Wisconsin-Madison undergraduate mathematics majors in the study of Analysis and PDE through some individual mentoring plans, and two undergraduate summer schools. Besides, the principal investigator plans to organize two conferences in nonlinear PDE and related topics for early career researchers.<br/><br/>The proposed research involves two themes. The first is about a level-set mean curvature equation with driving and source terms, and applications to a crystal growth model, in which each level set of the unknown evolves in time by its mean curvature with unit constant force. The second involves Eikonal equations, and homogenization, where the zero-level set of the unknown moves in a periodic environment with highly oscillatory normal velocity. The principal investigator and his collaborators have recently developed some new approaches, which provided solutions to several open problems in these two themes and related areas. The new approaches are expected to be developed further in this project, thereby bringing fresh perspectives on and insights into the field of nonlinear PDE and viscosity solutions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Successfully navigating the environment requires the brain to be capable of learning and remembering specific features of the environment. In mammals, males tend to have better spatial memory, and for decades, scientists have explained this as a necessity for males to navigate over larger areas in search of mates. However, this hypothesis has never been directly tested, and other researchers have recently suggested that male superiority in spatial abilities might be a side-effect of testosterone. Rainforest frogs will be used to test between these alternative hypotheses. In contrast to mammals, frogs have both the species where males roam larger rainforest areas and species where females have larger home ranges than males. Potential sex differences in navigational ability will be measured across a range of species in the field by tracking their ability to return home after displacements. Then, standardized behavioral assays will be used in the lab to detect any sex differences across various species and identify the brain regions used for spatial memory. Finally, the neuroanatomy of the amphibian hippocampus will be investigated to determine if frogs use similar or different brain mechanisms for navigation compared to mammals. Comparing these mechanisms will shed light on the evolution of spatial capabilities in animals, including humans. These research activities will be integrated into education by collaborating with Stanford undergraduates and Canada Community College students to perform behavior experiments.<br/><br/>The ability to navigate the environment is essential for survival and reproductive success. Sex differences in spatial abilities have been documented in many taxa. In mammals, males often outperform females and this superiority in spatial ability has been attributed to sex differences in life history strategies where polygamous males maintain larger home ranges. Recent challenges to this theory suggest that improved spatial ability is a byproduct of high testosterone in males rather than an adaptation to different life history strategies. The authors will directly test these alternative hypotheses using an amphibian clade with contrasting life histories and spatial strategies of males and females through three aims: 1) Examine sex differences in navigational ability by tracking translocated frogs in the wild in three species with sex differences in home range size. 2) Test for species variation and the role of androgens in spatial memory. Additional experiments will test the influence of androgens on task performance and link performance differences to patterns of neural activity. 3) Define the neuroanatomy of the amphibian medial pallium (homolog of the mammalian hippocampus) using single nuclei sequencing, sequencing active neurons, and tract tracing to examine potential sex and species differences in pallial connectivity. Together, this work will contrast and test life-history adaptation and testosterone spill-over hypotheses using ecologically-relevant behavioral assays in the wild, controlled behavioral assays in the laboratory, and neuroanatomical studies. This research will be integrated into education with courses and internship opportunities developed for undergraduate students at Stanford University and Canada Community College.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such reactions commonly proceed by cleaving the carbon-carbon bonds of the molecules in a process that requires dioxygen (O2) from the atmosphere.  The mechanism by which biological iron sites facilitate these O2-dependent reactions is not fully understood, which hinders the design of man-made molecules capable of using O2 as a cheap and environmentally-friendly oxidant.  In this project, Dr. Adam Fiedler is generating a series of model systems, ranging from small complexes to supramolecular assemblies, to obtain molecular-level insights into the O2 reactivity of iron in both biological and man-made contexts.  A powerful combination of spectroscopic and computational tools is utilized to characterize unstable and transient species that have been proposed (but rarely observed) in Nature.  In this way, the project provides a more complete picture of reactions that are essential for the remediation of polluted soils and groundwaters.  The interdisciplinary nature of the project offers a valuable training experience in both experimental and theoretical methods for graduate and undergraduate students.  Dr. Adam Fiedler collaborates with local teachers to engage high-school students in activities that combine chemistry with artistic expression.  This outreach program exposes students to concepts and instrumentation used in the project, thereby increasing scientific literacy and the chances that students pursue college degrees in science. <br/><br/>With funding from the CSDM-B Program of the Chemistry Division, Dr. Adam Fiedler of Marquette University is developing synthetic iron-containing complexes that mimic key features of nonheme iron dioxygenases.  Dioxygenases that cleave carbon-carbon bonds are critical for the microbial degradation and assimilation of organic compounds that arise from both natural and human sources.  However, the O2 activation mechanisms employed by these enzymes are not fully understood. In particular, there is uncertainty regarding the geometric and electronic factors that govern the reactivity of pivotal intermediates featuring superoxo, peroxo, and/or substrate radical ligands.  This project combines coordination chemistry, reaction kinetics, spectroscopic techniques, and computational methods to illuminate the complex relationships between structure and reactivity in bio-inspired iron complexes, including transient intermediates of catalytic significance.  In addition, new approaches for incorporating well-defined second- and third-sphere ligand architectures are developed.  These efforts provide fundamental knowledge regarding O2 activation processes in a variety of metalloenzymes and aid in the design of new oxidation catalysts.  The methods used in this research offer interdisciplinary training for undergraduate and graduate-level scientists.  Dr. Adam Fiedler is also engaged in outreach activities directed towards high-school students that stimulate interest in science by emphasizing the visually appealing aspects of inorganic chemistry and crystallography.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Combinatorics studies various discrete structures (such as permutations, partially ordered sets, and graphs), which are well suited for encoding complex mathematical objects and for the related computations. Representation theory is a fundamental tool for studying symmetry, by realizing the elements of abstract groups/algebras as linear transformations (of some vector spaces). The PI studies representations of Lie algebras and quantum groups, which have many applications to physics, such as calculating the probability of a particle system being in a given state at a particular time. In geometry, the PI focuses on Schubert calculus, which has its origins in enumerative geometry (e.g., counting the lines or planes satisfying a number of generic intersection conditions), but is currently related to modern areas such as quantum cohomology. Some of the models developed by the PI have been or will be implemented in the open source computer algebra system SAGE.<br/><br/>The proposed research consists of the following main projects, to be pursued with several collaborators. (1) The PI will extend his work on uniform combinatorial models for Kirillov-Reshetikhin (KR) crystals of affine Lie algebras from the single column KR crystals to the arbitrary ones. (2) Uniform combinatorial formulas are sought for the (non-metaplectic and metaplectic) Iwahori Whittaker functions, which are a basic tool in the theory of automorphic forms. Connections with Schubert calculus will also be investigated. (3) The combinatorics of the geometric Satake correspondence (realizing geometrically the irreducible representations of reductive groups) is studied via a combinatorial decomposition of Lusztig's q-analogue of the Weyl character. (4) In Schubert calculus, the PI has several projects related to various cohomologies of generalized flag varieties. In particular, an extension of Schubert calculus beyond K-theory is pursued based on the so-called Kazhdan-Lusztig Schubert classes in hyperbolic cohomology (which gives a stalk version of the elliptic cohomology of Ginzburg-Kapranov-Vasserot); these classes were defined by the PI in previous joint work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dynamical systems are mathematical objects which evolve in time, and they are ubiquitous in the applications of mathematics.  Whenever math is used to predict the future, e.g. to predict the weather, the stock market, or the behavior of particles in a solution, a dynamical system is involved.  The dynamical systems in the real world, like those just mentioned, are often extraordinarily complex.  The PI will study a simple class of dynamical systems modeled on ideal billiards in polygons with a view towards understanding the complicated dynamical systems that occur in applications.  The PI will work to uncover and categorize the range of dynamical behaviors possible in billiard systems, and will continue his research exploring connections between billiards and the theory of numbers.  Using the resources allotted by this grant, the PI will also create a graduate course on topics relevant to his research.  The course will culminate in a workshop hosted at Rice University during which leaders in the field have a chance to interact with students in the class.  Finally, the PI will use funding from this grant to create a curriculum in mathematical biology for the Say STEM Camp, a camp aimed at engaging high school students in groups typically underrepresented in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project seeks to address fundamental challenges in the study of dynamics on Riemann surfaces and their moduli spaces. These subjects have connections with many areas of mathematics and important applications to the classification of mapping classes, the dynamics of rational maps and billiards in polygons. Of particular importance are the special subvarieties of moduli space which are invariant under the geodesic flow.  Such subvarieties are rare and their origins are mysterious.  The PI will pursue two lines of research in this proposal.

It studies the long run behavior of a system subject to laws of motion. The study of rigidity phenomenon is one of the central themes in dynamical systems, with applications to number theory, geometry, and mathematical physics. Roughly speaking, an action is rigid if various properties of the system are preserved under appropriate modifications. So far, systems with strong chaotic properties have been well understood. In many systems of interest however, only weak chaotic behaviors can be observed. The goal of this project is to develop new tools to study such systems and then apply these results to study other areas of mathematics, such as number theory and representation theory. The research plan is complemented by educational and outreach activities involving the training of undergraduates, graduate students, and postdoctoral associates, and fostering collaborations among female researchers in different areas.<br/><br/>The proposed research plan consists of several coherent projects, ranging from dynamical systems, harmonic analysis for Lie groups, representation theory and number theory. The principal investigator plans to establish cocycle rigidity and to study (twisted) cohomological equations for a large class of algebraic partially hyperbolic and parabolic actions by using representation theory. The results and techniques from the study of parabolic actions will be applied to number theory for the study of effective equidistribution for certain unipotent flows and maps on some homogenous spaces of semidirect product groups. The principle investigator will also combine KAM approach and representation theory to general partially hyperbolic and parabolic algebraic actions to study local rigidity. A large class of new examples whose geometric properties are distinctly different from existing examples will be explored.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For firefighters, the greatest challenges in search and rescue tasks are low visibility, disorientation, and tracking other team members. Despite methods to overcome these challenges, firefighters are still plagued by getting lost in buildings, miscommunication of locations and spaces, and not being able to identify paths. This project investigates using spatial (or 3D) sound to represent targets of interest (for example, a lost child) in order to allow first responders to use sound to navigate to specific points that they are unable to see. Using 3D sound in this context is a promising solution because responders' hands are often occupied, and a visual display can increase cognitive load. In addition, the present work will develop supplemental augmented-reality modules for firefighter emergency medical service (EMS) training. This training will allow firefighters to practice EMS skills in a realistic environment outside of the classroom. The PI and team will engage a diverse pool of underrepresented minority students through recruitment from the Distributed Research Experiences for Undergraduates (DREU) program and the Institute for African American Mentoring in Computing Sciences (iAAMCS). University of Florida (UF) undergraduate students will also be recruited through the Emerging Scholars Program to participate in the proposed work. Furthermore, firefighters will receive more interactive educational training as a direct result of their collaboration in this research program.<br/><br/>This research will pursue a novel research program to create a fundamental understanding of how to move 3D audio research out of the laboratory into the real world. Working closely with Gainesville Fire Rescue (GFR) as the testbed application domain, the project team will evaluate using 3D audio to support a search and rescue mission. The PI and team will evaluate firefighters' performance and use the results to inform data-driven and empirically validated 3D sound design guidelines that address the following challenges: Realistic 3D sound rendering - this is challenging due to the individualistic nature of 3D sound filters, sound delivery hardware, and perceptual qualities of sounds; Change detection - in real-world contexts, a user must be able to quickly detect 3D sound changes, however, limited literature exists in this area; Effects of competing sounds - real-world scenarios are filled with background noise that may hinder the listener from accurately distinguishing a 3D sound of interest.

The project intends to recruit academically successful mathematics and science majors in their senior year of college, as well as post-baccalaureate STEM professionals, to complete a teacher credential program.  These preservice teachers will receive mentoring and other supports to enable them to become highly effective teachers in high-need, urban middle and high schools.  The project plans to produce approximately 50 highly-qualified new teachers with STEM degrees over five years.  The project will use a cohort approach for the teacher candidates, which resulted in a 96-97% success rate in a previous NSF-supported mathematics and science credential program.  Noyce Scholars with computer science coursework will be able to add a Computer Science Authorization to their credential and thus be certified to teach Computer Science.<br/><br/>In this project, the College of Education and Allied Studies and the College of Science at California State University, East Bay (CSUEB) are collaborating with the Alameda County Office of Education, Contra Costa County Office of Education, and Hayward, San Lorenzo, and West Contra Costa school districts.  The project intends to: a) increase the number and ethnic and socio-economic diversity of STEM majors who enter the teaching profession; b) strengthen the preparation, professional development, and mentoring that these teachers receive, especially to support teaching in diverse schools; and c) provide a network of interpersonal and professional support that sustains their commitment to a teaching career.  The RT Fisher Educational Enterprises will assist the project in implementing culturally/linguistically relevant and responsive professional development programming.  With the availability of Noyce scholarships and the work of the newly formed Teacher Recruitment Task Force at CSUEB, this project aims to increase the number of mathematics and science teacher credentials earned at the University by 10% each year of the project.  Regarding post-baccalaureate STEM professionals, the project intends to use a creative recruitment strategy that includes a partnership with EnCorps STEM Teachers Program.  This non-profit organization focuses on recruiting existing industry professionals into teaching and guides them through the career change process.  Recruitment strategies for undergraduate STEM majors at the University will involve STEM department chairs, several STEM- or teacher-focused campus affiliates, and outreach to local community colleges.  Dissemination of project strategies, outcomes, and findings through presentations at conferences and publications have the potential to inform local, statewide, and national efforts to recruit, support, and retain increased numbers of STEM teachers who are equipped to provide successful learning experiences in mathematics and science to students in high-need school districts.  The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Better modeling of the effect of the terrain on wind loads can improve the wind resistance of buildings.  Researchers and engineers generally have relied on qualitative terms to describe the terrain, leading to subjective interpretation and inaccurate modeling of the terrain effect. The modeling of the terrain has been especially challenging when the terrain is non-homogeneous, such as a mix of suburban buildings, trees, and roads. In this research, wind tunnel testing will be conducted for different types of heterogeneous terrains. Analytical and computational tools will be developed to characterize the observed terrain effect. To obtain realistic terrain configurations, a database of actual terrains will be developed using terrain images and corresponding land usage classifications. The outcomes of this research will include measurements of wind loading on buildings with various heterogeneous terrain configurations; a database of terrain images, land usage classification within each image, and corresponding heterogeneous terrain roughness; a deep-learning neural network to recognize terrain features in satellite or aerial images; and models to estimate the effect of heterogeneous terrain on wind loading.  These outcomes will contribute to national welfare and prosperity by enhancing research and education in hurricane loss estimation, performance-based wind design, and wind energy assessment, as terrain effect is an important issue in these research areas.  Data from this project will be made publicly available in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot at https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org/.  <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to gain new knowledge on how heterogeneous terrains affect wind loads on buildings. The research will use the NHERI Boundary Layer Wind Tunnel at the University of Florida, which can simulate heterogeneous terrain roughness in an automated way.  Wind tunnel testing will be conducted for three different types of heterogeneous terrains: roughness transitions, small openings, and actual heterogeneous terrains.  The wind speed profile will be measured for all test cases.  Wind loading will be measured for one low-rise building and one mid-rise building. Analytical and computational models will be developed to explain the observed terrain effect. To construct heterogeneous terrain configurations for wind tunnel testing, this research will create a database of actual terrains composed of terrain images and corresponding land usage classifications. A deep-learning neural network will be utilized to improve the existing land usage classifications, particularly for enhancing roughness estimation of developed areas. After constructing the database, clustering algorithms will be used to remove redundancy in the data. Therefore, terrain configurations for wind tunnel testing can be systematically constructed, and represent various possible terrains without overlap.  This research will also address the following: (1) The effect of the upwind terrain will be compared between low-rise buildings and mid-rise buildings; (2) It is often assumed that small openings (such as a small parking lot) can be ignored in surface roughness estimation, but this has not been proven experimentally.  This research will investigate the opening effect for various terrain types; (3) This project will quantify uncertainties in wind loading when an equivalent homogeneous terrain is assumed for a heterogeneous terrain. This knowledge will help in understanding the effect of simplifications in building codes and standards; and (4) This project will formulate analytical and computational models that can explain the observed experimental data. These models will be useful in describing the effect of terrain not included in the experiment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Substantial data show how this coordination is established in vertebrates. However, some of the most basic questions concerning how eye components are coordinated in invertebrates remain unanswered. This project primarily focuses on Sunburst Diving Beetles as a particularly valuable system for analyzing these key factors because they can be manipulated on the molecular level and their larvae have extremely sophisticated eyes, the focus of which can be quantified. To test for the generality of the identified mechanisms, and in specific instances dissect them further, synergistic experiments are performed on the genetically powerful fly model Drosophila melanogaster. The eyes of both animals are evaluated using a micro-ophthalmoscope that has recently been developed in the host laboratory. Preliminary findings suggest that both beetle and fly eyes are able to develop astonishingly precise focus in the absence of visual feedback. If confirmed, invertebrate eyes could become an important general model for precisely tuned organ development that is easily assessable and can be manipulated at the molecular-genetic level. The execution of this project involves training of many undergraduate and graduate students, who will also actively participate in outreach activities. In addition, the project involves the development of synergistic teaching modules.<br/><br/>The principal eyes of diving beetle larvae are sophisticated visual organs that rapidly grow to ~130% of their original size at the second to third instar transition. It is likely that such eye elongation involves changes in osmotic pressure. The lens also needs to be reformed, which takes considerably longer (~8 h) and likely involves some of the 10 lens proteins that have been identified through a previous collaboration of the PI and Co-PI. Aim 1 of the project uses a unique live imaging technique (the micro-ophthalmoscope) that allows direct visualization of the retina and measurement of the refractive states (focusing into infinity or being near- or far-sighted) of very small invertebrate eyes, including those of the diving beetle larvae and individual D. melanogaster ommatidia. This technique is used in combination with traditional optical methods and behavioral tests in diving beetles to test if visual input is necessary for proper eye growth in these animals. Aim 2 uses physical manipulations and pharmacology to evaluate the contribution of osmotic pressure to eye-tube growth and aim 3 uses in situ hybridization, immunostaining, and RNAi knockdowns of the identified lens proteins to investigate how the complex Thermonectus lenses change focal lengths. Targeted parallel experiments on D. melanogaster explore the generality of specific findings. It is expected that this integrative approach will provide some of the first data to address the long overdue question of how eye growth is coordinated in arthropods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polymer materials (plastics) impact society in everyday products that facilitate safety, health and welfare, and also beauty, pleasure and convenience.  Although some plastic materials are meant to be durable and possess long-term stability (e.g. tires, plastic parts for automobiles, helmets, etc.), the full polymer life cycle should be considered during the initial design stages, to incorporate mechanisms for recyclability once the function of the material has been completed.  The negative environmental effects of plastic accumulation and persistence are becoming of increasing importance.  The expected broad impact of this work will be in the advancement of naturally-derived polymer materials that are designed to possess complexities that allow for them to exhibit unique properties, and have in-built mechanisms for their depolymerization and recycling.  A focus will be upon constructing the materials to behave as super-absorbent and tough hydrogels, and rigorous studies will be conducted to determine the effectiveness of the polymer materials to meet needs associated with global water resource challenges, and technological challenges of reducing friction, biofouling, and ice formation.  Significant outcomes of this work are expected to be an advanced knowledge and awareness by future generations of scientists who will consider the full life cycle of the technologies that they develop.  <br/><br/><br/><br/>PART 2:  TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The overall objective is to conduct fundamental studies that lead to advanced understanding of the composition-structure-topology-morphology effects for dual covalently and non-covalently (supramolecularly) crosslinked polymer materials, with an interest in developing mechanically-robust functional polymers that are derived from natural feedstocks and designed to exhibit hydrogel, anti-fouling, anti-icing, pollutant sequestering and other behaviors for diverse applications that address societal challenges, while also being recyclable to limit adverse environmental impacts of the materials long-term.  Glucose will serve as the primary building block from which topologically-complex slide-ring polymer networks will be constructed, having both covalent and supramolecular interactions to result in dynamic, mechanically-robust hydrogel behaviors, with further extension to polymeric high internal phase emulsion (polyHIPE) materials for superabsorbency and high porosity.  Fundamental studies will be performed to determine the properties of the intact materials, followed by investigation of their intentional depolymerization-based recyclability and long-term hydrolytic degradability.  It is hypothesized that systematic investigation of networks that combine components of covalent linkages, supramolecular host-guest interactions, slide-ring topology and polyHIPE morphology will enhance the fundamental understanding of composition-structure-topology-morphology-properties relationships and lead to advanced materials that are capable of ultra-high water uptake kinetics and capacity, while exhibiting dynamic, responsive physicochemical and mechanical behaviors for broad applications.  Importantly, techniques to build such materials from naturally-sourced feedstocks and with in-built depolymerization and disassembly routes will be developed to advance sustainability and recyclability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biological molecules (biomolecules) like proteins and DNA can contain many atoms (thousands!). This means that their structures and internal motions (bending, twisting, folding) can be very complicated and hard to predict. In order to understand biomolecules, chemists have studied them in dilute solution, in other words, under conditions where they are interacting with surrounding water molecules, but not other large biomolecules. It has recently become evident that findings from these studies in dilute solution may not be representative of biological environments. In real living cells, biomolecules exist and function in crowded environments, often assembled together to form membranes, enzyme complexes, and organelles. What are the actual behaviors of biomolecules in real, crowded conditions? Professor Baiz and his students are using a technique called time-resolved, two-dimensional, infrared spectroscopy (2D IR) to study the structure and motions of molecules in more realistic, crowded environments. In order to help interpret the complicated 2D IR data, Professor Baiz is developing computer models for the crowded systems. Together, the experimental and computational studies are forming connections among molecular structure, environments, and dynamics to rationalize the mechanisms of protein interactions in the cell.  Through this project, Professor Baiz and his students are providing insights into how living systems function at the molecular level.  The research may also lead to new cryoprotectant technologies (cryoprotectants are chemical substances that hinder the formation of detrimental ice crystals in cells when they are frozen). The students engaged in this project are gaining valuable skills and experience in cutting edge laser optics technology as well as in the computer simulation of molecular systems.  The broader impacts of this project aim to increase representation from minority students in the Chemistry graduate program at the University of Texas at Austin through organized visit days for underrepresented students across the southwestern states. These efforts seek to boost diversity among the future science and technology workforce.<br/><br/>This project focuses on mapping the ultrafast hydrogen-bond dynamics of small molecules that mimic the protein backbone in solutions with crowding agents such as polymers and proteins to characterize the effects of crowding and confinement on solvation dynamics. Ultrafast two-dimensional infrared spectroscopy is used to extract frequency-frequency correlation functions, which are directly compared to molecular dynamics simulations. Structure-based infrared maps are used to generate spectra from molecular dynamics trajectories, and thus provide a direct connection between experiments and simulations. Vibrational probes, including thiocyanates, are used to access the solvation environments on the surface of proteins to understand the effect of protein polarity and electrostatics on local hydrogen-bond networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

DeafTEC will transition to an ATE Resource Center that will use and build upon the exemplary materials and network developed as the DeafTEC National Center.<br/><br/>The DeafTEC Resource Center will: (1) leverage partnerships to broaden professional development opportunities on-site and online for high school teachers, community college faculty, and employers to improve access to learning and technician employment for deaf/hh students; (2) expand, enhance, and broadly disseminate DeafTEC's innovative online resources and curricula related to technical education and technician careers for deaf/hh students, including military veteran students with hearing loss; and (3) collaborate with and provide mentoring for prospective PIs and current ATE projects and centers on creating inclusive environments for deaf/hh students, including military veteran students with hearing loss. DeafTEC will broaden participation in STEM technician careers for deaf/hh individuals by providing resources that they and their teachers, counselors, employers, and co-workers can used to support success both in the classroom and on the job. The value of DeafTEC Center's resources on universal design, developmental math, and writing across the STEM curriculum extend beyond the deaf/hh community, with potential benefit to all STEM students who need additional resources and support to succeed.  This project is funded by the NSF Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project includes a collaborative partnership with a Hispanic-serving two-year college (Cuesta College) and two high-need school districts (Lucia Mar Unified School District and Santa Maria Joint Union School District).  The project builds on previous Noyce awards by: 1) establishing a summer program for new teachers; 2) enabling interested undergraduates to participate in program activities before they commit to becoming Noyce Scholars and to pursuing a teaching career; and 3) providing research experiences for Noyce Scholars.   Results of this project will inform colleges and schools about effective approaches for recruiting, preparing, and supporting science teachers in high-need settings.  In addition, incorporation of training about culturally responsive teaching and the collaboration with a Hispanic-serving institution have the potential to broaden participation in STEM.<br/><br/>The project activities build on a foundation of curricular and support strategies developed with previous Noyce awards.  The overarching the goal is to increase access to STEM education and careers, including populations historically underrepresented in STEM fields.  New activities include creation of two professional development units on culturally-responsive teaching for pre-service STEM teachers.  In addition, cross-disciplinary science instruction will be incorporated though implementation of the Ambitious Science Teaching model. This teaching model provides a roadmap for student-centered science teaching in which students create and revise scientific models, and make evidence-based arguments.  This strategy is intended to help students solve authentic, relevant problems that require an interdisciplinary approach, which is a major goal of the Next Generation Science Standards.  Dissemination of project outcomes has the potential to provide new information to teacher education programs, including those working with populations that are underrepresented in STEM majors and careers. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research activities will create opportunities for the trainees through strategic partnerships with both academic and non-academic institutions: UT Southwestern Medical Center, DOE laboratories, and SMU Engineering. A centerpiece of the year-round activities will be a 10-week summer undergraduate research program with participants from both SMU and UTRGV. Each group will begin its program with a 2-week summer school, which will introduce undergraduates, graduate students and postdocs to fundamental concepts and techniques used by one of the research groups.  This activity will provide exciting and substantive research experiences to students of all backgrounds. The Department of Mathematics at SMU is well-positioned to execute both the research and educational goals of this project, building on its core strengths in modeling and scientific computing and its ongoing success in placing graduates in a range of careers, from industry to national laboratories.

The results of the research would provide key information for risk-based design of civil engineering and marine systems such as offshore platforms, wind turbines, and ships. The framework and tools would also benefit fundamental research on other complex systems that generate large amounts of data that must be processed-- ranging from manufacturing processes to disaster planning and response.

The research goals center around a deeper understanding of shapes with uneven curvature. The distance between two points in the plane is given by the length of the segment joining them. The segment can be constructed with a ruler, however finding the distance between two points on an arbitrary geometric shape is much more difficult, partly because such shapes don't come with a ruler! Finding this ""ruler"", i.e., the best possible way to measure distances on geometric shapes, is rooted in deep problems of mathematical physics. In mathematics we measure distances using metrics. When trying to find ideal metrics, one often has to find a smooth function that solves a specific partial differential equation. This is an optimization problem with an action functional whose minimizers are exactly the solutions of the partial differential equation. It is possible to plug in non-smooth functions into the action functional, called potentials, opening the door to what is often referred to as the potential theory of the underlying equation. This project deals with problems in complex geometry where the potentials considered can be given a very specific metric geometry, leading to a much more delicate understanding than usual. In addition to the proposed research, the project will pursue a vertically integrated educational program that includes various forms of public outreach popularizing STEM fields (such as creating educational videos and posting them online), conducting undergraduate summer research and the involvement of graduate students.<br/><br/>The research goals of the project can be split in three parts.  The first part is devoted to the geometric potential theory of the geodesic rays inside the space of Kahler metrics, with a view toward various characterizations for existence of canonical Kahler metrics in complex geometry. With the metric geometry of geodesic rays sufficiently developed, one can look at these conjectures as optimization problems on the space of geodesic rays, with various refinements on the regularity of the rays considered. The second part is devoted to the  geometric potential theory of the space of singularity types, with a view toward complex Monge-Ampere equations with prescribed singularity and variation of multiplier ideal sheaves. The metric space of singularity types is expected to be complete, and it will allow for a study of singular Kahler-Einstein metrics, under variation of the singularity.

In response to a stimulus, these coatings can change uptake of water or drug molecules, thus providing control of surface self-cleaning, drug-releasing or antifouling properties. This project employs temperature as one of the most ubiquitous stimuli for controlling behavior of surface coatings. When deposited at the surface of sutures or prosthetic implants, such coatings could deliver drugs (such as anesthetics or antibiotics) in response to increased body temperature, or they could render surfaces non-adhesive on-demand when deposited on large surfaces of windows or ships. Responsive coatings could also prolong the shelf life of food, preventing its rotting on hot days. The challenge is, however, to create such responsive coatings with maximized response to an increase in temperature. This project will take advantage of the capability of the layer-by-layer (LbL) technique, in which the PI is an expert, to create conformal coatings of controlled thickness on a variety of surfaces, and will explore the effect of  various intricate molecular architectures of assembled molecules (on coating functionality.  Advanced instrumental techniques will be used to take snapshots of how multilayered structures, water content, and polymer-film mechanical properties respond to temperature variations. Importantly, this project will create a fertile training ground for the participating graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students. The PI is currently the academic advisor of the ""Women in Materials Science"" (WIMS) organization, which is strongly involved in many outreach activities, including on-campus tours for school teachers and demonstrations for Girl Scouts and high-school students, as well as visits to local schools with the goal of encouraging and engaging 5-7th graders to pursue careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/><br/>PART II: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The ability to form highly functional surfaces by means of assembly of diverse polymeric components lies at the heart of advanced biomedical, marine and food applications. This research studies layer-by-layer (LbL) assemblies and aims to uncover the main underlying principles of assembly of responsive materials at surfaces, specifically focusing on the role of molecular architecture on film structure and response. The focus will be on the unexplored area of upper critical solution temperature (UCST) star-shaped polymers in solution and within LbL films. UCST-type LbL films enable a highly practical route to modulate surface compliance, control interactions with cells or contaminants, and regulate release of trapped small functional molecules in response to an increase in environmental temperature. The challenge is, however, to balance responsiveness of nanocontainers to temperature (which tends to decrease with an increase in star functionality, i.e. number of arms f), with strength of binding with linear polymers chains within LbL films, in order to maximize film responsiveness and performance as a platform for controlled delivery. This project aims to address this challenge by exploring the mechanism of UCST response of star-shaped polymers through the relationships between molecular parameters of the star (f, as well as number of units in the arm N) and responsiveness of polymer stars and their assemblies. The project involves synthesis of novel UCST star polymers, solution studies of assembly of star polymers with hydrogen-bonding polymer partners using isothermal titration calorimetry, dynamic light scattering, fluorescence correlation and vibrational spectroscopies, as well as application of several orthogonal techniques, such as neutron reflectometry, fluorescence recovery after photobleaching, in situ ellipsometry, and nanoindentation to explore assembly and temperature response of LbL star-containing films. The main outcome of the project will be the development of the knowledge relating molecular parameters of the star polymer to their UCST response in solution, diffusivity within LbL films, and the resultant film structure and response. This knowledge will then be used to rationally construct films with programmable temperature -esponse characteristics. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dynamically changing polymer interfaces are an important class of materials that adapt their properties upon external stimuli according to a preprogrammed scenario. This project aims for the development and study of specially designed polymer interfaces which, in response to stimuli, could attract and repel microscopic objects such as colloids, liquid droplets, particles, vesicles, viruses, or biological cells. Dynamic switching between repulsion and attraction will be adjusted and used for selection, differentiation, and isolation of the particulates. Such dynamic interfaces could be able to extract and remove traces of particles of toxic and hazardous materials, soil particles, oil droplets, bacteria, and viruses from various media such as drinking water, blood, food, and surfaces of commodity and specialty materials and devices. On the other side, such dynamic interfaces would be able to differentiate and extract valuable particulates if they are very diluted in mixtures with other ingredients, for example sediments containing noble and rare metals, some types of human stem cells and other biological samples, and samples of soils in agricultural fields and in space missions. The major challenge being addressed in the project is to understand the complex dynamic mechanisms of the interaction of functional polymer interfaces with various particulates possessing different properties and then to apply the obtained knowledge for proper design of the reconfigurable dynamic interfaces. This project also provides a mechanism to educate a new generation of professionals capable of creative and transformative thinking. Advanced polymer science research is attracting many talented young men and women of different backgrounds and training levels, including high school, undergraduate, graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, who care and feel responsible for the development of a strong and healthy national economy, clean and sustainable environment, and societal prosperity. This project will serve the purpose of developing their skills and experience.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Interactions with polymer interfaces via adsorption-desorption mechanisms are limited by the quasi-irreversible adsorption character of polymers, i.e., approaching the equilibrium is hampered by very slow desorption kinetics due to a high activation free energy of the detachment of all adsorbed segments at once. These properties are revealed as strong and quasi-irreversible adsorption of colloidal particulates, liquid droplets, vesicles, proteins, microbes, etc. on the surface of various materials. Whereas this inherent property of polymeric interfaces is advantageous for adhesive applications, this adhesion hysteresis causes complications for affinity-based discrimination of various particulates in complex mixtures for numerous applications. This project aims to develop a novel mechanism of surface differentiation and selective transport of soft colloids owing to dynamic polymeric surfaces with specially designed functionality, microstructure, and dynamic response. This mechanism will be realized by exploring dynamically oscillating polymer interfaces made of distinctive attractive, adhesive, and repulsive micro-domains of microstructured polymer brushes that undergo temperature-driven phase transitions. The adhesive domains will have covalently bound functional motifs that target complementary motifs on the surface of soft colloids of interest. The 2D-interfaces will be designed with anisotropic patterns of microdomains. The different microdomains will have variable dimensions and surface concentration of the specific motifs. A traveling temperature gradient will be applied to facilitate directed transport of soft colloids. The key challenges of the study consist in developing a fundamental understanding of the dynamic interaction of the microstructured polymer-brush interfaces with the soft colloids having different dimensions, elasticity, and composition of surface functional groups, as well as relaxation times. The attachment-detachment dynamic equilibrium controlled by osmotic pressure of swollen repulsive domains, deformation of soft particles, entropic penalty of stretched adhesive domains, and adhesion energy of complimentary motifs will be analyzed in specially designed experiments using soft lipid or block-copolymer vesicles and compared with results of computer simulations. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, they form recyclable plastic materials critical for sustainability. However, detailed quantitative understanding of how to control macroscopic properties of these novel polymeric materials remains a challenge. The proposed research addresses this challenge by combining a broad range of experimental techniques with development and testing of new theoretical model approaches connecting molecular-scale processes to macroscopic properties. The knowledge developed in this research will be central to the rational design of novel recyclable polymers with unique, self-healing, and stimuli-responsive properties. It will have strong impact on various fields of science and engineering, including materials science, physics, chemistry and biophysics. A significant focus of the project is integration with education through active involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in research. The project also promotes active collaborations with national user facilities and international collaborations. <br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Associating polymers, formed by reversible intermolecular interactions, include a wide spectrum of fundamentally and technologically important materials with better recyclability than traditional polymers. Rational design, synthesis, and fabrication of novel associating polymers require a deep fundamental understanding of how the local reversible interactions and phase separation of the associating groups affect the macroscopic properties of these materials. Despite extensive attention and efforts in the past, detailed quantitative understanding of dynamics in the melts of associating polymers remains limited. This hinders development of novel functional materials with desired properties. The main goal of the planned research is to deepen the fundamental understanding of dynamics in associating polymers on different time and length scales with special focus on the role of associating group aggregates. In this research, the chain and segmental dynamics and the viscoelastic properties of associating polymers will be studied by a combination of rheology, dielectric spectroscopy, differential scanning calorimetry, and light- and neutron scattering spectroscopies. It will be complemented by analysis of structure using small angle X-ray and neutron scattering, and will provide broad-based experimental tests of existing theories. The proposed research will deepen fundamental understanding of microscopic parameters controlling macroscopic properties of associating polymers, especially the role of intrinsic heterogeneities. This will be instrumental for a rational design of materials with unique viscoelastic and self-healing properties, as well as for design of novel functional materials with tunable time programmed and stimuli-responsive properties. From a broader perspective, it might also have strong impact on understanding of many biological materials where reversible bonding and interactions play a critical role.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Misapplication of algorithms has the capacity for great harm and discrimination, notably when applied in sentencing decisions about criminal offenders.  Inspecting and investigating algorithmic biases for their real-world impacts is an extremely novel but increasingly important area. The current literature has mostly focused on philosophical and sociological critiques of algorithms. What is sorely needed is a mathematical and computational investigation that builds on these socio-technical critiques in order to provide contextual and quantitative evidence for actual impact. We need to know how people's biases, assumptions, norms and values play into algorithmic perceptions and applications. More specifically, governments often seek to apply algorithms to crime analysis with the usually stated justification of financial efficiencies, reducing human error and smoothening bureaucracies. Therefore, this research seeks to understand the practical, financial, social and ethical impacts of deploying algorithms in the criminal justice system in order to develop evidence-based policies.<br/> <br/>This project has four main objectives. First, using crime mapping as a lens of inquiry, the project will investigate the perceptions of financial, social and ethical dimensions of algorithmic crime analysis, to uncover both qualitative and quantitative insights about how laypeople and experts perceive its various implications. Second, the research will deconstruct popular algorithms used in crime analysis in order to understand specific points at which bias may occur and statistically better variants that may mitigate them. Third, it will compare and contrast each biased variant with its less biased counterpart to compute metrics about financial, social and ethical impacts, providing quantitative implications for biased criminal justice policy. Fourth, as a result of the first three objectives, this proposal will help expand initial efforts to build a community of like-minded scholars, though organizing a summer workshop involving practitioners, researchers and students to educate and co-create a community of practice around ethical, fair, accountable and transparent algorithms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But to the contrary, moments of inattention to our surroundings may be essential to the formation of memory. This project will test the hypothesis that even when we seem to be sitting still and doing nothing, the mind and brain are continuously switching between two distinct states - one in which we are focused on processing our immediate external environment (an 'online' state), and another during which we ignore our immediate surroundings and turn our attention toward internally generated activity, including thinking of the past and planning for the future (an 'offline' state). This project tests the hypothesis that the early stages of memory processing occur specifically during moments of this offline state, interspersed throughout our day. By developing new methods of measuring these waking states and their function, this work will help to move us toward a more accurate understanding of wakefulness as an oscillation between distinct processing modes that are essential for the formation and retention of long-term memories. As a part of NSF's RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) program, this project will also provide high-quality research training for approximately 12 undergraduate students across the course of 3 years, including members of underrepresented minority groups and students from underserved public high schools in South Carolina.<br/><br/>Studies of human memory have typically treated wakefulness as a homogenous state. But to the contrary, moment-to-moment alternation between online attention to the current environment and offline attention to internally generated thought and imagery may be a fundamental feature of the waking state, occurring even in the absence of a directed cognitive task. Although we all experience such attentional fluctuations throughout the day, the structure and function of these short bouts of offline time remain almost entirely unknown. The objective of the current project is to model this temporal microstructure of wakefulness in human subjects, assessing the functional relevance of fluctuation between online and offline attentional states to memory processing. The central hypothesis is that the early stages of memory consolidation occur specifically during these offline moments interspersed throughout the day. This hypothesis is based in part on the researcher's preliminary data describing features of these proposed states of wakefulness using simultaneous high-density EEG, pupillometry, behavioral, and subjective report measures. To test the hypotheses, the research team will pursue two specific aims. Aim 1 will model the transition between online and offline waking states at seconds-level temporal resolution, using simultaneous high-density EEG, pupillometry, behavioral, and subjective report measures. Aim 2 will assess the contribution of spontaneous offline time to memory consolidation. Together, these studies will test the novel hypothesis that a fast-timescale alternation between online and offline attentional states is essential for memory consolidation to occur. This work thus challenges the traditional view of wakefulness as a unified state, instead describing wake as an oscillation between statistically discriminable cortical states, each with different cognitive functions. <br/><br/>We anticipate that this work will lead to two main scientific advances. First, this project will develop a new, data-driven model of the alternation between waking states in human subjects. The classification algorithms to be developed will allow future investigators to more easily and objectively detect and measure offline time, while providing a uniquely comprehensive description of the heterogeneous structure of wakefulness. Second, the project will test the relevance of fluctuation between waking states to memory consolidation, resolving a continued uncertainty in the field of memory research regarding the brain state(s) during which consolidation occurs, and the timescale(s) on which it operates. Finally, as a part of NSF's RUI (Research in Undergraduate Institutions) program, this project will also strengthen the undergraduate STEM pipeline in an underserved region of the country, providing high-quality research training to approximately 12 undergraduate students, including members of underrepresented minorities and local high school students in South Carolina.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Perception Action & Cognition Program, the Cognitive Neuroscience Program, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The estimated cost of defending against and responding to hacking incidents currently runs at hundreds of billions of dollars annually.  To reduce these costs, many organizations have aimed to develop timely, relevant, actionable, and shareable Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) about security and privacy threats to support cybersecurity decision-making.  However, existing methods tend to react to known threats rather than proactively detecting emerging ones.  One promising approach to proactive exploit detection is mining large, international, and rapidly evolving online hacker community platforms to detect emerging threats and key actors.  To this end, this project aims to develop advanced, proactive CTI capabilities through (1) collecting large, dynamic datasets of hacker forum posts and (2) developing methods to analyze them to extract emerging threats, particularly malware, through a novel graph-based method for modeling text content.  <br/><br/>To achieve these goals, this project aims to develop a novel CTI framework designed to collect and identify emerging threats from multi-million record hacker forums.  To address the problem of collecting large-scale and dynamic datasets, the team will develop advanced obfuscated crawling mechanisms that bypass automated collection countermeasures while requiring minimal human involvement.  The data collected will be segmented into time spells and analyzed by a novel computational algorithm, the Diachronic Graph Convolutional Autoencoder (D-GCAE). D-GCAE is rooted in methods drawn from the diachronic linguistics, network science, text mining, and deep learning communities.  In this project, D-GCAE will extract graph embeddings at each time spell, align embeddings, and analyze semantic shifts of hacker terminology to identify potential emerging threats.  These tools will be evaluated against both state-of-the-art benchmarks proposed in computer science and related domains and through analysis of their outputs by leading CTI sharing organizations. The datasets and tools will also be disseminated for use by cybersecurity researchers, practitioners, and educators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While its evolution has largely mirrored that of photography, the state of graphics today is unfortunately like that of photography in the mid-1900s when creating a good image required being a trained professional with an intimate understanding of light and the peculiarities of the available tools. Since then, photography has witnessed a revolution where smartphone cameras produce technically superior images while hiding this complexity; this democratization has enabled a vast array of new applications. The goal of the current project is to enable the same revolution for the ""virtual photographs"" created using computer graphics algorithms. This will require developing new ways of expressing numerical light transport simulations which relax current assumptions on the input and output of the rendering process, leading to automatic ""point and click"" rendering algorithms which avoid manual parameter tuning. Project outcomes will have far-reaching and broad impact on all application areas that currently rely on accurate and efficient light transport simulation, from diagnosing illnesses, to self-driving cars, to video games and films, to designing and manufacturing products. More importantly, they will democratize these tools beyond trained professionals, much like ""point and shoot"" smartphone cameras have done for photography. An integrated educational and outreach program will increase diversity and support underrepresented groups by building on the host institution's existing strengths in STEM and Digital Arts, and will leverage the appeal of animated films to teach otherwise abstract mathematics and physics concepts to students from a broad range of ages and socio-economic backgrounds.<br/><br/>While computer graphics rendering can produce the realistic and beautiful imagery we see in movies today, the algorithms used to achieve these results are brittle and require tuning by skilled practitioners. They focus almost entirely on mimicking traditional camera/optical systems that were designed for use by people, which limits their applicability to emerging imaging modalities. And they still struggle to render common scenes due to unrealistic assumptions about the physical world and the light transport within it. Broadening the reach of computer graphics requires addressing these core challenges. Firstly, this project will establish a new framework for expressing Monte Carlo light transport strategies and a method to computationally determine which ones should be used on which scenes. This will lead to more robust and automatic ""point and click"" rendering algorithms which avoid manual parameter tuning with heuristics. The research will also extend current rendering approaches beyond 2D RGB images for broader impact on inverse problems using modern imaging systems. Lastly, the work will lift long-held statistical assumptions about light transport and scene/material representations, laying the theoretical and algorithmic foundation for universal level of detail and increased artistic control. Project outcomes will have far-reaching impact in all application domains relying on computer graphics rendering, and will add valuable basic knowledge about non-classical transport to related domains like nuclear engineering and atmospheric science. More broadly, the work will shift the focus of future rendering research towards robust and automatic rendering algorithms to democratize these tools beyond computer graphics professionals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One possibility to tackle this problem is to utilize an electron's ""spin"" rather than its charge, which requires less energy and produces less heat. Translating this approach to emerging nano-scale materials is likely to reveal approaches for miniaturized low-power spin-based electronics functioning at the smallest length scales possible. This research focuses on understanding how to orient and transport spin and spin-analogs in nanomaterial systems that harness the advantages of the ultimate atomic-scale limit of single layered crystals. These efforts could have broad impact by making the advantages of layered atomically-thin materials available to spin-based devices, thereby helping to smooth adoption of these exciting materials for nano-scale technologies that surpass the functionality of existing well-understood bulk systems. The supported activities facilitate mentoring of the next generation scientific workforce fluent with the intersection of optics, quantum materials, and nano-science. This research integrates into pedagogical improvements to curriculum that promote scientific interest and enthusiasm for diverse students. <br/><br/>Technical description: The ability to use light to orient spins and induce spin currents has been a key tool in the study of spintronics in bulk materials. By studying several classes of non-centrosymmetric crystals that are already known to support spin-related phenomena, this research translates the advantages of optical methods used in three-dimensional spintronics to reveal novel effects in low dimensions. Going beyond previous work exploiting light to control spin, this project investigates several unanswered questions, including (i) how optically-excited spin transport evolves over low-dimensional interfaces, and (ii) can the non-centrosymmetric crystals common in two-dimensional materials enhance the ability to control optically-induced information. To address these questions, this research explores spin orientation and transport phenomena using two distinct, but complementary, approaches. The first theme exploits the unique atomic-scale interfacial and heterostructure capabilities of layered van der Waals materials to understand spin-valley currents. This activity aims to measure interface effects of the valley Hall effect in opto-electronic devices. The second thematic direction of this research explores predictions of favorable spin properties in few-layer mono-chalcogenides that suggest suitability of this material class for traditional optical spin orientation methods. This theme aims to measure optically-induced spin dynamics in indium selenide and control transfer of spin polarization between electron and nuclear spin ensembles. Research carried out toward these goals advances understanding of spin transport and optical orientation and expands the tools available for spin manipulation in two-dimensional materials, thereby creating opportunities for highly tailored miniaturized opto-electronics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has been demonstrated that software verification with mathematical methods is an important component in meeting this challenge. However, most extant verification projects and tools focus on demonstrating the functional correctness of software. They do not analyze important quantitative properties of software such as resource usage, side channels, and probabilistic guarantees, which are crucial for reliability and security. The project's novelty is the design and implementation of a general framework for quantitative verification that can be applied to analyze resource usage, probabilistic programs (that incorporate randomness), and side channels. The project's impact is that this framework enables software developers to reduce the energy consumption of data centers, to mitigate serious security vulnerabilities, and to connect statistical safety guarantees to software systems that have machine-learning components. The project also provides a pedagogical opportunity for curriculum development and outreach activities. Quantitative verification and analysis tools implemented in the project are being integrated in Carnegie-Mellon's undergraduate courses on functional programming and data structures and algorithms, to both help students reason about the complexity of their code, and help instructors and teaching assistants automatically grade programming assignments by verifying complexity requirements. As part of the project's outreach activities, the investigator is designing two course modules for high-school students that are rolled out through existing programs at Carnegie-Mellon.<br/><br/>Current research on quantitative analysis and verification is often problem-specific, separated into manual or automatic techniques, and there is little cross-fertilization between different areas. The aim of this project is to develop Marlin, a unified framework for quantitative verification. A distinctive feature of Marlin is the tight integration of interactive and automatic reasoning. This includes converting manually derived quantitative properties into constraints that can be consumed by automatic techniques and supporting more lightweight forms of automation beyond full inference. Marlin is based on a full-featured probabilistic programming language and an expressive quantitative program logic that supports compositional and relational reasoning. Specific innovations of Marlin include easily-understood descriptions of sub-languages for which the automation is guaranteed to succeed, the automatic generation of worst-case inputs, tail-bound analysis with higher moments, and automatic relational reasoning.  Marlin's foundation is shared by three specialized quantitative analysis tools: Resource Aware ML (RaML), a language for static resource analysis; ParML, a new language for side-channel free programming; and Borel, a tool for probabilistic inference.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, learning-enabled systems have shown to be very sensitive to training data and have difficulty in ensuring functional safety and robustness. The undesired outcomes of recent deployments, such as the accidents involving semi-autonomous vehicles, raise questions about the design principles needed to build learning-enabled systems that are safe. This project aims to develop the foundations of a novel methodology for the design and verification of learning-enabled CPS. It will pursue a compositional framework and computational tools that can reason about the uncertainty and approximation introduced by learning components and enable system design via a hierarchical and modular approach. The proposed research can have a highly positive influence on the design and real-world deployment of safe and cost-effective autonomous systems for a variety of applications, including autonomous driving, robotics, and industrial automation. Moreover, it has the potential to offer a unifying framework for reasoning about a number of robust and fault-tolerant design approaches that are currently based mostly on ad hoc solutions. Collaborations with industry partners will be pursued to facilitate transitioning the research findings into practice. An educational plan including new undergraduate and graduate courses and a program for pre-college students will complement the research effort, aiming to educate the next generation of engineers and researchers on the concepts and the multidisciplinary attitude needed to realize ""intelligent"" systems that are safe, technologically and economically feasible, and seamlessly interacting with people.<br/><br/>The project develops a compositional framework for reasoning about the probabilistic behaviors of CPS built out of unreliable components.

The framework will be vertically-integrated and offer mapping mechanisms to bridge heterogeneous models and heterogeneous decomposition architectures in the design hierarchy. It will provide computational tools to efficiently solve verification and synthesis problems with stochastic contracts. Finally, it will offer mechanisms to monitor requirements throughout the entire system life-cycle and provide assurance both at design time and runtime.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algae are microscopic organisms that drift in the water columns of lakes and oceans. They form the foundation of the aquatic food web and produce approximately 50% to 85% of the world's oxygen via photosynthesis. Their population persistence is critical to ecosystem health. However, harmful algal blooms are a serious problem in some bodies of water, including Lake Erie. Blooms can be caused by the reversal of the competition between toxin-producing algae and the non-toxic diatoms. In well-mixed environments, cyanobacteria are competitively excluded by diatoms, but in poorly mixed or stratified water the toxic cyanobacteria float upwards to form surface scum and exclude diatoms. Hydrologic measures, such as altering the turbulent mixing in lakes, can solve the problem under appropriate conditions. This project will use mathematical models to understand the competition among phytoplankton and help design more effective hydrologic control strategies. Innovative mathematical analysis will be performed to quantify the effect of various environmental processes in shaping the population dynamics of phytoplankton. This project will provide research topics for PhD students and undergraduate summer projects. The undergraduate mentorship will be leveraged with the Summer Undergraduate Capstone Conference of the Mathematical Biosciences Institute at Ohio State University. <br/><br/>This project aims to understand the effect of environmental drivers, including spatial heterogeneity, non-uniform mixing, and light and nutrient availability, in shaping the community structure of a diverse phytoplankton population. We will develop phytoplankton population models of a single species, multiple species, and a continuous spectrum of species to address four key biological questions: (1) In eutrophic conditions nutrients are abundant, but light is limited. How does water column stratification affect the persistence of a single species? (2) Human activities have accelerated the eutrophication of many freshwater lakes and coastal ecosystems, causing harmful algal blooms to emerge. Can artificial mixing create a competitive reversal, allowing non-toxic diatoms to competitively exclude the toxic algae? (3) Phytoplankton communities are diverse and can be structured along various functional trade-offs. How do trade-offs in light acquisition affect  coexistence among phytoplankton species? (4) How do nutrient dynamics influence phytoplankton competition in spatially heterogeneous environments? For two-species competing in stratified water columns, long-term dynamics will be classified by monotone dynamical systems results. A significant methodological advance of this project is the game-theoretical approach of using mutation-selection models.

Information obtained from this research may be useful in assessing and predicting the potential health effects of peptoids.  The results could lead to applications of peptoids in medical technologies, either as drugs or as components of biosensors or medical devices. The research is performed at a primarily undergraduate institution, where exposure of undergraduate students to authentic research experiences both in teaching and research labs engages a diverse cross-section of students, including women and underrepresented minorities. The research aims are integrated with undergraduate education activities, for example, students in a second-term organic chemistry teaching lab synthesize the library of water-soluble peptoids.  Educational exercises utilizing research-derived data is developed to improve quantitative skills of first-generation college (FGC) students in general chemistry.  Undergraduate research students are selected from the FGC student cohort in Professor Stokes' general chemistry course to work in her research lab. Through the research and educational activities, FGC students gain experience using modern laser spectroscopy methods and computational tools, which better prepares them for graduate school and future careers. Protocols and principles used to train undergraduate students to conduct nonlinear optical experiments and computational-guided inquiry exercises are broadly disseminated through workshops, websites, presentations, and publications to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in the STEM workforce. <br/><br/>Accurate models to predict membrane penetration by and accumulation of small organic molecules inform rational drug design. These models require a quantitative understanding of the thermodynamic forces which control interactions between lipid (fatty) membranes and molecules with varying hydrophobicity, charge, polarizability and 3-D structure. In this study, a diverse library of systematically-varied peptoids (N-substituted glycine oligomers) is synthesized. The impact of lipid composition on peptoid-lipid interactions is also probed using artificial plasma membranes. High-throughput experiments are conducted using nonlinear optical imaging and spectroscopy methods to determine how peptoid sequence and membrane composition impact the orientation and number of adsorbed peptoids. The thermodynamic dataset provides quantitative structure-function relationships which relate peptoid structure and lipid composition to free energies of adsorption.  Complementary education activities integrate computational guided inquiry modules into general chemistry courses to improve quantitative skills and increase retention of first-generation college students in gateway courses for STEM majors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since this is a relatively unexplored material, there is a need to establish its basic properties, including parameters that are important for understanding how the material will behave under high electric fields. The research is particularly addressing the impact ionization coefficients, which are currently not established experimentally. The proposed research plan is tackling these parameters at different electric fields and temperatures and is comparing them to the established theory for high voltage behavior in other semiconductor materials. The research, which combines both experimental studies and advanced simulations, is aimed at developing a fundamental understanding of the way in which electrons and holes behave in this promising wide bandgap semiconductor. The role of defects and impurities on the high voltage characteristics of this material impacts a range of technologies including power control electronics in electric vehicles and associated charging infrastructure, ultraviolet emitters and detectors and high frequency/high temperature electronics. The activities provide collaborative research opportunities for a graduate student and several undergraduate students and also engages high school students from underrepresented groups and economically disadvantaged backgrounds.<br/><br/>Technical description: The research focuses on fundamental studies of the breakdown mechanism and the role of common defect types and their density on carrier multiplication in gallium oxide. This is a promising material for high power, high temperature systems applications. This proposal will establish basic materials parameters and their electric field and temperature dependence, which are needed to understand the carrier transport and multiplication mechanisms in gallium oxide. The fundamental relations governing the electron and hole transport at high electric fields and over a range of temperatures in gallium oxide needs to be established experimentally. More specifically, the experimental studies focus on examining the temperature dependence of impact ionization coefficients using carrier injection into structures which are biased at a variety of voltages to establish an electric field. The carrier multiplication anticipated under such conditions effect can also be affected by the type and density of defects in the material and this needs to be quantified by examining samples with different defect densities. The research employs electrical characterization techniques, including temperature-dependent current-voltage and diffusion length measurements, with structural analysis using transmission electron microscopy with chemical analysis to provide detailed insights on how defects affect the breakdown characteristics of gallium oxide at high voltages. The experiments are supported by advanced electrical simulations as a function of temperature and voltage, which are used to study the expected influence of these parameters on impact ionization of carriers and transport through the gallium oxide layers. The studies are establishing the transport parameters, which are relevant not only for the basic materials science but also for understanding high temperature operation of gallium oxide based power electronics and solar-blind photodetectors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, combinatorics and geometry have benefitted each other tremendously in recent years, both by the ways in which they are connected directly, and by learning from each other?s philosophies and techniques. This project studies the discrete structure of algebraic and geometric objects, and the algebraic and geometric structure of matroids and polytopes. This interdisciplinary perspective offers unexpected and effective approaches to long-standing problems. This research program constitutes the academic backbone of a vibrant research and training collaboration among primarily undergraduate institutions in the U.S. and Colombia. Through research-based courses, vertically and geographically integrated research projects, and the biannual Encuentro Colombiano de Combinatoria, students participate in a truly international cooperation while making substantial scientific contributions to combinatorics. Since 2007 this initiative has trained more than 150 pre-Ph.D. U.S. students, more than half of whom are members of underrepresented groups in mathematics, and more than 50 of whom have gone onto Ph.D. programs. The initiative also serves mathematicians worldwide through the distribution of course videos, lecture notes, and research projects.<br/><br/>This project studies three interdisciplinary and interrelated research directions: 1. By studying the geometric structure of matroids, we obtain purely combinatorial results that seem intractable without the geometric perspective, and we establish foundational results in tropical geometry and combinatorial Hodge theory. 2. We measure polytopes of interest by recognizing that they are part of ?the right? family of polytopes, and finding a formula for the measure of all the polytopes in that family. The results have consequences in toric geometry and representation theory. 3. We explore the Hopf-algebraic structure of various families of polytopes. The resulting objects are useful in numerous combinatorial and algebraic applications, and they raise geometric questions of independent interest. At the heart of each of these three projects lies a configuration of vectors - usually a root system - that plays an essential role. The combinatorial theories of polytopes and (Coxeter) matroids are designed to study such configurations, and the powerful toolkit that they offer is the unifying thread of this project. Solutions to the proposed problems will have a strong impact in combinatorics and discrete geometry, and will further our understanding of central questions in algebra and geometry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Memory stranding is a pervasive problem in such containerized datacenters, where many memory-intensive applications grind to a halt even when free memory exists in other machines. This leads to low utilization, memory fragmentation, and overall increased cost. Memory disaggregation over ultra-fast networks can pool together such stranded memory in theory, but making it practical faces novel systems design, algorithmic, and integration challenges. They include bridging the still-sizable latency gap between local memory access vs. Remote Direct Memory Access (RDMA), transparently addressing network-wide fault-tolerance, load imbalance, and performance isolation issues, scalability, and enabling support for heterogeneous software and hardware technologies.<br/><br/>The overarching research objective of this proposal is to realize a Unified Disaggregated Memory (UDM) abstraction over ultra-fast networks to expose stranded memory across the datacenter as a pool of available memory to out-of-memory containers in a fast, resilient, and scalable manner without any changes to the applications. By designing a comprehensive solution to address host-level, network-level, and end-to-end aspects of the aforementioned challenges, this research aims to make memory disaggregation practical. Specifically, by leveraging the unique characteristics of memory-intensive workloads, ultra-low-latency networks, and multi-tenancy in modern datacenters, this proposal will (i) design a low-latency host networking stack; (ii) enable performance isolation throughout the network; (iii) provide resilience to network-wide uncertainties such as failures and load imbalance; and (iv) incorporate support for heterogeneous memory (e.g., persistent memory), networking technologies, and resource management software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to their oscillatory motion waves move sediments back and forth and the net transport, averaging over many waves and conditions, is responsible for accretion or erosion of beaches. Shoreward sediment transport is critical to understanding how beaches rebuild in response to rising sea levels, storms, and the construction of engineered coastal structures. Improved understanding of shoreward transport, the focus of this study, will enable better model parameterizations to predict this response and forecast the potential recovery of the coastline following a storm. The fundamental processes underlying wave-driven shoreward transport are among the least understood and most elusive processes in nearshore oceanography. Numerous competing theoretical mechanisms are likely to contribute, but there is a critical lack of validation data to determine their relative importance.  The proposed work is an interdisciplinary collaboration that brings together oceanography, fluid dynamics, and engineering to address the scientific fundamentals of a problem with significant societal implications. Field measurements of turbulence and sediment will be carried out on a natural beach. The experimental data will be combined with advance numerical modelling techniques that will allow identification of the most important wave-driven shoreward mechanisms on a natural beach. Apart for the scientific and engineering values of the study, the project will provide contribute to the training PhD students and it will expose undergraduate students into field research. Public outreach will be conducted through the development of short documentary-style video.<br/><br/>Modeling shoreward transport requires representation of multiple transport processes that act across a broad range of scales, from small-scale turbulence, sediment mobilization, and fluid-sediment feedbacks, to wavelength-scale nonlinear wave processes. In the past, direct investigation of such processes has only been possible in laboratory studies, which have uncertain applicability to real nearshore environments due to scaling effects and simplified dynamics. Full-scale experiments, on the other hand, represent realistic dynamics but often sacrifice resolution, e.g. by only measuring average transport over many wave periods, leaving uncertainty as to what processes are contributing to transport. The key components of this study are the utilization of a purpose-built, broadband pulse-coherent acoustic Doppler profiler (MFDop), and detailed process models, which together resolve the full suite of transport mechanisms that have been hypothesized to occur on natural beaches. The MFDop system is a profiler, capable of measuring sediment concentration and velocity fluctuations at high frequency (50 Hz) and with a vertical resolution of 4 mm capable of resolving the wave boundary layer that extends a few cm above the seabed. The MFDop system and supporting instrumentation will be deployed on a natural beach in Oregon to measure the vertical structure of boundary layer velocities and sediment suspension as a function of the free-stream velocity and pressure gradient. The data collected will guide modeling experiments simulating flow and sediment variability at wavelength and cm-scales (Reynolds-averaged 1-D vertical simulations) and at sub-cm to sub-mm scales capable to resolve boundary layer eddies and sediment particles (Large eddy simulation (LES) modelling). A nested approach will be developed aiming at adding wavelength-effects into LES modelling while avoiding computational limitation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additionally, randomness is a key component in many algorithms used to process and understand big data.  Crucial to analyzing such models and algorithms is understanding precisely how the randomness and nonlinear effects, i.e. the excitation, combine to relax the system to equilibrium.  The research supported by this award will seek to quantify rates of convergence to equilibrium in a number of models in statistical physics, turbulence and molecular dynamics, especially in those systems used in random sampling algorithms.  The project includes collaborations with high school, undergraduate and graduate students, the results of which will be disseminated through publications and through presentations at domestic and international conferences.  <br/><br/>This award supports several projects at the interface of stochastic analysis and dynamics.  The first part of this research focuses on extracting explicit rates of convergence to equilibrium for stochastic differential equations (SDEs) used in random sampling algorithms.  Of particular importance is understanding the precise nature of convergence in high dimensions in the presence of singular coefficients in the equations.  Such singularities arise naturally in the context of molecular dynamics (e.g. Lennard-Jones, Coloumb potential functions) as they are used to describe repulsive effects as particles approach one another.  Although natural from a modeling and statistical standpoint, the singularities lead to challenges in both analyzing the dynamics itself as well as in analyzing the corresponding numerical simulation due to energy spikes generated by the singular interactions.  The second part focuses on studying large-time properties of various statistical models in turbulence.  In each of these models, there is also a source of energy often leading to interesting effects in equilibrium such as, for example, heavy-tailed invariant measures.  Understanding how randomness, nonlinearities, dissipation as well as the excitation balance out to produce these interesting effects is of central importance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One challenge in developing a general modeling framework is that developmental biases are unique to the structure and species in question. This research will incorporate models of cartilage and bone growth into an evolutionary framework. The researchers will build on recent comparisons of ear structures among toads; many toad species have impaired ear development and lack structures commonly important for hearing. The project will bring together researchers and students with mechanical engineers to create a mathematical model that predicts ear structures based on developmental parameters. The model will examine evolutionary changes that can switch whether or not toad species develop ears. This framework will form a general foundation that can be applied to other structures to understand how developmental processes limit possible outcomes of mutations. The increased collaboration between engineers and biologists will provide key educational opportunities for all participants. The project includes developing courses and activities that will help undergraduates, graduate students, and professors learn evolutionary modeling methods.<br/><br/>To accomplish these goals, the PI has recruited three mentors to model the effects of developmental biases on morphological diversity: an engineer who models biological processes, a leading evolutionary developmental biologist who studies neural crest and cartilage development in amphibians, and an expert in phylogenetically based models of evolution. The scientist and the engineer will work together in cross-disciplinary courses to gain complementary expertise and train CSU students. They will adapt models of cartilage growth to explore the extent to which cell size, density, and local chemical environments influence ear development and also which cell-cell or cell-environment interactions could alter morphology. These models will generate testable predictions that will guide experiments in collaboration with the evolutionary developmental biologist and will be incorporated into an explicit evolutionary framework under the guidance of the phylogenetic modeler.

Systems with noise/disorder are often studied by probabilistic methods and assume that the noise is random. The main scope of the project is to study systems where the noise has additional structure and has deterministic (non-random) nature. In physics, strong random disorder often implies that the system becomes an insulator and prevents electrons in it from moving freely. Would it also be true for some systems with non-random disorder? If yes, which properties make non-random systems behave like random and can it be measured? Are there any additional effects if the disorder is not strong? The main goal of the project is to address these questions on many levels, which will include work with undergraduate and graduate students, development of graduate courses on dynamics and spectral theory, and developing a course for high school students that would illustrate connections between basic linear algebra and physics, providing them skills and motivation for possible further education in STEM.<br/><br/>This project incorporates teaching and research activities on the analysis of a class of models of mathematical quantum physics, including developing abstract techniques of operator theory and establishing rigorous results on more concrete systems. All proposed models involve disorder, however, unlike usual probabilistic view on disordered systems, the main goal will be studying the disorder in a completely deterministic setting, or with a very small number of random/ergodic parameters. An example of such system would be a Schrodinger operator with dynamically-defined potential, where the underlying dynamical system has small dimension and low degree of mixing (for example, irrational rotation). Typically, quantum systems with large random disorder tend to prevent electrons from moving freely (Anderson localization). To answer even basic questions about electron transport in deterministic disordered systems, one must replace usual probabilistic methods by methods of number theory, ergodic theory, semi-algebraic geometry, and other deep areas. The main directions of the project involve analysis of localization/delocalization for systems of interacting quasiperiodic particles and the effect of interaction, perturbative methods for single-particle operators with rough potentials, perturbation properties for spectral bands of periodic operators, and abstract methods of operator theory applied to almost commuting operators and matrices, with applications to quantum systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most mutations in genes that are required for bone elongation produce a proportionately dwarfed skeleton. Scientists know very little about how a bone's growth rate is locally determined to be faster or slower than other bones in the skeleton. By comparing gene expression differences in two rodents with very different skeletons, the mouse and bipedal jerboa with extremely long feet, the Cooper laboratory identified a number of genes that are excellent candidates to control growth rate differences within and between species. The project detailed in this NSF CAREER award will take advantage of the ability to quickly and easily over-express genes in the developing chicken skeleton to test the prediction that 30 of these candidate genes, which are not known to control skeletal development, are each sufficient to increase or decrease bone growth rate. The methods to visualize and analyze these manipulated skeletons are ideally suited to engage high school students in hands-on research experience. This project is therefore designed to provide a potentially transformative learning opportunity for hundreds of ""at risk"" students in an under-served community, in addition to expanding knowledge of the genetic control of skeletal growth and proportion. <br/><br/>The Cooper laboratory has capitalized on the striking difference in hindlimb proportions of the mouse and bipedal jerboa, similarity of their forelimbs, and the relatively close phylogenetic relationship (last common ancestor ~55 million years ago) to identify genes by RNA-Seq with expression differences that robustly associate with relative growth rates. These genes form a predicted interaction network that is highly enriched for pathways that are known to influence skeletal growth (e.g. WNT, Notch, and proteoglycan signaling), though many of the individual genes that were identified have no known growth plate function. They will focus on a set of 30 genes that show the strongest evidence for modular expression in the limb skeleton; gene expression changed during the evolution of accelerated elongation of the jerboa foot and remained unchanged in the forelimb that grows similar to mouse. In order to identify causative mechanisms that modulate skeletal growth rate, the lab will implement a powerful retroviral mis-expression system in the developing chicken wing skeleton to test the hypothesis that each gene is sufficient to accelerate or inhibit skeletal elongation. The objectives will rapidly expand what is known of the molecular toolkit that controls skeletal proportion and will contribute to mapping modular enhancers that control growth plate-specific gene expression and thus the development and evolution of skeletal proportion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, understanding and controlling these processes is challenging because energy is generally expended quickly but stored slowly. For example, filming a speeding bullet (energy flow) poses different challenges than filming a flower growing (energy storage). In this project, funded by the Chemical Structure Dynamics and Mechanisms (CSDM-A) program of the Chemistry Division, Professor Cody W. Schlenker of the University of Washington (UW) is using advanced laser techniques to provide fundamental understanding of how light absorption drives chemical reactions, two processes with rates as different as the velocity of a speeding bullet and the growth of a flower. The scientific knowledge gleaned from this project has the potential to improve sunlight-to-fuel conversions, solar water decontamination, and possibly even new avenues for light-driven industrial chemical production. Professor Schlenker's Research-Integrated Science Education (RISE) Program focusses on helping to equip low-income and potential first-generation college students with the tools needed to apply to college, succeed in STEM majors, and enter the STEM workforce. The group integrates research and education to develop new peer-generated science tutorials presented by students from the most ethnically and culturally diverse public high-schools in Washington State (e.g. Chief Sealth High School in Southern West Seattle through a partnership with the UW's Math & Science Upward Bound program). One example product of the RISE Program: Step-by-step, peer-led-learning video science experiments are distributed freely on a RISE-dedicated YouTube channel. The research group also leverages existing UW resources, for example, through a partnership with the UW Clean Energy Institute. Organic photochemistry may lay the conceptual groundwork for new research in the field of solar water splitting. Cheap and scalable solar hydrogen could positively impact energy and food sustainability, since ammonia fertilizer production is resource intensive.<br/><br/>The scientific objective of this project is to understand the role of inter-molecular excited states in the photochemistry of hydrogen-bonded molecular complexes. This research is focused particularly on understanding how nitrogen-containing molecules known as azaarenes photochemically react by removing hydrogen atoms from water and alcohols. To achieve this goal, the research team uses spectroscopic and electrochemical signals associated with transient, photogenerated, excited-states and free radicals. The population of these species are monitored as a function of the temporal delay between an initial ultrafast visible laser pulse (pump) and a subsequent infrared pulse (push) using transient absorption, photoluminescence, and electrical current detection. This approach is notable because it has the potential to extract ultrafast time information from the relative yields of much slower chemical reactions. Azaarenes play critical roles in photosynthetic assemblies, DNA photo-protection, photo-stabilization of industrial pigments, and they are common chromophores in renewable energy research focused on proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET). In these capacities, azaarenes can hydrogen-bond with hydroxyl groups. These hydrogen bonding interactions often alter the chromophore's photophysics and photochemical reactivity in seemingly unintuitive ways. The critical mechanistic links between the branching ratio among ultrafast photophysical pathways and the much slower subsequent photochemical reactions of azaarene molecules may constitute a step forward. Broader impacts of this work include potential societal benefits resulting from clarifying whether inter-molecular electronic excited-states that arise from hydrogen bonding interactions serve as a chemical gateway to photon-initiated reactions. Additionally, this project provides training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, integrating research concepts into public engagement activities for science outreach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To mitigate this safety risk, batteries include additional housing and safety features, and while this improves safety during operation, this strategy also increase the size and weight of the battery.  An alternative strategy is to replace the flammable liquid with a plastic membrane that allows ions, such as lithium, to pass through without allowing electrons to pass.  Prof. Winey's group has been studying single-ion conducting polymers that could be valuable for battery applications and for other membrane applications.  In previous NSF-funded work they have uncovered a variety of new nanoscale structures that arise when the active chemical groups are evenly placed along a linear polymer molecule.  One of these nanoscale structures, an alternating layered arrangement of ions and crystalline polymer, was recently found to have exceptional proton transport properties when hydrated.  To capitalize on this finding, the PI has established new design rules for polymer membranes and built multiple collaborations with synthetic chemists who are incorporating these design concepts into new polymers.  Winey's group will explore the nanoscale structures and conductivities of these newly designed polymers as a function of their polymer chemistry and processing to refine and extend their design rules for single-ion conducting polymer membranes.  Given the current societal challenges related to clean water, energy storage and energy conversion, the fundamental understanding afforded by this project will have an important societal impact. <br/><br/><br/>PART 2:  TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>A strong interest in ionomers and other polymers with acid, ionic and polar groups is fueled by their potential ability to selectively transport charged species, which is relevant to batteries, water purification technologies, and fuel cells.  The prevailing research directions in the field of solid polymer electrolytes have consolidated around two general classes of homogeneous materials wherein the ions are uniformly distributed throughout the material:  polymers mixed with salts and single-ion conductors.  The ubiquitous design strategy in these materials systems is based on the understanding that ion conductivity is associated with chain dynamics and ions must be dissociated from their counterion.  Unfortunately, these approaches have only limited success in developing suitable polymer-based electrolytes.  Winey's group is exploring an alternative hypothesis, namely that efficient ion conductivity in polymers can be broadly achieved when the ions are sequestered into spatially-continuous nanoscale aggregates and the ions dissociate from their counterions. This project builds upon a promising result from the PI and collaborators wherein proton conductivity of a hydrated precise polyethylene with sulfonic acid groups on exactly every 21st carbon is somewhat higher than a commercial membrane.  This precise polyethylene self-assembled into nanoscale layers lined with the acid groups and separated by a crystalline alkyl spacer.  The high proton conductivity is evidence that the conducting protons are decoupled from the motion of the much slower polymer backbones.  The proposed project will expand upon this singular finding to establish the merits of the proposed alternative hypothesis. The planned research combines conductivity measurements, structural characterization, and molecular dynamics simulations to rigorously interrogate this hypothesis using new nanostructured precise polymers.  The proposed alkyl polyester sulfonates and telechelic oligomers are expected to have crystalline domains that direct the assembly of layered aggregates; these layered morphologies will be aligned in thin films on interdigitated electrodes to explore the fundamentals of conductivity.  Random percolated structures in precise polyethylenes with short carbon spacers will also be investigated.  The PI and her group will undertake this project with a set of unfunded collaborators:  Prof. Stefan Mecking (Konstanz), Prof. Justin Kennemur (Florida State University), Prof. Paul Nealey (U Chicago), Dr. Amalie Frischknecht (Sandia), and Dr. Mark Stevens (Sandia). <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bacteria and fungi utilize complex metalloenzymes to generate N2O from the natural starting material nitric oxide (NO), but the fundamental chemical mechanisms for this process are not understood. Therefore, there is an urgent need to probe and understand this component of the global N-cycle, in particular, the role that metals play in mediating the production and consumption of such NOx gases of environmental and agricultural importance. Collaborators Dr. George Richter-Addo and Dr. Michael Shaw study non-protein chemical analogues of complex bacterial and fungal metalloenzymes to probe N2O formation and NOx utilization by these organisms. In particular, the team is preparing, isolating, and characterizing unstable intermediates along observed reaction pathways. These studies allow for a better understanding of how these gases are produced and controlled, and how nitrogen, an essential element in fertilizer required for crop growth, can be improved. The collaborative team combines a Ph.D. environment (at the University of Oklahoma) and a primarily undergraduate environment (at Southern Illinois University Edwardsville) to provide high-level training to a diverse group of students. The team is also active in introducing at-risk high school students and the general public to modern science. Dr. George Richter-Addo participates in a summer program designed for inner city high school kids at high risk for failure in academic programs.

With funding from the Chemical Structure, Dynamics and Mechanisms-B Program of the NSF Chemistry Division, the collaborative research team of Dr. George Richter-Addo (University of Oklahoma) and Dr. Michael Shaw (Southern Illinois University Edwardsville) is determining the factors that lead to chemical reactivity of the bound NO ligand in synthetic porphyrin systems that model heme-containing enzymes in bacteria and fungi involved in N2O and/or organo-NOx generation. The collaborative team is determining the experimental conditions that favor nucleophilic attack of the bound NO ligand in ferric-NO porphyrins and promote N2O formation (via H-N bond formation; fungal N2O pathway) and organo-NOx generation (via C-N/N-N/S-N bond formation).  They are also determining the requirements for activating the bound NO ligand in ferrous-NO porphyrins towards N-N bond formation and N2O production (bacterial N2O pathway). The team utilizes a combination of chemical synthesis, spectroscopy, and advanced spectroelectrochemistry, complemented by density functional theory calculations for this research. The collaborative team is active in introducing at-risk high school students and the general public to modern science. In addition to developing new educational materials at the freshman (introductory chemistry) and graduate (electrochemistry) levels, the team actively participates in a summer program designed for ethnically diverse and economically disadvantaged inner-city high school children. The team also produces on-line lecture videos in a rich multilayer flexible online environment suitable for individuals with disabilities, thus representing an avenue of science outreach to a traditionally hard-to-reach underrepresented group.

Every day, machine learning systems influence our purchasing decisions, our navigation through virtual and physical spaces, the friendships we make, and even the romantic relationships we form.  The decisions automated by these systems have increasingly important real-world consequences, from credit scoring, to college admissions, to the prediction of re-offending behavior in the criminal justice system, as is already being used for bail and sentencing decisions across the United States of America.  With the growing impact of artificial intelligence and machine learning technologies on our society, and their importance to the economic competitiveness and technological leadership of the United States, it is imperative that we ensure that these systems behave in a fair and trustworthy manner.  Recent studies have shown that data-driven AI and ML systems can in some cases exhibit unfair and unjust behavior, for example due to biases hidden in the input data, or because of flawed engineering decisions.  This project develops a suite of tools for modeling, measuring, and correcting unfair and discriminatory behavior in AI and ML systems.  The research focuses on simultaneously addressing algorithmic discrimination that may occur across several overlapping dimensions, including gender, race, national origin, sexual orientation, disability status, and socioeconomic class.  The novel AI techniques developed in this project address the two main technical challenges which specifically arise in this context: uncertainty in the measurement of fairness, and correlations in the data.<br/><br/>When ensuring AI fairness regarding multiple protected dimensions such as gender and race, data sparsity rapidly becomes a challenge as the number of dimensions, or the number of values per dimension, increase.  This data sparsity directly results in uncertainty in the measurement of fairness.  The project will leverage Bayesian inference, a branch of statistics which specifically addresses uncertainty, to manage this issue.  Correlations between the protected (and other) attributes will be leveraged using probabilistic graphical models, a class of machine learning models which encode dependence relationships.   Using a novel Bayesian definition of fairness as a unifying framework, the project's contributions consist of three interdependent tracks.  The first track will focus on developing general modeling techniques for the statistically efficient measurement of fairness, using latent variable models to produce parsimonious representations, and hierarchical modeling to achieve data efficiency.  The second track develops adversarial optimization algorithms to train machine learning algorithms to respect fairness constraints when the data distribution is uncertain.  In the third track, the project will develop methods for ensuring fairness in Bayesian inference, which can be used to prevent the inferences from reflecting negative stereotypes. The methods will be validated with case studies on applications across a wide range of data regimes, including modeling census income data, criminal justice recidivism prediction, and social media analytics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, Dr. Schneebeli is imitating the natural assembly-line approach to create well-defined polymeric materials. While this research focuses on enabling and understanding artificial molecular assembly lines, the well-defined polymers created may ultimately be useful materials for a variety of important applications. The artificial molecular assembly lines are created by connecting a catalyst to the polymers with rings that slide along the growing chains. This catalyst adds individual building blocks to the growing polymers one by one.

This project designs systems that bridge the semantic gap between application semantics and hardware constraints. The project's novelties are type-driven approaches to balancing productivity with control over low-level performance details. The project's impacts are new programming languages for heterogeneous systems that avoid the usability pitfalls of best-effort C-language compilation, expose system-level concerns that dictate performance, and enable cross-device compiler optimizations.

The first approach lifts the latent constraints in one-off compilers for heterogeneous architectural backends into an intelligible type system. It addresses high-level synthesis (HLS) compilers for FPGAs, which attempt to translate a loosely-defined subset of C or C++ to hardware. The project aims to guarantee that well-typed programs have a realizable hardware implementation. The second approach embeds a higher level of abstraction into the type system for low-level computations to prevent bugs and enable new compiler optimizations. It focuses on linear algebra computations on GPUs. Such computations entangle abstract algebraic properties with low-level code. A new type system combines abstract types describing the linear algebra behavior with concrete types describing the GPU execution.

This strategy has the potential to prepare future STEM teachers who can meet the needs of diverse learners and contribute to the national priorities for STEM learning.<br/>  <br/>Through this effort, the University of Utah will work closely with Salt Lake Community College, the source of almost 1,000 of the University's STEM undergraduates.  These two key partners, together with Salt Lake City School District, master teachers, community leaders, and experts in high-need environments, will form the ""Utah Collaborative.""  The goals of the Utah Collaborative are to: 1) conduct a detailed needs assessment that determines the number of teachers needed and also the attributes such as soft-skills and dispositions that enable teachers to thrive in high-need environments; 2) create a compact five-year degree program that results in a STEM bachelor of science degree and a Master of Education, with licensure; 3) develop a direct pathway from Salt Lake Community College to completion of the BS/MEd program at the University of Utah; 4) develop unique student teaching opportunities and internships that will allow participants to gain extensive exposure to teaching in high-need schools; 5) develop a network of school and community-based mentors to help support new and continuing teachers; and 6) develop a strategic dissemination and advising plan that will enable the recruitment and support of STEM students from different backgrounds. Ultimately, the project aims to provide the infrastructure for a future Noyce Track 1 proposal that has the potential to transform science education in Utah.  The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will do so by building the capacity to help secondary mathematics teachers engage in culturally responsive teaching practices. Specifically, this project will modify the STEM teacher education curriculum at the University of Florida St. Petersburg to include training in culturally responsive teaching. Nationally, there is a significant need for grades 6-12 mathematics and science teachers. This teacher shortage is compounded by the need for teachers who are culturally responsive, which is the knowledge and skills that enable one to relate effectively to other cultures and, thus, to better meet the needs of diverse learners.  By making the proposed curriculum modifications, this project is expected to lay the foundation to support the development of teachers who have robust knowledge of STEM content and well-developed skills in effective STEM instructional techniques.    <br/><br/>This project is a partnership between the University of Florida St. Petersburg and Pinellas County Schools, the 7th largest school district in Florida and the 26th largest in the US. Nearly half of the Pinellas County students are from an underrepresented minority group and just over half receive free or reduced lunches.  Consequently, the need for culturally responsive teaching practices in Pinellas County Schools is critical.  This need is further underscored by the fact that underrepresented minority students and students of lower socio-economic status are also significantly less successful in mathematics and science. To address this need, the project partnership will facilitate the development of a culturally responsive teaching program and examine whether the program produces teachers who are well prepared to teach in high need schools, and who will be successful and persist in their teaching career. Because many other US school districts have diverse student populations, this project has the potential to improve many other teacher preparation programs. Thus, a goal of this project is to develop a structure that can be replicated elsewhere to ensure that other STEM education programs can provide effective teacher preparation that includes cultural responsiveness.  The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers.

They are integral to cellphones, laptops, scooters, electric vehicles, homes, solar installations, and even airplanes.  But these basic devices have potential safety hazards because they carry within a highly flammable liquid that has led to explosions and fires.  Building an intrinsically safe rechargeable lithium battery remains an unmet challenge, particularly in the development of a nonflammable electrolyte (the material that allows the flow of electrical charge in the battery) to replace the flammable organic liquid electrolyte in current lithium batteries.  Polymer electrolytes offer a promising alternative to the flammable liquid.  All previous studies have considered polymers made from organic building blocks.  The proposed work begins with a novel approach:  the synthesis of a hybrid polymer that comprises both organic and inorganic building blocks.  The polymer spontaneously forms 10-nanometer-wide alternating organic and inorganic layers (a human hair is 100,000 nanometers wide).  This material had very low flammability. The organic layers conduct the lithium ions while the inorganic layers provide mechanical rigidity to the polymer electrolyte, a property that is necessary to keep the two battery electrodes from touching and short-circuiting the battery.  The planned work examines the relationship between layer formation and lithium-ion motion through the composite electrolyte. The PIs collaborating on this project will also be working on diversity-related initiatives on the UC Berkeley campus, on organizing public lectures on scientific subjects aimed at high school students in Brooklyn, and  on providing multidisciplinary training to undergraduate and graduate students at their institutions.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION:<br/><br/>The proposed work focuses on mixtures of hybrid organic-inorganic block copolymers and a lithium salt.  Functionalized polyhedral oligomeric silsesquioxane (POSS) particles are covalently bonded to the inorganic block; the organic block is polyethylene oxide (PEO).  The hybrid block copolymers (PEO-POSS) will be synthesized using nitroxide-mediated radical polymerization with functionalized PEO as the macro-initiator.  Early results indicate that the phase behavior of pure PEO-POSS block copolymers is as expected: increasing temperature leads to an order-to-disorder transition. In contrast, salt-containing PEO-POSS mixtures exhibit a disorder-to-order transition with increasing temperature.  The effect of block ratio, chain length, and POSS functionality will be studied by a combination of depolarized light scattering, X-ray scattering, and electron tomography.  Measurements will be made over a wide range of block copolymer compositions, salt concentration, and annealing conditions.  The effect of morphology on ion transport will be measured by ac impedance spectroscopy.  The intellectual merit of the proposed work will be the study of the thermodynamic interactions and ion transport in an emerging class of hybrid nanostructured polymers comprising fully organic polymers and polymers with covalently-bonded inorganic nanoparticles; the present quantitative understanding of these properties is largely restricted to all-organic chains. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Particle image velocimetry uses lasers to infer fluid velocities by tracking particles in many applications involving single phase flows. However, many multiphase flows (such as bubbly flows in the wake of a ship) are important to understand, but these flows are opaque at visible wave lengths due to the refractive interfaces between the phases. Fortuitously, at X-ray wave lengths the change in refractive index between most fluids of interest is very small; therefore, X-ray based particle image (or tracking) velocimetry can measure fluid flow properties in multiphase flows. This project will develop a practical in-lab X-ray particle image velocimetry technique. The project will combine the use of numerical modelling and experiments to hopefully enable wider utilization of in-lab X-ray particle image velocimetry for multiphase fluid dynamics research.<br/><br/>This project will use a combination of first principle-based modelling and experiments, which together will yield a deeper understanding of the physical and technical capabilities and limitations of in-lab X-ray particle image velocimetry. The numerical modeling will utilize both established Monte Carlo codes and simpler codes based on Beer-Lambert law. The experiments will utilize photon counting X-ray detectors to determine the signal to noise ratios and introduce small tracer particles to enable velocity measurements without altering the flow. The project will develop algorithms and rules for balancing source, tracer, and detector characteristics and settings.  The project will validate the in-lab X-ray particle image velocimetry technique for the canonical pipe flow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding mantle flows has, thus, strong societal relevance. Seismology is a major tool when investigating mantle flows. Differences in seismic velocities, called seismic anisotropy, reflect the elastic anisotropy of mantle rocks. This anisotropy results from the properties of their constitutive minerals and from their deformation by convective flows. Here, the PI will experimentally measure the elastic anisotropy of various mantle minerals at the extreme pressures and temperatures prevailing in the Earth. From the data, rock seismic anisotropies can be calculated and compared with field observations. The experiments will be carried out at a national synchrotron facility, where powerful X-rays are generated, and in the PI's laser laboratory at University of New Mexico (UNM). The lasers and X-rays will be guided toward small mineral specimens pressurized in-between two diamonds. Mineral elastic properties can be extracted by quantifying the interaction between X-ray/laser beams and specimens which induces elastic waves in the minerals. Results from this project will improve the understanding of three critical zones in the Earth's mantle, located near plate boundaries and within the first few hundred kilometers underneath the surface. The project outcomes will be integrated into educational outreaches towards high-school students in Albuquerque (NM), notably from under-represented groups, as well as in a new introductory course at UNM. The project will also support two early-career scientists and provide training to one graduate student at UNM.<br/><br/>This proposal aims at better understanding the seismic anisotropy observed in three critical regions of the Earth's upper mantle: the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary, the mid-lithosphere discontinuity and the mantle wedge in subduction zones. The goal is to link the anisotropy to the elastic properties of the relevant minerals. The PI will perform experiments in the diamond-anvil cell at the high pressures and temperatures prevailing in the mantle. Single-crystal Brillouin spectroscopy at PI's laser spectroscopy laboratory and a national synchrotron facility, the Advance Photon Source (IL), will allow measuring the elastic constants of hydrogen-bearing olivine and pyroxenes and minerals from the amphibole and serpentine groups. Specimens will be prepared by focused ion beam and a novel scattering geometry will be implemented to ensure the success of the project. The research outcomes will be integrated into educational and outreach activities. The PI, an early-career female scientist, will work with teachers from Albuquerque high schools to encourage students to pursue STEM studies. A new introductory geoscience course will provide fun movie-discussion-exploration style learning experiences at University of New Mexico. The objective is to engage at an early stage more female and students from underrepresented groups into Earth Sciences careers.

Highly skilled parents deploy distinct strategies to cultivate their children's intellectual and socioemotional development, which in turn promotes intergenerational mobility. Yet we know little about whether and how parents' skills facilitate their children's access to two domains that also shape intergenerational mobility: neighborhoods and schools. In an era of housing market and educational enrollment changes that foster increased choice and information access (e.g., Section 8 housing vouchers, school choice policies), do parents' intellectual and socioemotional skills predict entry into neighborhood and school contexts conducive to their children's skill growth and educational success? Armed with more choices and more information than ever before, parents with higher cognitive and socioemotional skill levels may be more likely to raise their children in higher-quality neighborhoods and place them into higher-quality schools, even when comparing parents with similar demographic backgrounds, economic circumstances, and educational attainment levels. In turn, access to higher-quality neighborhoods and schools may meaningfully shape children's subsequent cognitive and socioemotional skill growth and their likelihood of high school graduation and college enrollment.  Findings from investigation of these propositions will contribute to debates over opportunity and urban policy.<br/><br/>To investigate the questions of this project, two kinds of statistical models will be built: (1) discrete choice models of neighborhood and school selection and (2) value-added models of neighborhood and school effects on children's cognitive and socioemotional growth.  The primary data source includes approximately 1,000 time-varying, geocoded residential and school enrollment histories, collected over about ten years in the 2000s. These data will be combined with individual-level measures of cognitive and socioemotional skills, demographic characteristics, and educational attainment, as well as time-varying household-level measures of income and wealth and neighborhood- and school-level quality data derived from census, geographic information system, and administrative (i.e., state and local government) sources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will address the need to educate teachers and students to engage in asking questions, collecting and interpreting data, making claims, and constructing explanations about real-world problems that matter to them. Science educators generally agree that science classrooms should provide opportunities for students to advance their thinking by engaging in critical conversations with each other as capable sense-makers. Despite decades of reform efforts and the use of experiential activities in science instruction, research indicates that classroom learning for students remains largely procedural, undemanding, and disconnected from the development of substantive scientific ideas. Furthermore, access to high-quality science instruction that promotes such complex thinking is scarce for students with diverse cultural and linguistic backgrounds. The project goals will be: (1) To design a year-long teacher professional development program; and (2) To study the extent to which the professional development model improves teachers' capacity to plan and implement inclusive science curricula. <br/><br/>This study will explore ways to enhance youths' learning experiences in secondary school classrooms (grades 6-12) by building a sustainable partnership between researchers and practitioners. The work will build on a previous similar activity with one local high school; plans are to expand the existing study to an entire school district over five years. The proposed work will be conducted in three phases. During Phase I, the study will develop a conceptual framework focused on inclusive science curricula, and implement the new teacher professional development program in 3 high schools with 15 science teachers. Phase II will expand to 6 middle schools in the school district with 24 teachers aimed at creating a continuous and sustainable research-practice partnership approach at the district. Phase III will focus on data analysis, assessment of partnership activities, dissemination, and planning a research agenda for the immediate future. The study will address three research questions: (1) Whether and to what extent does participating teachers' capacity of planning and implementing the curriculum improve over time; (2) How and why do teachers show differential progress individually and collectively?; and (3) What opportunities and constraints within schools and the school district shape teachers' development of their capacity to design and implement curricula? To address the research questions, the project will gather information about the quality of planned and implemented curriculum using both qualitative and quantitative data. Main project's outcomes will be: (1) a framework that guides teachers' engagement in planning and implementing inclusive science curricula; and (2) increased knowledge base on teacher learning.

Some organisms, like bacteria, are just a single cell. Others, including the plants, animals, and fungi that are large enough to be seen by the human eye, can consist of trillions of cells. The cells that make up different parts of a body are different from one another; skin cells are different from heart cells, just as root cells are different from leaf cells. Despite these differences, however, all cells have a lot in common. Much of the fundamental chemistry that underlies life takes place within cells, allowing organisms to grow, heal, and respond to their environment. This chemistry depends on the right molecules coming into contact with one another inside the cell, which requires complex coordination and transportation of millions of molecules. This molecular coordination and transportation is thus critical for life, but a major feature of a cell that affects how it works - the size of the cell itself - remains surprisingly understudied. In nature, cells exist in many sizes. The larger ones have a longer distance to travel from the cell surface to the nucleus, which is the cell's control center. Large cells also have more internal cellular space, which means that any two potentially interacting molecules can be farther apart from one another. Understanding how cells maintain function at different sizes is critical for understanding the fundamental question of how cells coordinate and transport the countless molecules required for life. <br/><br/>This study will focus on 10 species of salamanders with an exceptionally broad range of large cell sizes. Comparison across these species will allow the researchers to meet the following objectives: 1) study how increase in cell size impacts the function of molecular networks (i.e. gene regulatory networks, signal transduction cascades, metabolic pathways) through increased randomness in the interactions among molecules, 2) study how cells maintain function in the face of the increased randomness, decreased surface area, and increased volume that accompany large cell size, and 3) study how these changes at the cellular level impact the central traits of metabolism and embryonic development. These objectives will be met using mathematical modeling, comparative RNA sequencing, and cell ultrastructure microscopy. The research team consists of a mid-career principal investigator and two mentors, other scientists chosen for their strengths in mathematical modeling and cell size. Synergy across these labs will strengthen the investigator's ability to mentor young scientists in quantitative biology, and it will foster new collaborations among scientists to increase creativity and output.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hixon of the University of Notre Dame is supported by a CAREER award from the Environmental Chemical Sciences program in the Chemistry Division to study actinides.  The actinide elements are those with atomic numbers 89-103 (i.e., actinium through lawrencium, including uranium, thorium and plutonium). All actinides are radioactive; that is, they release energy upon radioactive decay. Several actinides (e.g. uranium) are used in nuclear reactors and nuclear weapons.  Americium is used in most modern smoke detectors. The actinides are important to society due to their use in medicine, power generation, and national security. Since the actinide elements are radioactive, they are far less studied than other elements on the periodic table. In this project, Dr. Hixon studies the environmental behavior of the actinide element plutonium using both experiments and models. The goal is to address the relationship between plutonium concentration, the particle size of the solid, and the structure of the solid. The education of a future workforce that understands the health and safety aspects of radioactive elements contributes directly to advancing national health and securing the national defense. By using the facilities at Los Alamos National Laboratory, this CAREER program gives students the opportunity to work within federal laboratory facilities leveraging and advancing new and novel techniques such as Pu-239 NMR spectroscopy. The nuclear energy lesson plan kits are a valuable resource for the South Bend Community School Corporation, which has a large minority student population.  Finally, the ""Get to Know Nuclear"" Girl Scout events serve as a platform to inspire young women to study science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.  <br/><br/>This project addresses the sorption and reduction of plutonium at the solid-water interface. Experiments involve batch experiments and spectroscopic analyses, such as X-ray absorption spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy, and magnetic susceptibility measurements.

A familiar example of a graph is the internet: a huge network of computers, connected by cables.  Over time, it is easy to imagine this network growing so large that referring to individual computers becomes next to impossible.  Instead, one can probe large collections and ask questions like ""how many labels do I need so that no two connected computers receive the same label?""  This parameter, called the chromatic number of the graph, can change depending upon the complexity of the algorithms allowed to produce the labeling.  Such parameters have (often surprising) connections with other areas of mathematics -- including combinatorial and geometric group theory, probability theory, and operator algebras -- and a secondary aim of this project is to strengthen these connections in addition to forging new ones.<br/><br/>More precise proposed areas of study within this general setting include: (a) existence of measurable vertex colorings, edge colorings, and matchings, and subforests, (b) applications to structurability of measured equivalence relations, in particular those arising as orbit equivalence relations of probability-measure-preserving actions of locally compact Polish groups, (c) applications to finding measurable tilings of group actions, and (d) applications towards characterizing paradoxical decompositions.

Due to their oscillatory motion waves move sediments back and forth and the net transport, averaging over many waves and conditions, is responsible for accretion or erosion of beaches. Shoreward sediment transport is critical to understanding how beaches rebuild in response to rising sea levels, storms, and the construction of engineered coastal structures. Improved understanding of shoreward transport, the focus of this study, will enable better model parameterizations to predict this response and forecast the potential recovery of the coastline following a storm. The fundamental processes underlying wave-driven shoreward transport are among the least understood and most elusive processes in nearshore oceanography. Numerous competing theoretical mechanisms are likely to contribute, but there is a critical lack of validation data to determine their relative importance.  The proposed work is an interdisciplinary collaboration that brings together oceanography, fluid dynamics, and engineering to address the scientific fundamentals of a problem with significant societal implications. Field measurements of turbulence and sediment will be carried out on a natural beach. The experimental data will be combined with advance numerical modelling techniques that will allow identification of the most important wave-driven shoreward mechanisms on a natural beach. Apart for the scientific and engineering values of the study, the project will provide contribute to the training PhD students and it will expose undergraduate students into field research. Public outreach will be conducted through the development of short documentary-style video.<br/><br/>Modeling shoreward transport requires representation of multiple transport processes that act across a broad range of scales, from small-scale turbulence, sediment mobilization, and fluid-sediment feedbacks, to wavelength-scale nonlinear wave processes. In the past, direct investigation of such processes has only been possible in laboratory studies, which have uncertain applicability to real nearshore environments due to scaling effects and simplified dynamics. Full-scale experiments, on the other hand, represent realistic dynamics but often sacrifice resolution, e.g. by only measuring average transport over many wave periods, leaving uncertainty as to what processes are contributing to transport. The key components of this study are the utilization of a purpose-built, broadband pulse-coherent acoustic Doppler profiler (MFDop), and detailed process models, which together resolve the full suite of transport mechanisms that have been hypothesized to occur on natural beaches. The MFDop system is a profiler, capable of measuring sediment concentration and velocity fluctuations at high frequency (50 Hz) and with a vertical resolution of 4 mm capable of resolving the wave boundary layer that extends a few cm above the seabed. The MFDop system and supporting instrumentation will be deployed on a natural beach in Oregon to measure the vertical structure of boundary layer velocities and sediment suspension as a function of the free-stream velocity and pressure gradient. The data collected will guide modeling experiments simulating flow and sediment variability at wavelength and cm-scales (Reynolds-averaged 1-D vertical simulations) and at sub-cm to sub-mm scales capable to resolve boundary layer eddies and sediment particles (Large eddy simulation (LES) modelling). A nested approach will be developed aiming at adding wavelength-effects into LES modelling while avoiding computational limitation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These developments enable a new class of algorithms for Magnetic Resonance Imaging, astronomical imaging, microscopy, and imaging based on X-ray diffractions.  These new algorithms have the potential to drastically reduce the time and expense of scientific and medical data collection for the purpose of imaging.  For example, using these techniques, MRI machines could increase in efficiency, allowing shorter scan times and shorter waits for medical care.  Additionally, these new techniques can accelerate the process of drug discovery and development by minimizing the cost of imaging of molecules.  While some new algorithms have recently appeared, theoretical understanding of them is currently minimal.  This is a serious concern as technology, upon which professionals make scientific discoveries and medical diagnoses, should be reliable in common and novel situations.  The investigator and his colleagues introduce novel approaches for recovering images, scientific and medical, that succeed while needing less data than earlier methods.  Additionally, the investigator and his colleagues provide mathematical justification for why such imaging methods recover a sufficiently high-quality image.  Graduate students are engaged in the research of the project.<br/><br/>The investigator and his colleagues develop a rigorous recovery theory for multiple signal recovery problems in the context of generative neural network priors.  These problems are linear compressed sensing, phase retrieval, and blind deconvolution.  In each, the recovery problem is phrased as a nonconvex optimization under the constraint that the desired signal belongs to the range of a pre-trained generative model given by an artificial neural network.  For each problem, the investigator and his colleagues provide (1) computationally efficient, specific numerical algorithms with convergence guarantees that (2) operate at optimal sample complexity with respect to the dimensionality of the modeled manifold of natural signals, and (3) apply to realistic neural network architectures.  The impact of this work follows from two ideas: (1) generative priors learned from data may provide lower-dimensional representations than sparsity priors in many contexts; and (2) generative priors may be easier to exploit than sparsity priors in nonlinear inverse problems such as phase retrieval.

In reality, the advancement of knowledge across civil engineering disciplines (e.g. environmental, materials, water resources, transportation, structures, geotechnical, construction, computing, or telematics) requires not only an interdisciplinary approach but also the generation of globally-engaged and high-quality civil engineering researchers. In response to these challenges, this collaborative award between ASU and the American Society of Civil Engineers (ASCE) promises to generate large-scale and long-lasting global engagement for a diverse cohort of US graduate civil engineering students through semester-long and world-class research experiences. The design of these research experiences aims at building permanent research collaborations by nurturing a strong personal connection of the students with the international research partner(s) along with knowledge of the cultural and physical contexts in which research occurs. In this project, the US students have access to unique sources of data, facilities, ideas, and networks of acquaintance, and thus will become better prepared to succeed in a competitive research context characterized by pressing global and sustainable issues. By contributing to the generation of a globally-engaged civil engineering workforce with world-class skills, this project contributes to the competitiveness of the US STEM workforce, colleges and universities, and public and private sector industries.<br/><br/>With a 3-year duration, this award enables semester-long and world-class research experiences for a diverse cohort of 75 U.S. civil engineering graduate students at premier research universities located in Australia, China, Colombia, Canada, South Africa, India, and Israel. A significant presence of women and underrepresented minority students creates a diverse student cohort. Specific calls for application are disseminated through channels that can directly reach and engage minorities and disadvantaged students. Each student will remain a fellow for two years from notification of admittance with the aim to secure long-term networks of collaboration and build professional development. A robust professional development focus reinforces the research component in this award. For example, students develop expertise in leadership and ethics through ASU and ASCE's education resources. Students also engage with domestic professional conferences and regional/local meetings while in the US and through equivalent professional societies and industry organizations during their international experience. Additionally, a strong assessment plan will generate empirical data and results that promise to advance the understanding of aspects such as engagement, research, and cultural competence in international research experiences. Finally, this award will promote and disseminate its highlights and outcomes through a combination of academic and non-academic outlets in order to close the gap between academia, industry, and society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, according to Google, an increasing number of attacks on (Android-based) mobile devices are targeting the operating system kernel. For example, 44% of attacks in 2016 targeted the kernel versus 9% and 4% respectively in 2015 and 2014. Unfortunately, contemporary mobile operating systems are large, complex, and full of vulnerabilities; hence they fall victims to these attacks more often than not. This project attempts at improving the state of the art in security of mobile devices through a complementary and comprehensive set of approaches that can alleviate the problem of operating system vulnerability to attacks. This project enhances the security of mobile devices. As mobile devices play an increasingly important role in today's world, this project will have a high impact on global societies and economies. The project will also train students in systems software programming through outreach and tutorial activities. <br/><br/>The project targets three approaches to enhancing the security of mobile devices: (i) a security monitor to provide important security and privacy guarantees despite a compromised operating system, (ii) novel and mobile-specific tools to find (and then fix) mobile operating system vulnerabilities, and (iii) a vetting layer to efficiently safeguard the operating system interface against malicious applications. This project will be conducted in three research thrusts, each of which will address the challenges of one of the aforementioned approaches. The first research thrust builds a trustworthy and extensible security monitor for mobile devices. The key idea in this thrust is the use of security domains, which are isolated domains each hosting a different security service providing a unique security or privacy guarantee. The second research thrust investigates techniques to find vulnerabilities in the mobile operating system. In particular, it investigates solutions to apply existing dynamic analysis techniques to mobile operating system codebase in order to find and patch its vulnerabilities. Most such techniques are only applicable to software running within a virtual machine (VM). Hence, the key idea in this research thrust is to either automatically port mobile operating system code to run within a virtual machine or run these techniques on the device itself. The third research thrust investigates methods to safeguard the operating system interface against malicious applications. It does so by incorporating an extensive set of security checks on system calls and other operating system application programming interface calls to limit the application's attack vector. This thrust consists of two tasks including an in-process shield space capable of securely and efficiently executing the vetting layer's security checks as well as solutions to automatically generate such security checks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This capability has the potential to speed current inspection processes for civil infrastructure and reduce costs by hundreds of millions of dollars annually. An integral part of this project is the inspiration and education of undergraduate and graduate students in the areas of system identification, feedback control, robotics, and structural engineering.

For system identification with mobile sensors, Bayesian inference-based identification and reinforcement learning techniques will be employed to find the future locations of sensors based on the feedback obtained from the current sensor placement. The methodology in this project will also include a path-planning component and a data-fusion component. The path-planning component balances modeling accuracy with energy and time constraints to determine the best candidate locations for data acquisition at each iterative step, while the data-fusion component will determine how to combine prior models with new data as efficiently as possible, considering resource constraints on communication and computation at the mobile sensors.

The investigators will carry out mathematical, statistical and computational analyses of these models to better understand factors affecting the geographical spread of Zika. Several vector-borne diseases (VBDs), such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika, have been imported into Florida, caused local outbreaks (dengue in 2009-2010 and 2013, chikungunya in 2014, Zika in 2016), and posed major public health problems. Dengue, chikungunya and Zika share the same primary mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, both abundant in Florida and capable of transmitting several other diseases. The transmission cycle of these VBDs is heavily influenced by seasonal changes, climate conditions, and human movement. Based on data from 2016 Zika outbreaks in Miami Beach, Wynwood, and Little River in Florida, they will build and calibrate models including the age structure of both hosts and vectors as well as the effects of seasonality to study the spatial and temporal dynamics and spread of Zika in Florida. The objectives are to be better prepared to anticipate and respond to similar reemerging arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses. The project involves graduate students and postdoctoral trainees and results will be disseminated through seminars, conference presentations and journal publications.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are: (i) Since dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses have significant agreement in their spatiotemporal distributions, the PIs will develop a multi-scale (multi-region) multi-patch model to study the geographical spread of VBD. A large scale is used to describe the long distance human movement from regions to regions and a small scale is used to model the short distance movement of both mosquitoes and humans from patches to patches within a region. The model will be applied to simulate the geographical and local spread of Zika among Miami Beach, Wynwood, and Little River in 2016 and will be studied employing multiple scale analysis and slow-fast dynamical system theory. (ii) Since age distributions of both vectors and hosts are very important in the spread of VBD, the PIs will construct age-structured models to study the effect of age distributions of both mosquitoes and humans on the transmission of VBD and use the model to design optimal vector control policies and to access disease risk for different age groups. (iii) Since age-structured models can be written as abstract equations in Banach spaces and seasonality imposes a natural temporal period, the PIs will study the nonlinear dynamics of semilinear periodic equations and apply the results to age-structured VBD models with seasonal change.

The investigators will carry out mathematical, statistical and computational analyses of these models to better understand factors affecting the geographical spread of Zika. Several vector-borne diseases (VBDs), such as dengue, chikungunya and Zika, have been imported into Florida, caused local outbreaks (dengue in 2009-2010 and 2013, chikungunya in 2014, Zika in 2016), and posed major public health problems. Dengue, chikungunya and Zika share the same primary mosquito vectors, Aedes aegypti and Aedes albopictus, both abundant in Florida and capable of transmitting several other diseases. The transmission cycle of these VBDs is heavily influenced by seasonal changes, climate conditions, and human movement. Based on data from 2016 Zika outbreaks in Miami Beach, Wynwood, and Little River in Florida, they will build and calibrate models including the age structure of both hosts and vectors as well as the effects of seasonality to study the spatial and temporal dynamics and spread of Zika in Florida. The objectives are to be better prepared to anticipate and respond to similar reemerging arboviruses such as dengue, chikungunya and yellow fever viruses. The project involves graduate students and postdoctoral trainees and results will be disseminated through seminars, conference presentations and journal publications.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are: (i) Since dengue, chikungunya and Zika viruses have significant agreement in their spatiotemporal distributions, the PIs will develop a multi-scale (multi-region) multi-patch model to study the geographical spread of VBD. A large scale is used to describe the long distance human movement from regions to regions and a small scale is used to model the short distance movement of both mosquitoes and humans from patches to patches within a region. The model will be applied to simulate the geographical and local spread of Zika among Miami Beach, Wynwood, and Little River in 2016 and will be studied employing multiple scale analysis and slow-fast dynamical system theory. (ii) Since age distributions of both vectors and hosts are very important in the spread of VBD, the PIs will construct age-structured models to study the effect of age distributions of both mosquitoes and humans on the transmission of VBD and use the model to design optimal vector control policies and to access disease risk for different age groups. (iii) Since age-structured models can be written as abstract equations in Banach spaces and seasonality imposes a natural temporal period, the PIs will study the nonlinear dynamics of semilinear periodic equations and apply the results to age-structured VBD models with seasonal change. Studying the nonlinear dynamics of periodic solutions in the semilinear periodic Cauchy problem will be transformative since the results will be useful in studying periodic delay equation models, time-periodic reaction-diffusion equations, and age-structured periodic models arising from biology and epidemiology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Music performance is often highly collaborative; musicians harmonize their pitch, coordinate their timing, and reinforce their expressiveness to make music that strikes the hearts of the audience. This research envisions a human-computer collaborative music making system that allows people to collaborate with machines in a manner similar to that in which we collaborate with each other. This is of great significance, as we live in a world where the interaction between humans and machines is becoming deeper and broader, so developing systems that allow us to collaborate with machines is a primary goal of research into cyber-human systems, robotics, and artificial intelligence. Project outcomes will advance the state of the art in automated accompaniment systems by empowering machines with much stronger music perception skills (audio-visual attending to individual parts in ensemble performances vs. monophonic listening), much more expressive music performance skills (expressive audio-visual rendering vs. timing adaptation of audio only), and much deeper understanding of music theory and composition rules (composition and improvisation skills vs. music theory novice). This project will showcase the powerful connection between music and technology, which has inspired generations of great multidisciplinary thinkers such as Pythagoras, Galilei, Da Vinci, and Franklin. The techniques developed in this project will be applied to augmented concert experiences through collaborations with the Eastman School of Music and the Chinese Choral Society of Rochester. Outreach to pre-college and college students will be accomplished through a variety of activities, including lab visits, a summer mini-course on ""music and math"" and teaching and advising in the unique and interdisciplinary Audio and Music Engineering program at the University of Rochester. <br/><br/>The project has four research thrusts with the following expected outcomes: 1) Attending to Human Performances: algorithms for machine listening and visual analysis of multi-instrument polyphonic music performances; 2) Rendering Expressive Machine Performances: computational models for expressiveness and audio-visual rendering techniques for expressive performances; 3) Modeling Music Language for Improvisation: computational models for compositional rules, and algorithms for music generation, harmonization, and improvisation; 4) System Integration: a human-computer collaborative music making system, and a set of design principles backed by subjective evaluations. The research will advance existing interaction mechanisms toward human-computer collaboration. It will also advance the current static-object-displaying type of augmented reality to more intelligent, dynamic and collaborative augmented reality in music performances. The research on audio-visual analysis will advanes both machine listening and visual understanding of audio-visual scenes in the music context. The research on visual rendering of expressive performances will open a new field of computational modeling of visual expressiveness in musical performances. And the research on computational music language models is fundamental for many tasks in music informatics, including transcription, composition, and retrieval. The integration of analysis, performance and music language modeling towards a real-time collaborative system represents a new level of intelligent real-time computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is particularly true for the continental margin off Oregon and Washington State and Southern Canada, which is called the Cascadia Margin. This ~1000 kilometer-long subduction zone fault last ruptured in 1700 which produced a magnitude 9 earthquake that resulted in a large tsunami that impacted the Pacific Northwest and Japan and triggered significant underwater landslides. Gaining access to deep subduction zone fluids, however, is challenging because they are largely inaccessible, occurring at great depth below the seafloor. In 2015, a seep site was discovered off the Oregon coast where a jet of warm, hydrocarbon-enriched, low-salinity fluid was found venting from the seafloor. This site, called Pythia's Oasis, is unlike any seep site yet discovered, providing possible access to fluids formed deep within the Cascadia Subduction Zone. A second adjacent site includes an extensive collapse zone hosting multiple seeps that issue diffuse flows of warm and/or low salinity, methane-rich fluids that support dense microbial and macrofaunal communities. The goal of this research project is to better understand the heat flow around the sites in order to test hypotheses about the origin of these fluids and their effect on the environment. This will be done using a remotely operated vehicle from the National Deep Submergence Facility at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution and heat-flow probes from the Oregon State University, U.S. Academic Heat Flow Capability system. If these fluids come from deep in the subduction zone, this site will provide an opportunity to study high-temperature fluid sources and reactions in the only segment of the Cascadia Subduction Zone that is inferred to be seismically active. Results of the work have implications for understanding deep-seated fluid and seismogenic processes acting in other subduction zones as well. Broader impacts include an at-sea student training program in which at least 10 undergraduate and graduate students will participate on the 13-day sea-going field expedition to the site where they will learn about and participate in seagoing activities and the discovery processes. The students will work alongside experienced scientists and ship and deep submergence vehicle crews to conducting their own research using data collected on the cruise and by later onshore analyses. Public outreach will be carried out via students who will communicate their experiences and findings through a cruise website and formal and informal presentations, with messaging focused on K-20 opportunities in integrated oceanography-engineering programs. <br/><br/>This research will involve collecting heat flow data in and around Pythia's Oasis, a submarine seep on the convergent Cascadia margin, thereby providing a process-based understanding for the thermal and hydrologic regime of the shallow Cascadia subduction zone (CSZ).  Pythia's Oasis is located ~80 km offshore Oregon and approximately 19 km landward of the deformation front.  This seafloor seep has been discharging an enormous flux of warm (11.8 degree C), low salinity (-0.6 PSU), hydrocarbon bearing fluid over a multi-year time scale.  Fluids being discharged there are hypothesized to result from high temperature (> 250 degree C) dehydration reactions that provide a view of deep-seated fluids.  The principal goals of this experiment are to: 1) measure heat flow in the region of Pythia's Oasis, on the incoming plate, across the deformation front, and the accretionary prism, using a violin-bow style marine heat flow probe; 2) link these observations with previously collected values of heat flow (seafloor probe, BSR estimates and continental measurements), along strike and across the forearc; and 3) develop models to better understand the thermal regime of Pythia's Oasis and the Cascadia subduction zone.  The proposed work will address fundamental and long-standing questions about the links between thermal, hydrologic and geodynamic processes and will advance discovery and understanding of this unique seep.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One pernicious type of inaccuracy is an optimism bias, in which preferred outcomes are viewed as more likely than warranted and/or unpreferred outcomes are viewed as less likely than warranted.  Optimism biases lead to problematic individual behaviors like unwise risk taking and over-purchasing, human tragedies like deaths from engineering failures and societally important phenomena like stock market bubbles.  Motivational goals are often assumed to underlie optimism biases but there is an inadequate understanding of when different goals impact optimism, including goals that have the potential to reduce optimism and promote accuracy.  In fact, major theories assume that preferences for outcomes and expectations about the outcomes are independent, which is inconsistent with some empirical findings. The proposed research addresses this discrepancy. The research is structured by a novel Goal-Biased Expectations Framework, which posits contextual features that shape the balance between two orientations that a person can take toward forming expectations.  The balance of orientations ultimately determines whether and how goals shape expectations.  The framework is also useful for developing steps to debias or reduce overoptimism and promote accuracy among professional forecasters and the public.  Debiasing overoptimism can yield improved predictions and ultimately better planning, preparation, and outcomes across many contexts (e.g., financial, health, security).   <br/><br/>Three lines of experiments will be conducted.  One line will examine the scope of, and processes responsible for, a crucial difference in how measures of expectations are affected by outcome desirability or preference.  Past research findings have returned quite different indicators of the extent to which outcome desirability has a biasing influence, but these differences might align with a distinction between two ways in which expectations are commonly solicited in studies and in everyday contexts.  A second line will address how types of available information influence the desirability bias.  One surprising possibility is that as information becomes more clear, people's orientation and goals shift in a manner that produces more bias rather than less. A third line will test a novel debiasing intervention for overoptimism.  Participants in the studies will include sports fans, owners of homes in floodplains, and patients?three groups known to exhibit overoptimism. All of the proposed work will inform the validity of the Goal-Biased Expectations framework. The studies on this grant will involve collaboration with graduate and undergraduate students, and therefore will play important roles in their research training/education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of model theory concerns the ways in which a theory, which is simply a set of sentences in a formal language controls its class of models.  For many years, the PI has concentrated on mechanisms by which a theory can either admit or forbid certain combinatorial configurations in its models, and the proposed research is to continue these investigations in several  disparate contexts.  In some cases, this investigation melds well with computational learning theory.  As one example, if a theory forbids the independence property, then all of the concepts i.e., definable sets, arising in the models of the theory are PAC learnable.<br/><br/>In more detail, potential canonical Scott sentences have proved to be a useful tool in determining the Borel complexity of invariant classes of countable structures and we intend  to streamline these methods by exploring thickness and groundedness of classes of models.  It is hoped that the Borel complexity of every mutually algebraic theory can be computed.  Theories with non-maximal uncountable spectrum are classifiable.  Recent technical results about the existence of prime models make it tractable to settle Vaught's conjecture for classifiable theories and possibly for superstable theories as well.  In first order logic, aleph1-categoricity of a theory is an absolute notion, as can be seen by the Baldwin-Lachlan characterization of aleph1-categoricity.  The PI proposes to determine whether a similar characterization can be found for aleph1-categoricity of sentences of L(omega1, omega), or equivalently for classes of atomic models.  Specifically, the proposed research is to determine whether  aleph1-categoricity is absolute  for classes of atomic models. The PI also proposes to use previous results about mutually algebraic structures to study  expansions of weakly minimal structures that preserve stability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Concrete is the most versatile building material in the United States, used to construct and repair buildings, transportation systems, and energy infrastructure. The development, maintenance, and repair of concrete infrastructure is vital to national growth, prosperity, citizen safety, and welfare. Concrete is a complex, composite material, made of a mixture of mineral aggregates, water, portland cement, and additives that enhance its properties in the initial fluid generated upon mixing and in its final hardened state. Most modern concrete mixtures contain supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs) that partially replace portland cement to improve concrete long-term durability, lower costs, and reduce CO2 emissions associated with concrete production. The most commonly used SCMs are waste-derived, especially residual ashes from coal-fired power plants. However, changes in industrial processes and increasing demand for SCMs are leading to a shortage of high quality, waste-derived SCMs. Natural SCMs, such as calcined clays and volcanic minerals, are a promising alternative to waste-derived SCMs, and their use is rising. Advantages of natural SCMs stem in large part from their chemistry and mineralogy; they are more homogeneous than waste-derived materials, which aids in quality control. Moreover, they also provide economic, environmental, and performance benefits. The use of SCMs, however, also has a downside, i.e., the propensity to increase chemical carbonation reactions between the concrete and atmospheric CO2, which can result in corrosion of steel reinforcement, loss of strength, and cracking. Therefore, it is important to develop a better understanding of the carbonation processes in concrete containing natural SCMs in order to identify materials and mixtures that that impart benefits without sacrificing performance. By combining research expertise and resources between institutions in the United States and the United Kingdom, this project will investigate interactions between concrete containing new and promising sources of natural SCMs and CO2, new methods of testing and damage detection, and new strategies to minimize the impact of the degradation.  This research can lead to the production of higher quality, lower environmental-impact concrete. As such, this research can have a broad impact on the lifespan and sustainability of concrete infrastructure, which is critical for infrastructure globally, sustainability, and workforce development. National prosperity depends on a global, sustainable approach to resource utilization and protection. Students working on this project will gain valuable international research experiences. <br/><br/>Considering that the construction field is increasing its use of natural SCMs in concrete, understanding the contribution of natural SCMs toward carbonation degradation will be critical for the viability of this technology. Furthermore, manipulating the composition of the systems to reduce or prevent carbonation is possible, but has not previously been explored. This Response to CO2 Exposure of Concrete with Natural Supplementary Cementitious Materials (RENACEM) project is a joint United States-United Kingdom collaboration among researchers at the University of Texas at Austin, University of Leeds, and University of Sheffield to elucidate the fundamental science controlling the long-term performance of concrete produced with natural SCMs.  This project will investigate the chemical interactions between concrete and atmospheric CO2 and its transport to identify meaningful methodologies for their assessment. This will underpin the adoption of new methods for testing carbonation of concrete with natural SCMs and new predictive models. RENACEM comprises five work packages (WPs). WP1 will focus on advanced characterization of natural SCMs and the development of materials with reduced carbonation susceptibility.

WP3 will investigate in situ monitoring of pH and relative humidity changes upon CO2 exposure of natural SCM-based concrete using advanced fiber optic sensing networks.

They create the illusion of having multiple physical machines and provide vital support for resource management. Software bugs have proliferated due to the increasing complexity of modern hypervisors; such bugs can cause issues ranging from performance degradation to security vulnerabilities that allow malicious virtual machines to compromise the entire system. This project, IsoV, is to build highly reliable and secure hypervisors through the use of automated verification techniques that effectively eliminate entire classes of software bugs.<br/><br/>IsoV will provide novel programming support for developing hypervisors and for formally verifying their correctness and isolation guarantees. The novelty in the project lies in the ideas behind the push-button approach to hypervisor design. The main idea of push-button verification is to design the interfaces of these systems to be finite and amenable to automated verification. The research goal of IsoV is to develop new designs and techniques for automated verification of hypervisors. This project focuses on two common classes of hypervisors: those that provide isolated execution environments to shield applications from untrusted or buggy operating systems; and those that safely partition resources among mutually distrustful virtual machines. The practical and educational goals of this project are to apply IsoV in building real systems; to release the tools and systems as open-source software; and to disseminate results widely.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research has revealed cybercrime in the cryptocurrency economy, and the rate of fraud has seemed to increase. By understanding the incentives for crime and by modeling effective regulation, this research will make progress towards upending cryptocurrency-based crime. The project will collect data towards understanding how the underlying incentives work to cause fraudulent behavior and how the ecosystem perpetuates fraud. This work aims to influence public policy on cryptocurrencies, making the cryptocurrency ecosystem safer for consumers. The project will train students in this research area and produce course materials.<br/> <br/>The project seeks to correct the information asymmetry in the current cryptocurrency ecosystem, whereby consumers cannot tell the difference between a fraud and a legitimate business. There are two parts to this project. The first part will analyze one particular sector of the ecosystem that seems to be rife with speculation: alternative currencies and the corresponding currency exchanges listing the currencies. Each needs the other to be profitable: currencies need to be listed on an exchange to be worth money, and exchanges need currencies to be listed on them to extract fees from their users executing trades and (often) listing fees for each currency. The second part will collect social network data on cryptocurrency-related services at large in order to learn which services have a high probability of being scams and what indicators are correlated with this. The work will compare the propagation of information about legitimate industries and frauds to work towards differentiating the two. The project will take a longitudinal approach towards modeling how the cryptocurrency ecosystem has evolved into its current state, and it will continue to adapt the models as criminals adapt.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In response, current restructuring practices often include bond reform, which can result in decreases in pretrial incarceration, but also usually leads to increases in other measures of surveillance, such as electronic monitoring, 24-hour curfews, or random drug tests. We know very little about how surveillance practices during the pretrial stage can impact access to political, civil, and social citizenship, although we do know that these practices are stratified by social group. This project studies how people who are released pretrial still experience methods of surveillance and why certain people are more likely to experience harsher measures of surveillance than others.  By better understanding how surveillance influences an accused person's life and who is more acutely impacted by this surveillance, this project will provide insight into how the criminal legal system stratifies citizenship even before an individual is convicted of a crime. Further, findings from this project will inform governmental policy regarding the treatment of accused people who have yet to stand trial.    <br/><br/>This project use two sources of data: ethnographic courtroom observations and in-depth interviews. The project will include six months of courtroom observations  in a large city in order to understand which types of cases result which types of disposition and surveillance in the context of pre-trial release.   The project will also conduct 60 in-depth, semi-structured interviews with people accused of felonies but who are on pretrial release.  Data from these interviews will reveal details regarding pretrial conditions and how these conditions have influenced respondent economic and social statuses, as well as access to political rights.  All data will be analyzed with MaxQDA for two cycles of coding.  The first cycle will focus on open coding and the second cycle will focus on theoretical coding.

Recent years have seen spectacular advances at the intersection of number theory, specifically problems asking how many solutions an equations has, and topology which studies mathematical properties of shapes and spaces. While mathematicians have understood for several decades that individual equations have an associated space whose properties reflect the equation, many natural equations (and many natural spaces) come in infinite sequences.  The last decade has seen spectacular advances (leading in part to Venkatesh's 2018 Fields Medal, highest honor in mathematics) in our understanding of how the asymptotic behavior in natural sequences of equations (""arithmetic statistics"") governs and is governed by the asymptotic behavior in natural sequences of spaces (""homological stability""). This workshop aims to bring together a diverse group of leading and emerging researchers working in number theory, algebraic geometry and topology to obtain a global view of a fast emerging and multidisciplinary area, to train participants in the range of methods available, and to generate a robust problem list that can guide activity in the area for the next 5-10 years. <br/><br/><br/>The last 10 years have brought a burst of activity at the intersection of algebraic topology, number theory and algebraic geometry. This has led to a wealth of:<br/>1) new theorems, such as Ellenberg-Venkatesh-Westerland's proof of the<br/>Cohen-Lenstra heuristics for function fields; <br/>2) new sources of heuristics in topology, such as Vakil-Wood's predictions from the Grothendieck ring, or the notion and coincidences of homological densities as in Farb-Wolfson-Wood; <br/>3) refinements of classical enumerative theorems using modern topological tools, such as Kass-Wickelgren's arithmetic count of the 27 lines on a cubic surface; and<br/>4) a renewed focus on unstable homology, as in Galatius-Kupers-Randal-Williams and Miller-Wilson. <br/>The organizers of the workshop believe that these results are just the beginning of the emerging area of arithmetic topology.

Fundamental understanding of the origins of these deviations is still lacking. This research will employ specialized dielectric, microscopy, and thermal characterization experiments to gain in-depth understanding of the impact of nanoscale confinement and polymer/surface interactions on the bulk properties of polymers of different molecular architectures. A unique focus of this work is the development of new, more accurate experimental methods for probing dynamics at the immediate interface between polymers and solid surfaces. The fundamental understanding obtained from the planned research could provide a basis for deliberate and optimal design of polymers for many technological applications, such as batteries, fuel cells, and supercapacitors, where interfaces play a significant role in determining the overall functionality. In addition, the knowledge gained from this project concerning the impact of the chemistry of solid surfaces in contact with polymers, the type of polymer, extent of confinement and sample preparative conditions will provide fundamental understanding to the polymer science and engineering communities. An important component of this project also involves several integrated educational activities. The project will contribute to training and education of specialists in polymer nanotechnology and materials science through active involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in this research. The integrated research/educational program particularly emphasizes work with underrepresented groups and research experiences for high-school students.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Polymers exhibit deviations from their bulk physical properties in the vicinity of solid interfaces due to changes in interfacial structure and dynamics. These changes lead to shifts in the distribution of microscopic relaxation times determining many physical quantities of polymeric materials relevant to numerous technological fields as adhesion, coatings, and nanocomposites. Predictive understanding of how these alterations in the polymer properties depend on the molecular structure, flexibility of the polymer chains, thickness of the polymer layers, chemistry of the substrates, as well as temperature, is still lacking, and reliable experimental techniques to directly probe the microscopic dynamics in confined polymers are limited. To address this gap, the planned project will employ atomic force microscopy, AC chip calorimetry, and especially broadband dielectric spectroscopy in combination with recently developed nanostructured electrode assembly featuring silica nanostructures and an air gap, to probe interfacial dynamics in model ultrathin polymer films. The main goal of the project is to unravel the impact of interfacial interactions on structural and chain dynamics in linear and architecturally complex polymers, beyond the mean relaxation times. The major objectives include: (i) to develop a fundamental understanding of the influence of solid substrates on dynamics of polymers at interfaces; (ii) elucidate the role of molecular weight, chain flexibility, and architecture on interfacial dynamics; and (iii) investigate the impact of polymer film thickness and temperature on the distribution of relaxation times at the interphases. The detailed fundamental understanding of the impact of one-dimensional confinement gained from this project will provide a scientific framework for the design of novel functional polymers with unique properties for numerous technologies, including coatings, polymer composites, and polymer electrolytes suitable for use in electrochemical power sources and devices.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indeed, quantum-safe primitives will need to be ready and deployed long before the construction of large scale quantum computers to account for the shelf life of encrypted data.

In this CAREER project, Dr. Ryan J. Rafferty at Kansas State University focuses on the design of molecules that can cross biological barriers. Living organisms make use of barriers for defense against foreign substances and to control the transport of chemical substances.  Two examples of such barriers are the blood-brain barrier and the membrane of gram-negative bacteria.  Dr. Rafferty synthesizes molecules that have multiple, different chemical functional groups that influence the transport properties of various species through membranes. The research aims to identify systematic approaches for the design and synthesis of new classes of ""universal"" molecular transporters that can carry other molecules through biological barriers. For example, the new transporters could deliver imaging agents to explore the structure and function of the brain or therapeutic agents into disease-causing bacteria.  The educational plan is designed to lower the barriers to broader participation in STEM fields. Dr. Rafferty uses research topics as examples of real-world applications in undergraduate chemistry classes.  Public outreach is incorporated as a major teaching strategy in a new undergraduate/graduate Chemical Biology course.  The broader outreach plan draws high school students to science through the K-State Annual Chemistry & Physics Symposium and Summer Research Bootcamps.  The general public is engaged in this research through the Flint Hills Discovery Center. <br/><br/>The movement of compounds across the complex biological membranes of gram-negative bacteria and the blood-brain barrier has been shown to be highly dependent upon physicochemical properties of the molecular transporters. However, the effects of individual physicochemical or spatial properties on transport across these barriers have not been systematically studied. The goal of this research project is to develop new chaperone-like small molecules (CLSMs) that facilitate general transport across complex biological barriers. To do so, Dr. Rafferty develops new molecular scaffolds as well new chemical screening libraries to explore single and combinational physicochemical properties.  He also correlates these properties to the transport functions of the new molecules across blood-brain barrier and/or gram-negative bacteria. For example, the new transporters could deliver imaging agents to explore the structure and function of the brain or therapeutic agents into disease-causing bacteria. The research is well suited to the education and training of a diverse group of students and scholars. The Rafferty lab pursues activities that raise the awareness of the public of the value of science and research and that attract new students into the STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To accomplish this, the principle investigator will integrate functionally patterned graphene and graphene derivatives into bioscaffolds to control and measure the fundamental biophysical cues that encode information for human mesenchymal stem cell (hMSC) growth and differentiation. Electrical connections to the graphene bioscaffolds will serve to modulate temperature and electrical fields while also actively monitoring the electrochemical exchange at the cell-graphene interface during growth and differentiation. In order to elucidate graphene's structure-property-processing correlations on hMSC differentiation, genetic profiles will be compared for hMSC growth on epitaxial graphene on SiC substrates, polycrystalline graphene films grown by chemical vapor deposition on copper foils, and graphene films printed from chemically exfoliated graphene nanoflakes. Electrical bias applied to the graphene films will be used to monitor the effect of transmembrane voltage on hMSC fate, as well as the impact of electrical signals on extracellular matrix production and the mechanical properties of engineered musculoskeletal tissue. Intellectual Merit: The fundamental knowledge gained will enable a complete set of design rules for electrically active bioscaffolds that can couple or decouple biophysical cues responsible for stem cell growth and differentiation. The data produced through these experiments will be made publicly available to further advance in silico research of biomolecular processes and subsequent integration in virtual physiological human models. Broader Impacts: By integrating graphene into the tissue engineering cycle, potentially transformational outcomes will likely include new instrumentation for stem cell culture, new multifunctional bioscaffold materials, and new research avenues for tissue engineering and regenerative medicine. Integrated educational outreach activities leverage a local dual-language immersion public charter school and undergraduate service-learning programs to raise awareness about STEM opportunities for English language learners. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/>Stem cells offer the remarkable ability to develop into many different cell types and tissues. Thus, they not only have the potential to cure damaged or diseased organs, but also provide a platform to study the fundamental chemistry of life. Researchers have long studied stem cell biology in vitro with a focus on the impact of biochemical reactions and mechanical cues on stem cell fate. These scientists culture stem cells on various types of materials which serve as bioscaffolds, engineering the materials to leverage the mechanical crosstalk between the stem cell and the scaffold to control their fate. There are few investigations that leverage electrical and thermal cues which vary in space and time to control stem cell fate. The recent discovery of graphene (a single layer of carbon atoms arranged in a 2-dimensional hexagonal crystal structure) has opened up new possibilities for bioscaffolds to control such electrical and thermal interactions with stem cells. Therefore, the goal of this NSF CAREER award is to integrate graphene with stem cell biology to uncover the fundamental interactions of these two systems. Intellectual Merit The proposed work will have an impact on stem cell biology and atomically thin materials research by providing new fundamental insights into the role of electrical and thermal cues in controlling stem cell fate. Broader Impacts: Achieving control over stem cell fate could revolutionize tissue engineering and regenerative medicine, reducing dependence on organ donors to treat patient end-stage organ failure. Scientific outreach activities will help establish a pipeline of English language learners from a local dual-language immersion program into Boise State University's STEM programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI and the co-PI lead ten undergraduates during each of three years in a series of open ended mathematical research projects. Twelve projects are assigned each year, and the investigations result in a refereed research publication in at least half the cases. Participants are selected after a nationwide search, and travel to the Joint Mathematics Meetings each year to present their research. Projects chosen for the students are contemporary; difficult but tractable; of interest to the wider mathematical community; and usually lead to more questions with every new result. Students are required to present their work and they endeavor to publish it. Their introduction to research is thus similar to what they will encounter during the rest of their careers. The students' areas of research are actively investigated by leading researchers supported by NSF. Demographically, students are similar to those at regional schools such as ETSU and UPRP, and reflect the diversity of our nation's mathematical pool: Selected students are least 50% female; at least 40% are from underrepresented groups; at least 40% are first generation college attendees; and at least 50% are from schools with limited undergraduate research opportunities. Students are carefully mentored, and taken ""from a relatively dependent status to as independent a status as their competence warrants"" (NSF 13-542).<br/><br/>Students work on extremal, algebraic, or probabilistic problems in coding theory, combinatorics, or graph theory. Specifically, problems are either in algebraic coding theory, or extremal/probabilistic discrete mathematics. For example, research teams in these two groups work on diverse aspects of algebraic graph constructions, or permutation and word patterns. Students advised by the PI use (a) deep methods in discrete combinatorial probability, and (b) classical combinatorics - in tandem with classical analysis (inequalities, asymptotic analysis etc). The concept of concentration of measure is the intellectual focus of several of these activities. The students advised by the co-PI, on the other hand, are expected to work with linear codes from cutting-edge research. They will work with codes derived from Reed-Solomon codes, Hermitian codes and other codes from algebraic function fields, while others will be expected to find explicit constructions of codes for specific applications. Students might determine good, long codes from graphs and design good encoding and decoding algorithms, or use Grobner bases, finite fields, and polynomials over finite fields in order to find explicit constructions of extremal combinatorial objects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of this explosion of new data, many modern scientific and engineering applications require analysis of and learning on larger datasets and more complex problems than the field has ever considered before.  A major challenge for researchers is to understand how much data, or information, is necessary to solve such complex statistical problems, and given that data, how to most effectively use it to gain insight about the real-world application at hand.  This project explores these questions by developing and analyzing the performance of computationally-efficient algorithms and statistical procedures for these settings.  The research will bring together tools and ideas from information theory, statistical physics, and applied probability to use as a framework for understanding modern, high-dimensional statistics problems and complex machine learning tasks that are core challenges in engineering and data science.  Just as the research in this project is interdisciplinary, so are the educational activities pursued, which focus on making research outcomes accessible to non-experts, increasing opportunities for students from underrepresented communities in computing and data science, and training a new generation of data scientists with multi-disciplinary skillsets and research interests.<br/><br/>This project studies a class of computationally-efficient algorithms, referred to as approximate message passing or AMP, that are used for high-dimensional statistical inference and estimation tasks that underlie many practical applications such as imaging in healthcare and security or building autonomous vehicles using artificial intelligence. Moreover, because AMP allows for exact characterization of its asymptotic performance, such algorithms have been used to establish theory for estimation problems in machine learning and statistics. In many of these applications, AMP outperforms the best competing algorithms in both accuracy and runtime. Drawing on techniques from information theory, signal processing, machine learning, probability, and statistical physics, the goal of the project is to significantly expand and improve the theoretical foundations of AMP algorithms in order to (i) greatly extend the algorithm's capabilities in high-dimensional estimation, (ii) characterize the theoretical properties of the existing AMP algorithms for more general problem settings, and (iii) create new application areas for AMP algorithms and their supporting theory.  The work will lead to the introduction or greater use of AMP in burgeoning fields like machine learning and artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Where congestion occurs, it introduces packet loss, increases network latency, and slows down throughput for individual connections - all of which contribute to poor performance for applications running over the Internet. A close look at congestion can reveal that there are winners and losers on the Internet: when bandwidth becomes a scarce resource, some senders crowd others out, dominating link capacity and harming the performance of other connections. Analyzing these winners and losers becomes challenging because every Internet service is free to independently determine its sending rate, speeding up to consume more bandwidth or slowing down to share the link, according to the parameters of its congestion control algorithm. Examples of common congestion control (CC) algorithms include NewReno, Cubic, Akamai's FastTCP, and Google's BBR.<br/><br/>This proposal aims to understand the state of fair bandwidth allocation given the heterogenous congestion control algorithms in use today. Our project goal is twofold: (1) to measure what CC algorithms are in use 'in the wild' today; and (2) to evaluate each algorithm in controlled experiments in contention with other algorithms. To achieve (1), we will design and implement new techniques to identify and characterize the CC in use for arbitrary Internet services (even when we cannot control the service ourselves). To achieve (2), we propose new frameworks to conduct scientific evaluation of fairness and, where possible, combine our fairness measurements with mathematical models describing our results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

AI technology is now successfully being used in voice assistants, photo recognition technology, chatbots, search engines, and self-driving cars. While current AI is very good at matching specific patterns for specific tasks, research has shown that it cannot generalize to different tasks and has no real understanding of what it is doing.  Thus, radical new directions need to be explored to achieve a truly intelligent machine.  This project explores a new kind of AI framework, one that mimics how the human brain senses and understands the world.  This new AI system learns much like an infant would, by simply observing the world and learning through exploration.  This project also utilizes a new type of computer chip that communicates information in the same way that neurons in the brain communicate.  Ultimately, the project will create a new kind of AI by mimicking certain functions of the human brain.  This research can inform new methods and approaches to creating an AI that better understands the world in which we live.  Furthermore, the project attracts and supports the education of students interested in the interdisciplinary field of human and machine intelligence.<br/><br/>This project develops a new multimodal machine learning paradigm that is principally different from the traditional deep learning methods used in the state-of-the-art today.  This research is inspired by breakthroughs in computational and theoretical neuroscience that incorporate ideas not explored by current feed-forward deep learning architectures. Rather than using massive labeled datasets, the algorithms learn much like an infant learns, i.e., by unsupervised observation and exploration of the world through different sensory inputs. The project addresses three primary research challenges: (1) the algorithms will robustly learn the structure of the world, (2) the model will learn heterogenous associations from repeated stimuli, and (3) given the same fundamental architecture, the model will learn how to predict the future.   Furthermore, the framework described in the project mimics the hierarchical architecture, sparsity, top-down, and feedback functions of the mammalian brain. This model is built upon recent advances in neuromorphic software and hardware that enhance the functionality, energy use, and speed of the underlying algorithms. Given that neuromorphic approaches are under active development, this project has the unique opportunity to provide algorithms and functionality in software and silicon.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Intelligent systems that make predictions of sentence specificity have been useful for natural language processing tasks such as summarization and argumentation mining, as well as for linguistic analyses in fields such as forensic science, political science, and education. However, existing systems are domain-specific tools that operate only on the sentence level. This project addresses a series of challenges to enable domain-agnostic, multi-level analysis of specificity, bringing together concepts across computational methods, linguistic analysis and corpora development. It opens up venues of applying specificity as a pragmatic tool in a wide range of disciplines, including those where the use of computational methods is rapidly emerging. <br/><br/>To substantially advance our understanding and practical use of text specificity to capture information organization in discourse, this CISE Research Initiation Initiative (CRII) project aims to (1) develop effective specificity prediction systems that work across multiple domains, (2) develop annotation guidelines and datasets to capture specificity in a nuanced way, (3) develop techniques to predict specificity from multiple levels of linguistic analysis (words, phrases and sentences). Throughout these tasks, the project draws connections between specificity variations in text, their pragmatic functions, and their impact on discourse structure.

This proposal specifically responds to a national and local shortage in qualified and certified mathematics teachers. Over the five-year duration of the award, the project aims to produce 27 new, certified mathematics teachers who will teach in high-need school districts in West Texas. The work will be done by a partnership that includes Texas Tech University, two community colleges (South Plains College and Midland College), and the Lubbock Independent School District.   The project will recruit first- and second-year undergraduates and provide them with an early teaching experience through work as Learning Assistants in college-level math classes. By providing the learning assistant with financial support, near-peer mentoring, and direct classroom experience, This recruitment strategy is expected to encourage students to pursue a career in secondary mathematics teaching.<br/> <br/>The goals of this project are to: 1) Attract high quality, diverse, STEM undergraduate students to complete a Bachelor of Science in Multi-Disciplinary Studies degree with secondary mathematics certification; 2) Create a pathway for community college students to earn a STEM degree and teacher certification in mathematics and a career in middle school or high school teaching; 3) Prepare self-determined mathematics teachers who have a high degree of both content and pedagogical knowledge, 4) Retain 27 recipients as mathematics teachers; and 5) Augment research and tracking activities of recipients.   In Stage I of this project, undergraduate students will be recruited from the two community colleges and Texas Tech University to serve as learning assistants who will support a STEM classroom under the direct supervision of a teacher or faculty member.   In Stage II, those students who determine to pursue a teaching career will be invited to apply for a Noyce scholarship and complete the multidisciplinary studies degree. A self-determination rubric, which was developed through prior awards, and specific application criteria (e.g., GPA) will be used to inform Scholar selection.   As part of Stage II, this project will use successful activities from prior Noyce awards, including a mentorship model, the self-determination framework, and a scholarship seminar. The project evaluation plan includes the use of the self-determination rubric, student demographics, student surveys, document analysis, performance tracking and persistency tracking. The research methodology will be an outcomes comparison between participants and non-participants. Each of the research questions will be examined through a participant profile analysis, descriptive qualitative comparisons, and a Multiple Level Analysis of Variance (MANOVA) on performance outcomes. This project may benefit the nation by developing a better understanding of how to recruit and retain highly-qualified mathematics teachers and attract them to teach in high-need school districts. More immediately, this project should help to fill the vacant positions in mathematics teaching in local schools. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Manufacturing is the largest workforce sector in North Iowa.  A spring 2018 survey of 30 regional manufacturers confirmed the general need for more industrial technicians.  In addition, respondents indicated a strong need for technicians with robotics education. Because of the combined issues of too few workers and the need for technicians with robotics education, employers are struggling to meet production demands. This project will use strategies to broaden the pipeline into the courses that will best support the burgeoning need for robotics-savvy technicians. The region and the college have a high proportion of first-generation low-income students.  Thus, this project's focus on robotics may help many individuals with financial need move more quickly into high paying jobs. The project aims to develop educational pathways to broaden access to robotics education for populations including veterans, high school dual enrollment students, students on the college campus, and incumbent workers. This project may provide a model for other community colleges and their industry partners about how to incorporate advanced robots into manufacturing technician preparation.  As a result, the project has the potential to contribute to improving the national STEM workforce.<br/><br/>The inclusion of robotics will allow the college to offer instruction in more advanced levels of industrial technology. An introductory robotics class for Industrial Mechanics and Maintenance and Industrial Systems Technology students will address industry need and also support college recruiting, which is key to providing more industrial technician graduates to regional employers. The course will embed a newly-developed stackable credential from the National Coalition of Certification Centers (NC3) and the college will uniquely enhance the credential by adding lab courses that feature state-of-the-art robots. This project will enable the college to recruit and educate more industrial technicians, with a plan to double the number of graduates in the Industrial Mechanics and Maintenance and Industrial Systems Technology programs and introduce new robotics training to these students. To these ends, the project focuses on: 1) adding state-of-the-art robotics equipment and training faculty in the new robotics technology; 2) training and credentialing all Mechanics and Maintenance and Industrial Systems Technology students using a new Introduction to Robotics course that will include hands-on robotics labs and NC3 Level 1: Fundamentals Robotics coursework and robotics credentialing; 3) creating and implementing demonstration projects for both educational and recruiting purposes to expand the pathway into the college Mechanics and Maintenance and Industrial Systems Technology programs; and 4) training and credentialing incumbent workers using the Introduction to Robotics course with the NC3 robotics credential. The use of this curricular model is based on results of previous research and draws on the experience of closely-related NSF-funded projects.  This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because the notion of a set is among the most primitive in mathematics, it was used as the basic fabric with which to build the more complicated objects of mathematics. Since that time, it has been realized that the properties of infinite sets are themselves quite subtle and defy a complete axiomatization. Moreover, these set-theoretic complexities sometimes manifest themselves in more complex mathematical structures, such as those studied in algebra, analysis, and geometry. The aim of this project is to further develop both our understanding of set-theoretic methods and also how they can be applied to problems arising in fields of mathematics such as algebra, analysis, and topology. While the project involves several lines of investigation, a central theme will be to develop a deeper understanding of the structure of the algebra of all piece-wise linear functions from the unit interval to itself using the lens of transfinite ordinal numbers.<br/><br/>The first part of the research project involves attempting to prove the following conjecture of Matthew Brin and Mark Sapir: if G is a group of piece-wise linear homeomorphims of the unit interval, then either G is elementary amenable or else G contains an isomorphic copy of Richard Thompson's group F. It is the PI's thesis that not only is this conjecture true, but that it will be a consequence of a much finer analysis of subgroup structure of PLoI, the group of piece-wise linear homeomophisms of the unit interval. This analysis is expected to have a number of other consequences: that the finitely generated subgroups of F are well quasi-ordered by embeddability; that any finitely presented subgroup of PLoI is either abelian or contains a copy of F; that Peano Arithmetic does not prove that F is amenable. Central to the analysis will be the countable transfinite ordinals. The second part of the research project concerns further developing techniques in pure set theory: <br/>methods for studying the combinatorics of the second uncountable cardinal via forcing axioms; the role that Jensen's diamond principle plays in the theory of the sets of hereditary cardinality at most aleph1.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the molecular scale, GO can be described as a sheet of carbon atoms linked together, with oxygen atoms attached to carbon atoms in a few places. The sheet-like structure of GO is similar to graphite, another carbon material which is used in lubricants and pencil leads. The ""slipperiness"" of graphite derives from the tiny sheets of carbon material sliding past each other. Professor Kumar's interest in GO is not for its lubrication abilities, but because it can be used to adsorb other molecules and ions (for example impurities in water), or be used in other technologies like batteries, fuel cells and catalysts. An interesting feature of GO is that its chemical properties are ""tunable.""  That is, by varying the number of oxygen atoms attached to the carbon sheet, different reactivities result. Professor Kumar and her students are developing computer models to simulate the properties and behavior of various kinds of GO, and their interactions with different molecules and liquids.  Graduate and undergraduate students working on this project are being trained in theoretical and computational chemistry ranging from fundamental concepts in statistical mechanics and quantum mechanics to computational algorithms and modeling. Professor Kumar develops molecular simulation modules as part of the undergraduate physical chemistry curriculum at her university. This course provides a basis for her international course on computational methods targeting graduate students and postdoctoral students to help them understand the state-of-the-art computational methods used in the field.  Professor Kumar is also involved in K-12 science activities such as Super Science Saturday and Martin Luther King, Jr. Day initiatives. She develops ""Fun with molecules"", a series of presentations and hands-on learning modules for high school and middle school students that introduce underrepresented minority students to STEM careers. <br/><br/>This project focuses on chemical reactivity and dynamics at solid-liquid interfaces. Graphene oxide (GO) is model surface system because it contains both hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains. This nano-scale heterogeneity leads to asymmetrical solvation environments, and a general condition where chemical adsorption and reactivity differ from one interfacial site to the next. The oxygen content of GO can be varied over a wide range, making GO a ""tunable"" material. This project uses computational molecular dynamics tools to explore the effect of oxygen content on interfacial structural and dynamical heterogeneity. Three specific themes that are critical for GO-based technologies are being explored, namely, the competition between hydrophobic and hydrophilic domains on solvation environment and dynamics, reactivity at these interfaces, and structuring at the electrode-electrolyte interface. The development of accurate yet efficient many-body, all atom force-fields as well as molecular interpretations of experimental data are key aspects of this project. Reactive force-fields based on the chemically intuitive empirical valence bond approach to model acid-base reactivity of GO membranes are also being developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As module deployment expands rapidly, so will module wastes. The International Renewable Energy Agency estimates that end-of-life modules will total 78 million metric tons by 2050. With a successful project, the proposed recycling technology will become technically scalable, financially profitable, and environmentally sustainable for terawatt-scale deployment of silicon modules. The project lays down the technical foundation for a new recycling industry projected to be worth billions of dollars by 2050. <br/><br/>The investigators have already  demonstrated a two-step recycling process to extract all the valuable, bulky, and toxic materials from silicon modules including solar-grade silicon, silver, aluminum, glass, lead, copper, and tin. In this project, the researchers will: 1) develop a more simplified recycling process than the one already demonstrated; 2) improve the silver recovery rate to over 95%; 3) identify a low-cost anode for metal recovery by electrowinning; 4) verify that the recovered silicon meets the specifications of solar-grade silicon; 5) modify the recycling process for new commercial silicon solar cells; 6) explore a solar module backsheet reclamation process, and 7) dissolve the ethylene vinyl acetate layer in sodium hydroxide. What differentiates the proposed recycling technology is that it maximizes the revenue from recycling by recovering all the valuable, bulky, and toxic materials in silicon modules. These materials are raw materials to the solar industry worth $12.43/module today. The current recycling process recovers only the bulky materials worth $3.42/module, which is far below the actual cost of recycling. The proposed technology is targeted to enable profitable recycling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to their high economic impact and low technical complexity, such attacks remain one of the most problematic and common attacks experienced by companies, organizations, and high-profile individuals.  This research project explores the viability of mitigating the effects of a distributed denial of service attack by dynamically adjusting the path traffic takes through the Internet, causing it avoid links congested with attack traffic.  This technique has a number of advantages over currently deployed techniques which are both costly and, in many instances, ineffective.  The research in this project additionally helps scientists more broadly understand how the Internet responds to on-demand re-routing of traffic.  The final product of this research is functional prototype systems that are capable of ensuring that victims of a distributed denial of service attack can still communicate over the Internet, while at the same time being inexpensive and deployable on the existing Internet infrastructure. The project will train students in research as well as distribute software prototypes for the network operator community to use. It will also spend efforts to transition research to practice.  The adoption of such systems would help companies avoid the financial harm that comes from distributed denial of service attacks and secure critical infrastructures, for example Smart Grids and national defense communications, from such attacks.<br/><br/>This research project expands our knowledge of how re-routing based DDoS attack mitigation systems would function in practice.  The experiments being conducted explore three key areas necessary for viable deployment of such systems.  First, the research would validate the feasibility of re-routing as a security primitive on the live Internet.  To explore this, researchers are attempting to execute re-routing policy on the Internet for their own network, observing from diverse vantage points the impact on path selection.  These experiments quantify the prevalence of policies that inhibit the ability to migrate traffic, the number of alternative paths available in practice, and the independence of those paths.  Second, researchers are exploring the viability of multiple actors successfully utilizing re-routing simultaneously.  Researchers are developing algorithms that both compute the maximal amount of re-routing the Internet infrastructure can support and allocate those resources to make the most efficient use of this capacity.  Lastly, researchers are enhancing re-routing based mitigation to function against dynamic adversaries.  By considering the capacity of adversaries to also re-route their malicious traffic, researchers are building alternative path selection strategies that minimize the ability of the adversary to violate traffic isolation, and at the same time are exploring the viability of using a moving target defensive strategy through continuously re-routing critical traffic.  This project results in functional software prototypes of a re-routing based distributed denial of service mitigation system that are freely supplied to the networking operator community for their use.  Researchers are facilitating the system's transition to practice (TTP) by reaching out to the network operator community, both educating them on the possibilities of such solutions and as well as receiving feedback and suggestions for future enhancement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One pernicious type of inaccuracy is an optimism bias, in which preferred outcomes are viewed as more likely than warranted and/or unpreferred outcomes are viewed as less likely than warranted.  Optimism biases lead to problematic individual behaviors like unwise risk taking and over-purchasing, human tragedies like deaths from engineering failures and societally important phenomena like stock market bubbles.  Motivational goals are often assumed to underlie optimism biases but there is an inadequate understanding of when different goals impact optimism, including goals that have the potential to reduce optimism and promote accuracy.  In fact, major theories assume that preferences for outcomes and expectations about the outcomes are independent, which is inconsistent with some empirical findings. The proposed research addresses this discrepancy. The research is structured by a novel Goal-Biased Expectations Framework, which posits contextual features that shape the balance between two orientations that a person can take toward forming expectations.  The balance of orientations ultimately determines whether and how goals shape expectations.  The framework is also useful for developing steps to debias or reduce overoptimism and promote accuracy among professional forecasters and the public.  Debiasing overoptimism can yield improved predictions and ultimately better planning, preparation, and outcomes across many contexts (e.g., financial, health, security).   <br/><br/>Three lines of experiments will be conducted.  One line will examine the scope of, and processes responsible for, a crucial difference in how measures of expectations are affected by outcome desirability or preference.  Past research findings have returned quite different indicators of the extent to which outcome desirability has a biasing influence, but these differences might align with a distinction between two ways in which expectations are commonly solicited in studies and in everyday contexts.  A second line will address how types of available information influence the desirability bias.  One surprising possibility is that as information becomes more clear, people's orientation and goals shift in a manner that produces more bias rather than less. A third line will test a novel debiasing intervention for overoptimism.  Participants in the studies will include sports fans, owners of homes in floodplains, and patients?three groups known to exhibit overoptimism. All of the proposed work will inform the validity of the Goal-Biased Expectations framework. The studies on this grant will involve collaboration with graduate and undergraduate students, and therefore will play important roles in their research training/education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Seismic data record elastic wavefields propagating through the solid Earth, while acoustic data record acoustic wavefields propagating through the fluid atmosphere. Collectively, seismic and acoustic (seismo-acoustic) signals recorded before, during, and after eruptions inform our understanding of how volcanoes work and enable volcano monitoring scientists to forecast and assess eruptions. Seismic data currently form the backbone of most volcano-monitoring systems. Seismic signals at erupting volcanoes capture magma transport and rapid depressurization associated with explosive eruptions. Infrasound, acoustic waves with frequencies below 20 Hz, the lower-frequency limit of human hearing, is a newer technology, and provide accurate constraints on the timing and duration of explosive eruptive activity. Infrasound from major explosive eruptions can propagate for thousands of kilometers in atmospheric waveguides and infrasound sensor networks are sometimes the only ground-based technology to record an explosive eruption. This project supports a 5-year comprehensive research program on the source, propagation, and remote detection and quantification of the seismo-acoustic signatures of volcanic unrest and eruption. This research program will be integrated with a range of undergraduate and graduate educational activities at the Department of Earth Science, University of California, Santa Barbara.<br/><br/>This project will collect next-generation, multi-parametric, seismo-acoustic field data from active volcanoes in Vanuatu, Mexico, and Chile at local (<15 km), regional (15-250 km), and remote (>250 km) distances from the source. In tandem, the lead researcher will develop an array of computationally intensive data processing methodologies and modeling and inversion strategies to systematically mine large volcano seismo-acoustic datasets and test multiple scientific hypotheses about the source and propagation of these wavefields. Specifically, he will investigate: (1) Acoustic source directivity of volcanic explosions; (2) Seismo-acoustic wave partitioning, conversion, and coupling; (3) Non-linear infrasound propagation; (4) The influence of topography and atmospheric structure (primarily wind and temperature) on linear and non-linear infrasound propagation from volcanic explosions; and (5) the capability of regional and remote infrasound and seismic networks to detect, locate, characterize, and catalog explosive eruptions. This work has the potential to dramatically advance the field of volcano seismo-acoustics, bridging the gap between local and regional to global scale studies. The Vanuatu field deployments will combine ground-based broadband seismic and infrasonic networks with multiple novel airborne infrasound tethered-balloon (aerostat) acquisition systems together with 3D aerial (drone) imaging and other multi-parametic data. Each geophysics field experiment team will include up to five undergraduates and two graduate students from UC Santa Barbara. The experiments will involve significant international collaboration with multiple researchers and graduate students from the US, New Zealand, Vanuatu, Mexico, and Chile. In the field, they will collect geo-referenced video data from novel 360 degree, virtual reality capable cameras, unmanned aerial vehicles, and other systems, allowing the creation of a rich immersive material for virtual field trip exercises that will share the excitement of volcano geophysics fieldwork and scientific discovery to General Education undergraduate students at UC Santa Barbara and elsewhere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Economic losses from extreme weather disasters are spatially concentrated in states like Florida and are remarkably stable over time. While there are many reasons that people stay in disaster-prone areas, others choose to migrate or are forced to leave, some temporarily and others permanently. As economic actors, migrants take with them myriad economic activities that constitute economic losses that have not been studied in previous research. This project will be the first to document the size of economic losses via migration from affected areas in the U.S. after extreme weather events. Because migration necessarily connects places to one another, the project will also document whether and to what extent such economic losses via migration contribute to changing spatial inequality in the U.S. as a whole. Project results will provide input into policies concerning how to mitigate the economic costs of extreme weather disasters in the U.S., thus contributing to disaster recovery and economic prosperity.<br/> <br/>This project uses county-level data from the Statistics of Income program at the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) and the Federal Reserve Bank of New York Consumer Credit Panel (CCP) to document and analyze economic losses via migration from affected areas after extreme weather disasters in the U.S. over the past two decades. Total economic losses via migration are measured in the IRS and CCP data using information on aggregate adjusted gross income and debt-financed consumption activities, respectively. After summarizing the size of economic losses via migration from affected areas after extreme weather disasters, the project will use demographic decomposition procedures to distinguish the relative contributions of economic components (average, or per capita, economic losses via migration) and demographic components (the propensity to migrate, as well as population size in the affected area). Further acknowledging the inherently spatial character of migration, this project also documents whether and to what extent economic losses via migration from affected areas after extreme weather disasters contribute to changing spatial inequality in the U.S. using two variants of the Gini Index that measure spatial focusing among flows in migration networks. Given heterogeneity in the relationship between extreme weather disasters and migration, this project takes a case-specific and comparative approach, focusing on three types of extreme weather disasters, including tropical cyclones, tornadoes, and wildfires, in counties that have experienced the bulk of economic losses over the last twenty years according to the Spatial Hazards Events and Losses Database for the United States (SHELDUS).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent decades, however, USA STEM research productivity has plateaued despite increases in federal research funding, leading to questions of how to maximize productivity in the STEM academic research workforce beyond financial means. The objective of this project is to investigate the role of motivation in STEM higher education faculty research productivity and development. Motivated faculty are expected to be more productive and stay in the higher education workforce, particularly if they are from populations traditionally underrepresented in the STEM research workforce. Results of the current project will inform higher education institutions, particularly universities striving to increase scholarly productivity, as to specific strengths and deficits in STEM faculty motivation that relate to measurable gains in research productivity. This is a critical step toward designing research development interventions from university-based induction programs to NSF training grants aimed at bolstering motivation to enhance the productivity of STEM faculty researchers. Findings will provide guidance to universities on best practices and policies for supporting STEM faculty in producing innovative basic and applied scientific knowledge, tackling key social and economic challenges with their research, and training the next generation of flexible, knowledgeable, and diverse STEM researchers. This project is jointly funded by the Science of Science Innovation and Policy Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research. <br/><br/>This multi-institution project will be the first to pair STEM faculty psychological surveys responses with bibliometric indicators of research productivity (publications, citations, social media attention). These data will be used to test a conceptual model hypothesizing how faculty characteristics (demographic, employment) and institutional qualities (research resources, social-environmental factors) relate to motivational variables (autonomy, competence, relatedness, interest, control, value, self-regulation, grit) that, if supported, should yield optimal intrinsic motivation and positive emotions, and result in enhanced research productivity (e.g., bibliometric, self-report). Structural equation modeling will be used to analyze the posited relationships cross-sectionally and predict the development of STEM faculty researchers longitudinally over a three-year period. Additionally, the project will examine hypothesized relationships among traditionally underrepresented groups in STEM fields based on gender, race, and ethnicity. This research will improve our understanding of the STEM higher education research workforce in several ways. First, this project represents the first interdisciplinary study pairing faculty survey data with independent, bibliometric indicators of research productivity. Second, these studies will utilize reliable and valid measures of variables relating to faculty research outcomes and evaluate the generalizability of the hypothesized model in a large USA sample of ~1,400 faculty across 10 higher education institutions. Third, this research will expand upon limited empirical findings investigating psychological variables associated with faculty research productivity and development, and explore the interplay with faculty characteristics (e.g., underrepresented minority groups in STEM) and institutional qualities. Fourth, the project will utilize established motivation theories rarely applied to faculty research productivity and development to generate new knowledge and best practices in this under-examined domain. As such, the current project will guide the establishment of critical variables and benchmarks for STEM faculty motivation to predict research productivity and development over time.

To realize the beneficial societal outcomes on, for example, interactions between humans and intelligent robots, it is important to develop simulations to test a variety of situations where memory under arousal states will function. In this project, the investigator articulates a research plan to use a simulation of the human mind and body to understand effects of physiological arousal on human memory and cognition and the consequences for human interaction with AI agents. Human-subject studies will be used to introduce stimuli to induce human arousal by using selected stressors and collect physiological and behavioral data during tasks that require cooperation between humans and AI agents. Societal benefits include an architecture to simulate a variety of human-AI interactions under various levels of arousal and stress. This architecture can be used to explore new ways to co-team humans with AI agents and set expectations for positive and/or negative behaviors that might occur in such collaborations. Undergraduate students at Bucknell University will be heavily involved as research assistants on this project. <br/><br/>The investigator plans to develop simulations and elicit arousal states in human operators performing collaborative tasks with agents enabled by artificial intelligence (AI) to understand human-AI interaction. The goal is to better understand, through simulation, how algorithms for intelligent agents can be advanced and expanded to respond to human variations in behavior and memory processes under different levels of arousal, including levels that mimic stress.  The objectives include developing simulations to examine contexts and tasks; understanding how environmental stimuli affect interactions between humans and intelligent agents; and determining how to advance algorithms to optimize human-AI cooperation and avoid maladaptive interactions. The investigator has already extended Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational (ACT-R) architecture to account for physiological influences on declarative and procedural memory. Physio-cognitive agents will be developed based on Bayesian and reinforcement learning to acquire knowledge of their environment. Human-AI task simulations will be implemented in a virtual environment to understand how arousal mediates intelligent behavior and how interaction with external environments that include AI agents may change performance, including through maladaptive behavior. The project seeks to discover computationally-enabled processes and contexts to amplify human capabilities. The resulting revised models and open-source code will be made available to the public for further explorations in human-AI interaction.

However, many undergraduate students still do not become directly acquainted with polymer science/engineering prior to graduation.  An earlier introduction to polymer science research and applications can help ignite innovations that address some of the emerging challenges of national interest such as energy efficiency, green chemistry, and improved healthcare.  Due to the interdisciplinary nature required within polymer science and engineering, the research opportunities within this REU Site will provide a diverse cohort of students with a broader perspective of techniques and problem solving approaches, as well as a deeper and more rigorous appreciation of future careers in research.  An interdisciplinary team of faculty mentors has been assembled to help prepare a rich pipeline of young engineers that can contribute to current and emerging engineering challenges.<br/><br/>This REU program is expected to yield many tangential outcomes beyond the direct technical impacts to the fields of polymer chemistry, material science, and engineering. First, acquiring fundamental knowledge of polymer chemistry will help leverage it to novel discovery of innovative solutions and will open up a variety of PhD-level research opportunities to the REU students in the future. Also, hands-on exposure to the various interdisciplinary projects will improve the students' ability to communicate to a broader community of researchers and the general public. This is particularly important training to help nurture them into future leaders and educators in science and engineering. This program will also educate the students about technology-transfer issues, entrepreneurship, polymer-based research applications in the private sector, and the leadership skills needed for long-term success by direct interaction with experts and young alumni working in the field. All of these impacts will be magnified with a special focus to recruit students from HBCUs and Hispanic-serving community colleges that are traditionally underrepresented or have limited access to resources.<br/><br/>This site is supported by the Department of Defense in partnership with the NSF REU program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When strategic individuals have privacy concerns about the use of their data, they may modify their behavior to ensure less, or perhaps more favorable, information is revealed.  The project's novelties are an interdisciplinary approach, which combines tools from algorithm design, machine learning, and economics. The broader significance and importance of this work is to provide a critical step for society's ability to collect useful data and to interpret data via existing algorithms. As more personal data are collected, stored, and used in algorithmic decision making, these results are useful in the legal and policy landscape of personal data management. <br/><br/>This work has two main technical thrusts.  First, this project studies how privacy technologies can be designed and deployed to manage privacy concerns of strategic individuals. This yields insight into the design of optimal privacy technologies for strategic individuals in practical application areas.

From hardened steel in the industrial revolution to the doped silicon used in the electronics era, new ways to understand and control materials often leads to new technology. In a physics perspective, materials are generally made of densely packed atoms with positively charged ionic cores permeated by a negatively charged gas of electrons.  We know the movement of electrons and ions is governed by quantum mechanics.  However, understanding exactly how this motion gives rise to material properties such as superconductivity and exotic forms of magnetism is a major challenge.  This is challenging, in part, because it is difficult to observe individual electrons.  They are small; they move quickly; they interact with each other, and they are easily disturbed.  To address this challenge with a new approach, this project aims to use gasses of ultracold molecules in vacuum to simulate electrons in materials.  Interactions between molecules are expected to make phenomena such as the self-organization of crystalline phases easier to observe.  This team will assemble polar molecules atom-by-atom at ultracold temperatures and then trap molecules in a thin sheet of laser light.  While confined in one dimension, the molecules will still be free to move in two dimensions and interact with each other. This project will explore how to use this quantum mechanical ""fabric"" of dipolar molecules to simulate properties of real materials and to study fundamental organizing principles of matter.<br/><br/>The team will construct a new apparatus to study two-dimensional quantum systems of ultracold dipolar molecules. The objectives include (1) the creation of a novel quantum gas mixture of sodium and cesium atoms. (2) The creation of dense ultracold samples of sodium-cesium molecules in the absolute ground state. (3) The investigation of molecular gases in a single two-dimensional sheet via high-resolution imaging. Sodium-cesium molecules have a large electric dipole moment (the largest among the chemically stable bialkali molecules). Utilizing the molecules' dipole moment, this team aims to explore parameter regimes that were inaccessible so far, and which may enable the observation of novel many-body quantum phases such as strongly correlated superfluidity, supersolidity, and the formation of a dipolar crystal. In addition to the technical effort, the project is accompanied by a broad outreach program that aims to improve literacy in quantum physics among high school students, undergraduate students, and high school science teachers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As mathematics education research strives to understand historic inequities in mathematics for Black learners, small-scale research has described the relationships between identity, subjectivity, and positionality in Black learners as it relates to their achievement and interest in mathematics. This study builds on that descriptive work by seeking to describe trajectories that describe the ways in which Black learners develop as particular kinds of mathematical learners.  The study takes place in the context of an established, multi-year college bridge program that has as its goals to increase the representation of historically marginalized groups in the university community.  Students in the bridge program from three communities in the greater Detroit area with strong academic achievement in mathematics will be recruited. Their experiences in the bridge program will be traced to identify trajectories that describe the development of Black learners relative to mathematics, and document the design features of classroom activities that support learners in moving through those trajectories. <br/><br/>At the center of the project is the study of cohorts of students in grades 8-11 as they move through the summer bridge program. The bridge project's current curriculum features a series of lessons focused on identity development related to mathematics.  These lessons will be implemented, studied, revised, and redeployed across the duration of the project across the summer sessions. Teacher focus groups and surveys will assess the implementation of the activities and aggregate feedback on the design. Three cohorts of students will be recruited to participate in the broader project activities from three metro areas with distinctly different demographic profiles.  Student mathematical efficacy will be assessed for all participating students. Within each of the three metro areas, students will be recruited that represent differing levels of mathematics efficacy to ensure that focus students are likely to experience different trajectories through their engagement with the study. The students will be interviewed three times in each academic year to describe their trajectories. Student achievement data will also be collected for all participating students along with narrative descriptions and autobiographies about the messages students receive about mathematics. These messages include their own internal thinking about how they see themselves as mathematics learners, and messages that are sent to them by other students, teachers, and the community. Products of the study will be case studies that describe trajectories of identity development in Black mathematics learners, and a disseminated curriculum for a mathematics identity-focused bridge program supporting Black learners.<br/><br/>This is a Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) proposal awarded under the Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) program.

In essence, appropriately designed artificial neural networks are shown large quantities of labeled data-points, allowing their internal parameters to be continually adjusted or 'learned'. Despite its apparent simplicity, such neural networks require certain regularities in the input data domain in order to become effective, which limits its application to areas beyond those described above. For example, in natural images, pixels are arranged into regular squared grids, whereas text and speech contains samples sequentially aligned. This project aims at overcoming this important limitation, by allowing neural networks to operate on far more general data domains, such as chemical compounds or social networks. Its research outcomes have the potential to impact a broad range of technological areas currently limited by lack of appropriate end-to-end learning systems and/or computational scalability. Besides the prospect of significantly increasing the efficiency of data-driven discoveries in physics and chemistry domains, the methods studied in this project directly apply to related disciplines such as weather forecasting or network science. This project will foster cross-disciplinary collaborations between physicists, chemists, computer scientists and applied mathematicians, and will support education and diversity by creating novel courses and outreach activities integrating these disciplines.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop the mathematical and statistical foundations of geometric deep learning---a family of neural network models and algorithms that leverage geometric properties of the data in order to solve complex tasks---and to demonstrate its effectiveness in practical settings such as the physical sciences. This will be enabled by addressing two important limitations of current deep learning methods. The first is their ability to learn how to perform algorithmic or statistical inference tasks with optimum computational complexity, which the second is their application to domains that lack the regular sampling structure of images, video, text or speech. Both objectives share a fundamental interplay between geometry and learning that this project aims to elucidate. This project pursues the notion of geometric stability, the mathematical foundation that underpins the efficiency of deep learning architectures and facilitates its extension to more general domains, modeled as graphs. This will be used to study the optimization landscape and generalization error of geometric deep learning models, where current learning theory struggles to explain its empirical performance. Finally, the project will demonstrate the effectiveness of geometric deep learning with applications to physical sciences. Most physical systems---from atoms to galaxies---are governed by complex dynamical systems and are defined over irregular, non-Euclidean domains, presenting a serious challenge for existing deep learning architectures. This project seeks to overcome these limitations by building 'physics-aware' geometric deep learning models with adaptive computational complexity, applied to particle physics, chemistry and cosmology, by incorporating prior knowledge of the physical dynamics into the graph structure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet predicting these crimes is extremely challenging because of their statistical rarity. This project uses computational methods and big data from social media to predict when virulent hate speech transitions to hate crimes. The research examines how the language of hateful speech and its dissemination over social networks predicts hate crimes. The scientific goal is to inform and advance theory and basic understanding of the social and cognitive processes that underlie extreme and hateful thoughts and how they spread. One aim is to identify mechanisms that might inhibit the dissemination of hate speech in social media. Another is to provide new tools for law enforcement. Students and faculty across many disciplines will have an opportunity to learn new computational methods for handling big data and for examining the spread of ideas online and through social media.<br/> <br/>By integrating theories of social cognition with natural language processing and machine learning techniques, this project seeks to understand how deeply-held beliefs and identity dynamics coalesce to form extreme perspectives that could result in derogation of out-groups and hate crimes.  It examines the linguistic features that characterize certain forms of social cognition and hate speech, and considers how the spatial distribution of hate speech can be estimated from sparse, biased data.  The research considers whether socially-motivated hate crimes and acts of hate speech can be predicted using unobtrusive measures and information about social networks.  The related educational and training opportunities include mentoring of students from minority-serving institutions, sharing newly-developed tools for text analysis with the wider scientific community, and workshops on machine learning and text analysis.

However, deep neural networks are not theoretically guaranteed to always perform well, and they could, although rarely, fail in the presence of previously unseen data or small/imperceptible (adversarial) changes to the data. For instance, a home security system using a deep neural network facial recognition algorithm could mistake a stranger wearing pixelated sunglasses for the homeowner; a slight change of the environment, such as a rainy day, could cause a computer vision based autonomous driving vehicle to wrongly recognize a ""STOP"" sign as an outdoor commercial sign. The existence of such failure cases in widely used machine learning systems today could put our daily lives and even national security at risk. One way to make machine learning systems robust against these failure cases is to design algorithms that are guaranteed to provide an optimal solution, generalize to unseen scenarios and be robust to adversarial changes even if the attacker is given full knowledge of the algorithm. The methods developed via this research will provide theoretical bases that explain ""black-box"" deep neural networks and provide guarantees over their performance when applied to high-stakes problems. The project will be integrated with graduate and undergraduate education, fostering collaboration between researchers from Computer Science, Applied Math, Physics and Business. Software programs developed via this project will be released as an open-source toolkit, allowing widespread dissemination to researchers and practitioners in a range of fields.<br/><br/>This project will advocate theoretically guaranteed training and understanding of neural networks via techniques from learning theory, nonconvex optimization and consistent latent variable model learning using spectral methods. The investigator's goal is to design compressed neural networks that are theoretically guaranteed to generalize well, fit into Internet of Things devices with memory constraints, and are robust to adversarial examples. Concretely, the technical aims of the project are divided into three thrusts.  (1) Guaranteed training of deep nets. The investigator proposes to develop a theoretical justification of why deep residual networks are easier to optimize than non-residual ones when each layer provides a better-than-a-weak-baseline oracle in predicting labels. The investigator plans to use two approaches to guarantee existence and implement the better-than-a-weak-baseline oracle: (a) exploiting theoretically guaranteed training of shallow convolutional neural networks, a.k.a. convolutional dictionary learning, using spectral methods and (b) ensuring escaping from local optima using Homotopy transformations to ""sharpen"" local optima of network's objective landscape as recent advances in escaping from local optima showed that SGD will not get stuck at sharp local optima with small diameters. (2) Analyzing generalization ability of compressed deep neural networks. The investigator will introduce deep neural network compression using tensorized tensor decomposition, and develop tighter bounds for generalization error, which takes the input distribution and the compressibility of the network into account.

Such systems have the potential to revolutionize modern-era energy generation by providing a clean and sustainable alternative to traditional energy systems. Thermoacoustic systems involve no combustion and therefore mitigate major concerns over the environmental footprint of fossil-fuel-based energy in the U.S. economy. The realization of thermoacoustic systems has the potential to impact a wide range of applications including space power generation, solar energy scavenging and waste heat recovery. Almost all thermoacoustic systems suffer from two inherent limitations: Low power density and design complexity. This award supports fundamental research to address both limitations by leveraging tools from dynamics and controls combined with the unique wave filtering capabilities of acoustic metamaterials. The multi-disciplinary project will develop new tools to enhance the learning experience of students in the fields of dynamics, acoustics and sustainable energy generation, and will broaden participation of underrepresented groups through a range of outreach activities. <br/><br/>ThermoAcoustic Generators (TAGs) are devices engineered to spontaneously generate powerful sound waves from a heat source which are then harnessed as electricity or mechanical motion. They have the potential to approach the entropic limit imposed by thermodynamics. This project seeks to reach this limit by developing a novel class of metamaterial-based TAGs which rely on the optimal control of phasing between pressure and velocity which prevents the formation of permanent standing waves in the acoustic resonator. The desirable acoustic conditions are achieved without additional bulk structures. Instead, inevitable nonlinearities emerging from the small and complex pores of the thermoacoustic stack will be used to synthesize a new TAG chamber that enables traveling thermoacoustic waves to propagate to one end of the resonator (where energy scavenging takes place via electro-acoustic transduction) while impeding boundary reflections. This work will combine tools from dynamic systems theory with state-of-the-art experimental and laboratory-scale investigations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This enhanced REU program will focus on training of veterans and underrepresented minority students and annually will engage 10 undergraduate students who will perform hands-on fundamental manufacturing research in several critical areas including additive manufacturing, bio-/cell-manufacturing, composites/nanocomposites manufacturing, applications of AI and robotics in manufacturing. The REVAMP REU site focuses on the critical national need of manufacturing, and more specifically, advanced manufacturing research and technology, which will play a crucial role in positioning the U.S. manufacturing sector as a continued world leader.  By leveraging the Georgia Tech Manufacturing Institute (GTMI)'s world-class facilities, diverse technical expertise, and inspiring interdisciplinary research environment, the REU activities will give students the opportunity to improve knowledge in the critically important advanced manufacturing technology topic areas noted above. Training in research methodology, performance of scientific manufacturing research, tours of manufacturing facilities, and completion of technical seminars provided by GTMI faculty will significantly expand each student's manufacturing knowledge base, preparing them for future careers in advanced manufacturing. The research experience will be enhanced by entrepreneurship training including specialized customer discovery experiential learning, seminars focused on the fundamentals of evidenced-based entrepreneurship, and case studies presented by startup company leaders offered by the GT Enterprise Innovation Institute (EI2). Through entrepreneurship training, students will also have a transformative opportunity to develop critical leadership skills for transitioning basic research discoveries into commercially-viable innovations. NSF I-Corps South programs and veteran-faculty mentorship opportunities provided by the Georgia Tech Research Institute (GTRI) will be incorporated into this renewal REVAMP REU site program.   <br/> <br/>A unique feature of this REU site is its focus on training of veterans and underrepresented minority students.

It focuses on two sites in Sao Paulo, a contemporary network of public fablabs and the 1970s-80s electronics industry, and its aim is to examine the reconfiguration of improvisation in the context of growing discussions about innovation from the global South. This work will shed light on how practices commonly considered peripheral to sophisticated technological production have been used to remake dominant models of technological development across changing contexts, contributing to current debates on innovation in a global perspective, improvisation as a technical and sociocultural phenomenon, and the relationship between skill and expertise. A key impact of this project will be to expand academic and public discussions about sustainable and inclusive technologies by attending to the cultivation of improvisational technical skills associated with fixing, repurposing, and creating technologies. It will serve to increase the participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM through its focus on community-oriented innovation hubs and collaborative methodologies. It will also provide valuable material for governmental and nongovernmental professionals working in the fields of trade, industrial, and social policy.<br/><br/>The researcher will conduct participant observation, in-depth interviews, and media and archival research to understand how improvisation has been conceptualized, used, and valued by fablab users, former electronics workers, technoactivists, municipal agents, and policymakers. The researcher has several specific goals. She will examine what happens when global corporate logics of innovation meet socially embedded experiences of improvisation; this will facilitate contributing to an emergent literature in STS that challenges the typical center-to-periphery arrows of technology transfer and diffusionist innovation theories. She also plans to investigate practices of improvisation in two contexts of technological production, one at the beginning of consumer electronics, where the manufacturing of analog devices was under strict protectionism; the other focusing on new forms of digital production in the globalized neoliberal moment, which will provide a productive genealogy for thinking about improvisation as a contemporary political-economic project in Brazil. She also proposes to combine ethnographic approaches with a robust historical framework to be able to provide a cultural dimension to the study of technology while also advancing discussions of scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using novel data sources, the research addresses questions on the role of geography, tariffs and trade barriers, improvements in ship fuel efficiency and new infrastructure developments on transportation prices and trade flows. The research looks at the efficiency of transportation sector and how social welfare can be improved through appropriate policies. The research also considers the impact of a centralizing platform, like Uber.<br/> <br/>The project develops a spatial model that centers on the interaction of the market for (oceanic) transportation services and the market for world trade in goods. The model delivers equilibrium trade flows, as well as equilibrium trade costs. This setup is then used to demonstrate that the transportation sector (i) implies that net exporters (importers) face higher (lower) trade costs leading to misallocation of productive activities across countries; (ii) creates network effects in trade costs; and (iii) dampens the impact of shocks on trade flows. These three mechanisms reveal a new role for geography in international trade. Next, the research explores both theoretically and empirically the efficiency properties of equilibria in decentralized transportation markets and suggest appropriate policies for the improvement of world welfare. The research also introduces a micro-founded trade cost in the canonical trade model in order to examine its welfare properties.

Nanoporous metal oxide electrodes embedded with platinum nanocrystals are believed to deliver high performance for metal-air batteries. Current methods for manufacturing platinum-metal oxide electrodes are impeded by inhomogeneous material distribution and composition, high energy consumption and low yield, which limit their scalable manufacturing. This award supports fundamental research to provide needed knowledge for the development of a scalable, room temperature electrochemical process for manufacturing of metal-air battery electrodes. The new process enables manufacturing of electrodes with homogeneous composition and seamless interface. Such materials result in high-performance metal-air batteries with high energy efficiencies and long cyclability. Nanoporous electrodes made from a wide variety of bifunctional catalysts are increasingly preferred for applications in energy, healthcare, biomedical, aerospace, chemical or automotive industries. Therefore, results from this research benefit the U.S. economy and society. This research involves several disciplines including manufacturing, electrochemistry, and materials science. The multi-disciplinary approach helps broaden participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impacts engineering education.<br/><br/>The pulse electrochemical manufacturing process overcomes several limitations of current electrochemical manufacturing techniques, which are lack of morphology and composition control and difficulty in the control of selective growth and etching kinetics. However, some scientific barriers are yet to be overcome to realize the full application potential of pulse electrochemical deposition and anodization for scalable manufacturing. This research is to fill the knowledge gap on the mechanisms of platinum nanocrystal (Pt-NC) facet selective growth and nanoporous framework formation during electrochemical deposition and anodization. The objectives are (1) to explore the nucleation and bottom-up growth kinetics of Pt-NCs in complex electrochemical systems containing multiple cations by using pulse electrochemical deposition, (2) to understand the roles of dynamic O2 bubbles in selective metal oxidation, etching, and nanopore top-down growth processes by pulse anodization, and (3) to uncover the processing-microstructure-property relationships in designing, manufacturing, and applying Pt-embedded metal oxide electrodes for metal-air batteries. The research team plans to perform advanced electrochemical analyses and materials characterizations to understand the mechanism of nanopore formation in electrochemical deposition and anodization, test the hypothesis that pulse voltage and frequency are the determining factors for nanopores and selective facets of Pt-NCs in electrochemical manufacturing, and establish relationships between process parameters and porosity in electrochemical deposition and anodization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How fast microbes oxidize carbon determines how much either stays in soils or is emitted as carbon dioxide.  Even a small increase in soil carbon oxidation rate could increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, impacting global climate. Manganese (Mn) is an abundant and potent oxidizer, but its impact on the rate of soil carbon oxidation is not known. This project will provide new understanding of how manganese compounds change how fast carbon is oxidized in soils. This new scientific knowledge will help improve our predictions of future carbon dioxide emissions and will help society develop new strategies to limit emissions. This project will work with diversity programs on campus and in the local community to empower women and minority students to pursue STEM careers. <br/><br/>The formation of Mn-based oxidants is emerging as a key regulator of C oxidation rates, and thus CO2 emissions, in soils. Although dissolved Mn(III) species are among the most potent oxidants in environmental systems, the controls on Mn(III)-driven carbon oxidation are virtually unknown. The overall objective of this project is to identify fundamental geochemical and microbial factors controlling the rate of Mn(III)-mediated carbon oxidation in soils. Our central hypothesis is that oxic-anoxic interfaces are ""hotspots"" for the enzymatic formation of dissolved Mn(III), which subsequently depolymerizes and solubilizes otherwise resistant organic matter, and so enhances microbial CO2 production. The proposed research integrates microsensor, spectroscopic, and multi-omics approaches to resolve coupled Mn and carbon cycles across fine-scale gradients in soils. To accomplish the overall objective, the specific aims are to (i) define the geochemical controls on Mn(III) formation along oxic-, (ii) identify the microbial drivers of Mn(III) formation, and (iii) assess the impact of Mn(III) formation on C oxidation at oxic-anoxic interfaces in soils. Disseminating the resulting dataset will support efforts to incorporate the coupling of Mn and C redox cycles into biogeochemical models. Integrating the highly significant Mn-dependence of C oxidation into models for the first time is expected to vastly improve accuracy in predicting environmental and human impacts on soil CO2 emissions.  The project team will work to incorporate this multidisciplinary research effort into strategies to empower women and minority graduate, undergraduate and high school students to pursue STEM careers. A three-point plan integrates this research with direct interdisciplinary education and public outreach, which includes: (i) graduate training in biogeochemistry for one minority PhD student, (ii) opportunities for independent research for three minority undergraduate students in partnership with the Harvard Forest REU program, and (iii) multi-day workshops for a total of 45 female minority students from a local high school hosted in collaboration with Girls Inc. Holyoke, Massachusetts. Educational materials developed for the workshops will be disseminated through participation in the annual Massachusetts Envirothon. A thorough evaluation plan was developed in collaboration with Harvard Forest and Girls Inc. staff to measure the success of the proposed Broader Impacts activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project involves a partnership between the University of the Pacific, San Joaquin Delta Community College, the San Joaquin County Office of Education STEM Office, and several partner school districts in San Joaquin County.  The overarching goal of the project is to address an acute shortage of STEM teachers in the county, particularly at the high school level. The project is designed to recruit STEM undergraduates and prepare them for long-term teaching careers in high-need school districts.  In addition, the project aims to institutionalize the project activities as components of the University's STEM teacher preparation program. Noyce Scholars will receive up to three years of scholarship support for their junior, senior, and master's certification year, and will serve two years in a high-need school district for each year of financial support.  Project activities and supports for student success will begin in each Scholar's junior year, continue through completion of a Master of Arts in Education and the first years of teaching. Through their interactions with exemplary classroom teachers and accomplished University researchers, the Noyce Scholars will be integrated into a supportive network of STEM educators. <br/><br/>Recruitment of scholarship recipients will primarily target students from Delta College who transfer into STEM majors at the University of the Pacific.  Upon completion of the master's program, the Scholars will receive both a baccalaureate degree in a STEM discipline and a master's degree in education. In addition, first- and second-year STEM majors at the University of the Pacific will also be recruited. While they complete their STEM degrees, Noyce Scholars will begin taking education coursework, including a Noyce seminar that will connect them with local Master STEM teachers and include reflective writing about their experiences throughout the program. During their junior and senior years, the Scholars will have undergraduate research experiences with University of the Pacific STEM faculty and will engage in education-related service-learning activities in the local community. During their Master of Arts in Education year, they will gain supervised student teaching experience in high-need schools in San Joaquin County. The University of the Pacific and the county STEM office, in collaboration with partner school districts, will support the Noyce Scholars in their early years of teaching through on-site mentoring relationships and school year/summer professional development activities. The project will investigate the degree to which these pre-service activities and induction supports help retain new STEM teachers in the profession.  This information can contribute to addressing the critical need to prepare highly effective STEM teachers in San Joaquin County and in other high-need schools and districts. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

These changes affect many aspects of our lives and threaten our food supply, necessitating both understanding and action. Changes in weather conditions such as heat or cold waves, drought, or flooding can directly impact the growth of crops, as well as alter the balance between crop plants and the pathogens they encounter, potentially resulting in large-scale outbreaks of diseases. In addition, some of these changes can occur simultaneously, for example during a combination of a prolonged drought period and a heat wave, resulting in devastating impacts on our agriculture and economy. How to prepare for such changes and how to attempt to mitigate their impact directly depends on the understanding of basic mechanisms underlying the interaction of plants with different biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as their combination. To address these challenges, as well as to enhance the understanding of basic signaling mechanisms underlying the interaction of plants with different biotic and abiotic stresses, a new addition is organized to the Annual Interdisciplinary Plant Group (IPG) Symposium entitled: ""Plant Signaling in Biotic and Abiotic Stress"".<br/><br/>The conference entitled: ""Plant Signaling in Biotic and Abiotic Stress"" will provide a forum in which faculty, students, and postdoctoral fellows, from diverse backgrounds, can interact with prominent scholars in the plant biology community who are all studying signal transduction mechanisms that control plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, as well as their integration. The intent is to provide a platform that promotes cross-disciplinary interactions, networking, and an exchange of ideas. The expected outcomes of the meeting are: (a) enhanced understanding of how different stresses integrate at the molecular level; (b) enhanced understanding of how this information is communicated from one or more local cells to the entire plant (systemic signaling); and (c) uncovering of key signaling hubs that could be manipulated for enhancing the tolerance of plants to their environment. The planned symposium includes a concerted effort to broaden the participation of undergraduate students, and includes women, minority and young scientists in a significant role as speakers.

Policy initiatives have proliferated under the assumption that mobile phones have the ability to foster improvements in development sectors, particularly in subsistence agriculture (by, for example, allowing farmers to check weather forecasts). However, there has been little cross-national empirical research investigating whether mobile phones in aggregate contribute to development outcomes. If mobile phones contribute to agrarian sector development in the way that policy narratives and case studies suggest, their distribution should have positive impacts on global food security across-countries and over time.  Findings from this study will contribute to public welfare and security by testing the assumption underlying the promise of mobile phones as a development tool.  <br/><br/>Building on case study findings that find support for the economic, political, health, and educational benefits of access to newer information and communication technologies, this project uses a quantitative cross-national comparative research design to explain patterns of mobile phone distribution and access.

The student projects involve numerical modeling, data analysis from space missions currently being supported at the CfA, such as Hinode, SDO, IRIS, Wind, DISCOVR, and Parker Solar Probe or engineering projects related to solar instrumentation being built at the CfA, depending on the students' interests and abilities.  With its strong Space Weather component this program has the benefit to society of adding to our understanding of potential space hazards. Moreover, this program will provide exposure to professional research in a university environment with a goal of helping students to decide whether to continue their education in graduate school, and whether or not to pursue research as a profession.  A student outreach component of the program will bring educational activities to the local community. The target group of students consists of undergraduates in Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) disciplines, with a preference for underrepresented groups in STEM fields and students from small colleges where there are few research opportunities.   <br/><br/>The primary goals of this program are to 1) develop students with demonstrated talent and potential by stimulating independence, creativity and cultivating an interest in physics, astronomy and engineering graduate school, 2) demonstrate to participants how academic knowledge acquired in classes applies to real-word research problems, 3) foster participation in scientific research by women and traditionally underrepresented groups in scientific research, 4) increase awareness of solar physics as a field of study, 5) develop student competence and confidence in presenting scientific research in a  public forum, 6) provide a high-quality research experience, and 7) accomplish state-of-the-art solar research.  Since the projects are designed to be part of cutting-edge solar physics research, student projects will frequently result in joint professional publications or presentations with their CfA mentors, providing undergraduates with valuable motivation and career development experiences. Since Solar Physics is taught at relatively few colleges and universities, this program provides an important service to the discipline. The proposal will encourage minority student applications through contacts with other minority-serving internship programs on campus, recommendations from professional contacts at minority serving institutions, advertising the program at conferences such as the National Society for Black Physicists, and a broad advertising campaign targeted at minority colleges and universities.

There is a general lack of engineering knowledge, limited awareness by K-12 teachers about engineering careers, and absence of appropriate role models. Research has shown that early exposure to engineering can significantly increase students' awareness of this discipline as a rewarding career path. The Engineering Academy (EA) at Stony Brook University addresses factors that inhibit involvement in engineering, by engaging students and teachers from low achieving middle schools in the passion, challenges and opportunities of engineering. The project will impact a broad spectrum of participants, with focus on low income students. Students will be exposed to cross-cutting engineering knowledge and skills. Teachers will learn innovative engineering instructional practices that will impact students for many years in the future. Professional engineers will inspire participants by sharing their career experiences; faculty will integrate their expertise in science education and engineering; and Stony Brook University will broaden its vision, mission and role in 6th-8th grade education. The results will be a model for a sustainable and scalable partnership that demonstrates meaningful implementation of the Next Generation Science Standards, addressing student education and teacher professional learning. <br/><br/>This unique program addresses several documented weaknesses in engineering education.

For example, knowledge or facts are often structured into knowledge graphs, brain activity is represented via functional networks, and neural networks can be seen as evolving graph structures. This project aims to develop computational methods and models to summarize, explain, and provide insights into massive data (and their underlying dynamic processes) at multiple scales in a broad range of domains. Focusing on knowledge graphs makes it possible to achieve on-device and privacy-preserving analytics (e.g., on intelligent assistants). Modeling neural networks is expected to give insights into their interpretability and reduce their massive training computational cost. Through collaborations with experts in neuroscience, this research will contribute to decoding the brain, with a potential impact on mental development and disease detection. A significant part of this project is a plan for integrating research with education. Its overarching theme is to increase diversity in computer and data science, and engage students in graph mining research and its real-life applications via: introducing undergraduate and graduate data mining classes; mentoring students on data science projects for social good; organizing a workshop to attract undergraduates from diverse backgrounds to graduate school; and organizing a high-school data science summer camp centered around social media and networks, a theme that is a successful introduction to network science.<br/><br/>Network summarization, which identifies structure and meaning in large-scale data, so far has mostly focused on non-complex, static data. This project aims to bridge the gap between network summarization research and real-world problems by introducing novel problem formulations in summarization (including for tasks that have not been previously viewed as graph problems) as well as theoretical analyses, unifying theories, and a suite of new, interpretable methods and scalable algorithms. It pursues three research tasks related to network evolution at different scales. At the network scale, the first task focuses on efficient, supervised or semi-supervised summarization of evolving and semantically-rich graph data (e.g., heterogeneous). At the multi-network scale, the second task introduces interpretable methods for modeling and understanding collections of evolving networks and their joint underlying physical processes, which is an under-studied problem in data mining. Via academic and industrial collaborations, the third task explores new applications in knowledge graphs, neuroscience, deep neural networks, and social sciences. The project is expected to advance the foundations of exploratory analysis of evolving data. Its outcomes will be disseminated through publications, tutorials, workshops, as well as open-source tools, code and datasets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While policymakers, school boards, and parents attempt to exert influence over health education policies, health educators must decide what and how to teach. Even when given mandated curricula, health educators sometimes find ways to repurpose health education for their students. Yet we do not fully understand what circumstances or characteristics allow for such action or how health educators negotiate gaps between curricula and what they believe their students need. Further, health educators are not a homogenous group. While some are full-time, certified health educators who teach in a variety of settings, others are school teachers who teach health education as one part of their job. Scant research describes health education from health educator perspective or compares the experiences of community and teacher health educators in schools. This study will provide needed evidence to address these gaps. Findings from this project will inform professional organizations that train and support health educators, thus promoting efforts to improve the quality and delivery of health education. <br/><br/>This qualitative study will generate interview data from 50 school-based health educators, comprised of 25 community health educators and 25 teacher health educators. The project will recruit participants from health education conferences, professional directories, community health organizations, schools, and professional teacher associations. The interviews will describe teaching school-based health education from the perspective of health educators, particularly their experiences with challenges and opportunities. The project will assess how health educator experiences are shaped by employment context, comparing community and teacher health educators to identify how differences in training, employment, and years of experience structure these roles. The project will also consider how health educator personal characteristics, such as race, social class, gender, and age, and structural contexts such as geographical location and school characteristics, such as school size, shape their classroom experiences. The analysis will proceed in two phases. First, the project will code each interview line-by-line, noting any instances of new ideas, orientations, or experiences, and allowing the data to guide which themes emerge. Second, the project will engage in a close analysis of the relationship between the data and theory. The project will review and study the codes from the first phase to determine similarities and differences, reveal patterns that are defining features of the interviews, and identify instances that diverge from the expected themes or initial findings.  Findings will inform sociological theories regarding professionalization and professional autonomy, particularly in the key context of education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Findings from the evaluation will be disseminated in a range of forums to allow others, particularly those serving Native American students, to tap into the project's lessons learned.<br/><br/>The ICE-TI II project builds capacity in STEM instruction and research at CCCC through a comprehensive set of innovations in instruction and curriculum development. The project is designed to impact multiple system levels, including individuals, organizations, communities, and the broader society. Activities include increasing the use of problem-based learning and new educational resources, providing academic and non-academic services to ameliorate barriers to student engagement and retention, and supporting students' advancement from the two-year college experience through the transition to four-year colleges, graduate studies, and entrance into the workforce. Using Community-Based Participatory Action Research principles and employing a staggered, prospective multiple-cohort design, the project seeks to investigate questions about how best to support underprepared students? success in college. Since the Carnegie Math Pathways is a recently developed strategy, this project contributes to the emerging body of knowledge about the efficacy of CMP, especially for American Indian students and those living in rural areas. The project will inform future evaluations, as well, by assessing the psychometrics of instruments used to measure characteristics of American Indian students that may influence their academic success.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The workshop will provide a context for critically examining the empirical significance of appeals to representations. It will bring together philosophers and neuroscientists with overlapping interests in conceptual and empirical challenges related to the search for representations in the brain. The primary goal of the workshop is to identify empirical criteria for individuating representational states and specifying their content within the domains of memory, perception, and action. The workshop will result in a collection of journal articles published in an open access venue that will demonstrate the value of focused interdisciplinary collaborations between philosophers and neuroscientists. The curated program and organizational plan will also be widely shared after the workshop, along with reflections on its effectiveness.<br/><br/>This interdisciplinary workshop brings together philosophers and neuroscientists to focus on the notion of representation and its relationships to neural processes. Neuroscientists investigating human cognition with neuroimaging technology often describe their findings in terms of representations. This concept is ubiquitous, but its meaning and significance varies. Sometimes representations are treated as genuine phenomena that are the targets of investigation and intervention, and at other times the concept is used as a theoretically insignificant stand-in for claims about information carried by or transformed in neural processes. If the concept of representation carries any empirical significance, fully exploiting that significance requires an account of what kind of evidence is required to justify claims about the content and role such a state plays in realizing cognitive capacities. In light of this, workshop participants will focus on three central questions: What is the significance of identifying a pattern of brain activity as a representation? What evidence is required to make such an attribution? Can neuroimaging technologies provide that evidence? Approaching these questions from a purely empirical perspective may end up reinforcing the ambiguities already present in the cognitive neuroscience literature and doing so from a purely philosophical perspective risks generating accounts of representation that are not amenable to empirical investigation. An integrative, interdisciplinary approach seems to be the best path forward.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this project will study the pressure of the fluids filling the eye globe, also called intraocular pressure, whose control is crucial to maintain a proper visual function. Chronically high intraocular pressure is associated with high risk of developing glaucoma, a progressive optic neuropathy characterized by a loss of retinal ganglion cells and permanent vision loss. Glaucoma constitutes one of the leading causes of irreversible blindness worldwide. Despite the importance of maintaining healthy levels of intraocular pressure, to date, the question of what is its optimal range for a given individual remains unanswered. The variability in outcomes, side effects and hemodynamic impacts following medications that lower intraocular pressure in glaucoma patients poses an additional, and currently unresolved, challenge in preventing vision loss for millions of individuals. The PIs will address this critical need by utilizing the laws of physics to develop a virtual laboratory where the relationship between intraocular pressure, medications, hemodynamics and ocular function can be studied quantitatively, and the optimal target level for intraocular pressure and the therapeutic strategy to achieve it can be theoretically estimated by accounting for patient's specific conditions. <br/> <br/>The development of a virtual laboratory to study ocular physiology and function requires to account for multiple length scales simultaneously. Since the action of medications occurs at the cellular level (approx. length scale: 100 microns), even down to the ion exchangers across the membrane of the non-pigmented epithelial cells within the ciliary processes (approx. length scale: 10 nm), while the clinical assessments of ocular hemodynamics and function occur at the whole organ level (approx. length scale: 3cm), it is necessary to adopt a multiscale modeling approach. The main challenges of this project are: (i) capturing the essential biophysical features of ocular physiology across length scales that differ by 6 orders of magnitude, while maintaining the solution of the overall model affordable; (ii) preserving the essential biophysical features of ocular physiology when discretizing the multiscale problem in order to obtain its approximate numerical solution; (iii) validating the model predictions with a large and comprehensive clinical and experimental dataset. To best address these challenges and successfully complete this project, the model development is articulated into two specific aims: (Aim 1) Multiscale modeling of the relationship between aqueous humor flow and medications for intraocular pressure to theoretically investigate the hypotensive efficacy on patients presenting different clinical conditions; (Aim2) Multiscale modeling of the relationship between aqueous humor flow and ocular perfusion to theoretically investigate the changes on ocular hemodynamics and function in patients presenting different clinical conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The award supports fundamental research that will enable a currently unavailable, non-destructive material characterization protocol for obtaining the material property maps, which will allow the deformation and stability of these materials to be better understood. The innovative approach in this project is expected to promote scientific advancement in new mechanics knowledge that is important for a wide range of healthcare and biomedical applications, thereby impacting the national health and economy.  The project will provide opportunities to train graduate and undergraduate students in the important interdisciplinary areas of mechanics, materials science, and biomedical devices.

The objective of this CAREER project is to test the hypothesis that a higher degree of heterogeneity in thin membranes reduces the critical buckling loads. The research approach is to experimentally measure and compare the buckling loads of a set of thin membranes of various degrees of heterogeneity ranging from highly heterogeneous to homogeneous.

It includes an education plan focused on transferring the research to improve education.  Because these context-rich, problem-solving experiences more closely mimic professional work, they offer important venues for STEM workforce development. However, these environments tend to be resource and time-intensive compared to lecture courses, so it is important to understand their unique benefits. The level of ""context"" refers to the complexity of the goals, tools, and applications for learning. While there is a substantial amount of education research related to lower-context learning, such as active learning in lecture courses emphasizing knowing, concepts, and the acquisition of knowledge, there has been less education research on high context (""context-rich"") environments. such as laboratories and actual research experiences that involve practice.  The project will support the improvement of context-rich experiences that develop the science and engineering workforce, support retention and diversity, create free and publicly available assessments for STEM faculty, and guide policies on expanding and improving access to research experiences and other context-rich environments.  The project addresses a national need for research that can inform the development, testing, validation, and dissemination of assessments of learning in context-rich environments and guide education policy.<br/><br/>This research will examine how context-rich experiences prepare students for STEM workforce careers.   The research plan involves describing the experience, observing evidence for learning, comparisons of activities, outcomes, and the development of new assessments.  The conceptual framework is based on applying Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) to learning in context-rich settings.  CHAT provides a perspective that situates cognition within an activity system that relates a subject, an objective, and a community as an activity system that accomplishes practical outcomes. Data collection and analysis will utilize Social Cognitive Career Theory (SCCT), particularly to understand mechanisms and factors within context-rich problem-solving environments that support outcomes such as development of professional identity, self-efficacy, and persistence.  The education plan involves a project based first-year physics course, as well as the development of a set of validated tools that could be used for the assessment of learning in context-rich environments.  Thus, the education plan is integrated with the research activities and would provide both local (course-specific) and transferable (disseminated) outcomes.  <br/><br/>The CAREER program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that offers awards in support of junior faculty who exemplify the role of teacher-scholars through outstanding research, excellent education, and the integration of education and research within the context of the mission of their organizations.

Two examples are the many microbes associated with the human body (e.g., gut microbiome) and species that contribute to soil fertility and plant health. These natural microbial consortia that contain many different species, are often composed of poorly-characterized microbes. They also have complicated signaling networks of compounds and metabolites that are exchanged between community members. The complexity of natural consortia makes them difficult to study and can obscure identification of common principles that underlie many different communities. Consequently, many fundamental questions remain about how microbial consortia are organized to maintain productivity and resilience in the face of dynamic environmental conditions. This project makes use of artificial microbial communities that are relatively simple and composed of well-characterized microbes. These features of the artificial communities are chosen to facilitate an investigation that would lead to insight into underlying principles that guide the structure and function of microbial communities. The research activities increase knowledge of interaction dynamics in microbial communities, potentially improving the ability to engineer microbial consortia. The research also provides insight into the evolution of natural microbial symbioses. Through this project two graduate students and one postdoctoral fellow are trained. In addition, there are multiple undergraduate research experience opportunities. The project also involves promoting the development of public forums for the discussion of potential benefits and ethical concerns of bioengineering. These forums are hosted in the Michigan Science Center in Detroit.<br/><br/>The research team is using a cyanobacterium (Synechococcus elongatus PCC 7942) that produces and secretes large quantities of sucrose from light and CO2. The PI has demonstrated that a variety of other microbes can be cultivated in the same media in a ""modular"" fashion. In these circumstances the co-cultured partner consumes the sucrose produced by the cyanobacteria. The flexibility in the design of these artificial microbial communities allows different heterotrophic bacteria to be cultivated with the cyanobacterium. In this way, common themes and mechanisms of interaction between the co-cultured species are identified. Approaches that include rational engineering, forward genetics, directed evolution, metabolic modeling, and individual-based simulations are used to identify the metabolites and signals exchanged between species. These approaches are also used to determine how metabolite exchanges contribute to consortia robustness. The knowledge gained is used to rationally design microbial communities that are more robust in the face of environmental pressures, such as invasion by ""non-cooperating"" microbial species. It is anticipated that the research efforts from this proposal will provide insights into fundamental interactions underpinning natural microbial symbioses, with translational impacts for the development of environmentally-sustainable cyanobacterial biotechnologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to the detrimental effects on human health and loss of life, the economic impact of cardiovascular diseases is tens of billions of dollars annually in the US. Diseases associated with plaque formation, such as atherosclerosis, are triggered by the biochemical signals expressed by the arterial lining cells in direct contact with the blood, the endothelial cells. It is known that the endothelial cells transmit biochemical signals to adjacent smooth muscle cell layers that control the properties of the arteries, such as their stiffness and cross-sectional area through which the blood flows.  These biochemical signals are, in part, the response of the cells to the mechanical forces that they see as the blood flows past.  The objective of this project is to study how these cells respond to complex flows, such as those that occur in various parts of the vasculature (e.g. regions of curvature, constrictions, branching). This project will produce novel, 3D bioprinted blood vessel models with endothelial cells based on actual physiological arteries.  These realistic bioreactors will then be subjected to blood flow that mimics the natural physiology. This study will improve the understanding of the interactions of blood flow and arterial lining cells under realistic conditions.  This advancement in understanding may eventually translate to research to address the onset and progression  of vascular diseases. The project also supports substantial outreach to enhance the participation of underrepresented students in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project includes a combination of experimental and computational modeling along with the development of realistic bioreactors for the assessment of endothelial response.  Vascular structures are complex, and the combination of external and internal geometry, including curvature, tortuosity, and stenoses, leads to flow fields that are variable in both space and time.  In the first aim, the research will use state-of-the-art, non-invasive laser-based techniques, such as Particle Image Velocimetry, to measure the entire flow field in patient-specific vascular geometries.  This will be combined with the assessment of wall shear stress distributions determined from computational simulations. These realistic geometries will create the complex physiological and pathophysiological flows, including secondary flows and stenosis-induced flow separations, that are seen in natural vascular structures.  In aim 2, the patient-specific geometries will be replicated through 3D bioprinted structures that include endothelial cells.  These realistic bioreactors will be used to measure cellular biochemical signaling within these vessels under different flow conditions through cell staining, immunofluorescence imaging, and gene analysis. By integrating these two approaches from different disciplines, the project will be able to examine the cause and effect between the complex blood flow and the resulting cell response.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Both the UK's and Israel's programs entailed the creation of compulsory national biometric ID cards and databases for their own citizens. The dissertation project conceptualizes biometric data as simultaneously biological and digital sites of individual and national identity construction, and it explores how national biometric identification programs create new forms of states, citizens, and the relationships between them. The results of this project will speak to the social, political, and ethical stakes of creating technological infrastructures of personal information collection. It may serve as a useful resource for future deliberations about whether, and how, personal data should be collected and stored; in addition, it will expand conceptualizations of surveillance to include a plurality of government motivations, public concerns, and social implications.<br/><br/>This project uses national biometric identification as a lens for probing the politics of technology, surveillance, and identity in the UK and Israel; it will explore how and why biometric identification did (or did not) become these states' preferred technique for verifying the identities of their citizens. The results of this research will contribute to STS literature on the relationship between technology and identity, the co-production of technology and forms of governance, and the relationship between the politics of technology and national politics. A key conceptual innovation of the project is its introduction and elaboration of a new concept, the ""biometricization of identity,"" which concerns the ways that people contend with the placement of the locus of individual identity onto digital, numerical representations of the human body. The project will make use of this new concept as a window for exploring a second theme, the technological and political development of the ""biometric state,"" by drawing on a key STS insight, that the ways people relate technologies to themselves also shape the ways technologies are governed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PETRA mission is to promote interdisciplinary research on ways to use pervasive ambient intelligent environments to improve the quality of life and enhance human performance with greater capabilities.  It is the only annual conference that brings together theoreticians and practitioners from a wide variety of disciplines to focus on the application of pervasive technologies to assistive environments.  Outcomes of this conference have a broad impact in diverse application areas such as manufacturing, transportation, energy systems, security and safety, robotics, healthcare, biomedicine, environment and conservation.  PETRA brings together very different types of technologies to also address important social and healthcare issues for sensitive populations, such as the elderly, or persons suffering from chronic conditions such as Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, Cerebral Palsy and other disabilities or traumas.  The PETRA proceedings are published in the ACM Digital Library, and the authors of the best papers are invited to submit to special journal issues after the end of the conference.  More information about the conference may be found online at http://www.petrae.org.  The PETRA 2019 Doctoral Consortium will afford student authors of papers accepted for presentation at the conference a unique opportunity to gain additional exposure for their innovative ideas while also receiving reinforcement for the importance and value of conducting research with societal impact.  The workshop will allow the junior participants to create a social network both among themselves and with senior colleagues. The organizing committee will make a concerted effort to attract participants who are women, members of under-represented minorities, and persons with disabilities; to further assure diversity, NSF funds will be used to support no more than 2 student participants from any one institution, and if 2 students are supported, one of them must be a minority or person with disability.  To date, over 250 students based in U.S. educational institutions have been able to benefit from NSF support of the PETRA Doctoral Consortia.<br/><br/>The goals of the Doctoral Consortium, which will consist of special sessions at the beginning, during, and at the end of the conference, are to increase the exposure and visibility of the participants' work within the community, to help establish a sense of community among this next generation of researchers, and to help foster their research efforts by providing substantive feedback and guidance in a supportive and interactive environment from a group of senior researchers.  The special program organized for the students includes sessions between the doctoral students and the faculty mentors, in which the students will discuss their work and ask questions; the faculty mentors will provide constructive comments on the students' work and address their questions.

Remarkably little is known about the general and specific processes by which scientific findings from one field are actually used by researchers in other fields, and by others more generally. The project focuses on knowledge from the field of human population genomics. The researchers will develop a case study of resituating knowledge from human population genomics that focuses on two research university laboratories. The project will offer insight and recommendations from both STS and life-sciences perspectives on how to foster collaboration between life scientists and the individuals and communities they study, and between these and other stakeholders concerned with issues of race, ethnicity, identity, and health. <br/><br/>The aim of this research project is to advance understanding how various objects of knowledge (models, datasets, findings, and software) in one field, human population genomics, are engaged by other audiences including scientists in other fields, the populations represented in the studies, and through various media. The researchers will use a combination of ethnographic fieldwork, archival study, concept tracking, citation analysis, and topic modeling methods to develop a detailed mechanistic account of how scientists produce, use and reuse in their workflows a variety of objects of scientific knowledge. This is a timely and important case study; the field of human population genomics is being reshaped by its enhanced use of hypothesis-driven and big data approaches, and its results influence global comparative biomedical research, policies of inclusion and access to health services, and collective and individual identity processes as patients and genomic data consumers appropriate or contest findings about themselves.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How fast microbes oxidize carbon determines how much either stays in soils or is emitted as carbon dioxide.  Even a small increase in soil carbon oxidation rate could increase the amount of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, impacting global climate. Manganese (Mn) is an abundant and potent oxidizer, but its impact on the rate of soil carbon oxidation is not known. This project will provide new understanding of how manganese compounds change how fast carbon is oxidized in soils. This new scientific knowledge will help improve our predictions of future carbon dioxide emissions and will help society develop new strategies to limit emissions. This project will work with diversity programs on campus and in the local community to empower women and minority students to pursue STEM careers. <br/><br/>The formation of Mn-based oxidants is emerging as a key regulator of C oxidation rates, and thus CO2 emissions, in soils. Although dissolved Mn(III) species are among the most potent oxidants in environmental systems, the controls on Mn(III)-driven carbon oxidation are virtually unknown. The overall objective of this project is to identify fundamental geochemical and microbial factors controlling the rate of Mn(III)-mediated carbon oxidation in soils. Our central hypothesis is that oxic-anoxic interfaces are ""hotspots"" for the enzymatic formation of dissolved Mn(III), which subsequently depolymerizes and solubilizes otherwise resistant organic matter, and so enhances microbial CO2 production. The proposed research integrates microsensor, spectroscopic, and multi-omics approaches to resolve coupled Mn and carbon cycles across fine-scale gradients in soils. To accomplish the overall objective, the specific aims are to (i) define the geochemical controls on Mn(III) formation along oxic-, (ii) identify the microbial drivers of Mn(III) formation, and (iii) assess the impact of Mn(III) formation on C oxidation at oxic-anoxic interfaces in soils. Disseminating the resulting dataset will support efforts to incorporate the coupling of Mn and C redox cycles into biogeochemical models. Integrating the highly significant Mn-dependence of C oxidation into models for the first time is expected to vastly improve accuracy in predicting environmental and human impacts on soil CO2 emissions.  The project team will work to incorporate this multidisciplinary research effort into strategies to empower women and minority graduate, undergraduate and high school students to pursue STEM careers. A three-point plan integrates this research with direct interdisciplinary education and public outreach, which includes: (i) graduate training in biogeochemistry for one minority PhD student, (ii) opportunities for independent research for three minority undergraduate students in partnership with the Harvard Forest REU program, and (iii) multi-day workshops for a total of 45 female minority students from a local high school hosted in collaboration with Girls Inc. Holyoke, Massachusetts. Educational materials developed for the workshops will be disseminated through participation in the annual Massachusetts Envirothon. A thorough evaluation plan was developed in collaboration with Harvard Forest and Girls Inc. staff to measure the success of the proposed Broader Impacts activities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Performance-based wind engineering (PBWE) has received considerable attention in recent years, especially for the study of building structures. PBWE is necessary to advance the analysis of the next-generation, super-tall buildings and tower structures, in which a core lateral resisting system is combined with a three-dimensional system of lateral bracings through stay-cables. The three-dimensional arrangement of the stays, which may reach unprecedented lengths, makes this type of structure particularly complex. One of the technological challenges is the need for forming a cable network by connecting the stays using transverse restrainers that can reduce sensitivity to wind-induced vibration. This unique structural configuration is particularly interesting for future building construction, but the wind-induced dynamics of this configuration is not fully understood. Understanding the performance of tall structures in the setting of PBWE can lead to better structural configurations for a given set of loading conditions, consistent with desired levels of safety and affordable cost, thus promoting national welfare and prosperity.  Research results will be incorporated into teaching modules at Northeastern University for an existing graduate course in wind engineering and a new special topics course on the computational mechanics of random structural systems. Project data will be archived and made publicly available in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). <br/><br/><br/>This project will examine the dynamic response of tall buildings and tall towers under the effect of turbulent wind loads within the setting of PBWE. A benchmark building structure with appropriate parametric modifications of configuration will be considered. The research will explore the implementation of computationally efficient, scalable algorithms for studying the aeroelasticity of tall structures. The numerical procedures will also use state-of-the-art software for grid and cloud computing through collaboration with experts from international academic institutions and a software research company. Stochastic numerical solvers will be employed to extract natural frequencies and principal vibration modes from an initial random eigenvalue problem (with partially unknown or random properties due to structural complexity), and subsequently evaluate the wind-induced dynamic response in the frequency domain. The project will examine the structural performance under the influence of estimation errors in the aerodynamic loads and the derivation of structural fragility curves or surfaces, needed for estimation of either structural failure or loss of functionality within PBWE.  Research outcomes will include the identification of key parameters characterizing safe structural operations by efficient computation of fragility (e.g., displacements and accelerations). Parametric studies will also unfold relevant details on the wind-induced dynamics of tall buildings and towers, which will assist engineers in the design of these systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental understanding of the dynamical processes associated with the temperature- and composition- dependent flow behavior of the parent   melts or liquids from which these glasses are derived, is crucial in all stages of their industrial production. This project aims to provide unique knowledge regarding the connection between the ""microscopic (atomistic)"" and the ""macroscopic"" aspects of the dynamical behavior of chalcogenide liquids   for the very first time, using a combination of cutting-edge characterization techniques. This knowledge is key to the optimization of the chemistry and processing parameters of these materials for improved and novel functionality, thereby enabling their application in modern transformative technologies with strong societal impact. Scientifically, this work impacts materials science, physical chemistry, and solid-state physics. The interdisciplinary nature of this work transfers knowledge between fields and provides students with unique opportunities for intellectual growth. Graduates typically find employment in both academia and in glass and semiconductor industry. The impact of this project in terms of education and outreach is in three major areas: (1) participation by students in research, (2) active and tight-knit collaboration with industry (Corning, Inc.) where students are mentored and gain understanding of industry priorities, and (3) dissemination of knowledge about glass science and technology to the broader scientific community. The research findings are embedded into special topics courses that are offered to students in materials science, chemistry, and other related fields; and they contribute to campus programs for women and minority students and to the recruitment of promising students from underrepresented and economically-disadvantaged groups.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: The dynamical processes in supercooled glass-forming liquids, associated with their viscous flow, structural relaxation and annealing near the glass transition, control all aspects of the processing and technological utility of the resulting glasses and glass-ceramics. However, surprisingly enough, little is known regarding the connection between the atomic structure, its connectivity and topology and the temperature dependence of the flow behavior of chalcogenide liquids. Historically, therefore, much of the approach for designing new chalcogenide glasses has been largely empirical and lacked the predictive power needed for their compositional optimization and processing methods. This GOALI project brings together investigators with complementary expertise and common interests from UC Davis (Sen, PI) and from Corning Incorporated (Aitken, co-PI), to investigate the effects of structural connectivity and topology on the temperature dependence of the viscoelastic behavior and relaxation processes in supercooled chalcogenide (sulfide and selenide) liquids, using a unique combination of state-of-the-art oscillatory parallel-plate rheometry, dynamical nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry measurements. Predictive atomistic models of structure-relaxation-viscous flow relationships, built on the basis of the results obtained in this project, may enable the optimization of the chemistry, synthesis, and processing parameters of these complex materials for a wide range of modern technological applications. The focus of this project, namely how and why, the various aspects of the atomic structure control the temperature dependent viscoelasticity, relaxational behavior and related phenomena in chalcogenide glass-forming liquids is in itself crosscutting materials research. The breadth, flexibility and interdisciplinary nature of this project prepare the students with powerful experimental skills and research experience in both academic and industrial settings that may open many future career opportunities. It also enriches the graduate education and training experience through numerous scientific interactions   between the collaborating scientists and participating students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ICAD is the premier international forum for presenting research on the use of sound to display data, monitor systems, and provide enhanced user interfaces for computers and virtual reality systems.  It is unique in its singular focus on auditory displays and the array of perception, technology, and application areas that this encompasses, which include for example data sonification, auditory wayfinding, auditory graphs, speech interfaces, virtual environments, and associated perceptual, cognitive, technical, and technological research and development.  Many of the interdisciplinary research and development efforts are of direct relevance to persons with perceptual disabilities, especially visual impairments; for example, developing wayfinding systems for the blind requires research into effective distance cues and object identifiers used in auditory displays.  Research into the efficacy of auditory graphs may be used to help visually impaired students and scientists participate more fully in science.  Even household devices can have more effective auditory displays that provide richer information than the basic ""beeps"" they presently tend to generate.  A common approach in this field is universal design, wherein a display strategy is developed once, to be used by all kinds of users, including those with and without specific access issues.  This year's conference theme is ""Sonification for Everyday Life""; more details about ICAD 2019 are available online at https://icad2019.icad.org/.  <br/><br/>The ICAD Think Tank is a doctoral consortium that promotes scholarship and networking among new researchers in this important emerging interdisciplinary area.  This full-day workshop will take place on June 23 immediately preceding the conference, The event will develop a supportive community of scholars and a spirit of collaborative research, by providing participants with a friendly and open, yet rigorous, scientific forum in which to present their research ideas, to listen to ongoing work from peer students, and to receive constructive feedback from a panel of distinguished experts.  Panel feedback is designed to help students understand and articulate how their work is positioned relative to related research, whether their topics are adequately focused for thesis research projects, whether their methods are correctly chosen and applied, and whether their results are appropriately analyzed and presented.  The Think Tank will also offer invited speakers and discussion groups (e.g., to provide students with relevant information about important issues for doctoral candidates, whether they are considering academic or industrial career paths).  Student participants will present their work via posters during the ICAD 2019 technical program, and via extended abstracts published on the ICAD 2019 website.  Thus, the Think Tank will help shape ongoing and future research projects that have clear and important implications for development of assistive technologies and universal access.  It will bring together students from diverse disciplines (such as engineering, computing, music, and psychology), so that they can experience the broad spectrum of approaches to auditory displays, assistive technologies and universal design. It will afford participants exposure to a larger community, allowing them to bond among themselves and with senior researchers at a critical stage in their professional development.  Because the students and faculty constitute a diverse group across a variety of dimensions, including nationality and culture, scientific discipline, and institution, the students' horizons are broadened to the future benefit of the field.  This year, the organizers expect that up to 6 U.S.-based Think Tank Scholars will have their travel and attendance heavily subsidized.  Some NSF funds will also be used to support travel by the faculty mentors (both U.S. and foreign-based), since they provide great value to the US students, but NSF funds will not be used to support travel and participation of non-U.S. students.  The organizers will be proactive in promoting diversity among the attendees; stage in their academic program, research topic, gender and disability status are examples of dimensions on which participant diversity will be pursued, while geographic and institutional diversity will also be strongly considered.  To further promote diversity among the Student Scholars, although up to two Scholars may be selected from a given university, only one may be funded by this grant.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is important  to understand the complexities of such work experiences because the workplace is a primary setting in which social group assimilation and integration occur.  Work also is the primary vehicle through which most people realize social opportunity and upward mobility.   Some workers make their religious affiliations visible through clothing and/or other aspects of personal appearance.   This project examines how the visibility of religious identities affects professional women and men in the workplace. This project has three goals.  First, the project will examine gendered differences in religious expression within the workplace. Second, it will determine how those who signify religious expression at work  navigate career advancement. Third, it will explore the strategies such workers use to accommodate/challenge workplace expectations that may be affected by their religious expression.  Findings from this research will help policy makers and employers create public policy and constructive workplace practices to address inequalities and discrimination based upon religious expression at work. As such, findings are relevant to enforcement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 that prohibits discrimination at many workplaces based on characteristics such as race, religion and sex.  <br/><br/>This project uses 60 qualitative interviews to compare three sets of employees in professional jobs:  20 women who signify religious affiliation at work, 20 women who do not signify religious affiliation at work, and 20 men who signify religious affiliation at work. Respondents will be drawn from a variety of professional fields, and identified through a combination of personal contacts and snowball sampling.  Interview questions include educational background, age, marital status, average hours worked, income, and work history.  Additional questions will probe for reasons behind their decisions to either signify or not signify religious identity at work.  Interview data will be subjected to open coding to derive themes present in the data using NVIVO to manage transcripts and data analysis.

The award to the University of the District of Columbia has potential broader impacts in a number of areas. The goal of this project is to develop the concept, model, simulate, and characterize a novel framework for predictive wind speed and wind-penetrated power systems making use of less precise existing models and associated outcomes. This will make important contributions to improving the methodology of probabilistic renewable energy forecasts.<br/><br/>The goal of the research is to develop a novel Bayesian approach to take into account the uncertainties inherent in the wind speed models due to variation among the locations of the wind turbines on a wind farm in a wind-penetrated power system; wind blow angle of attack at the hubs of the turbines in a wind farm; and variation among the distances between multiple dependent correlated wind farms and random loads in a wind-penetrated power system, simultaneously. Bayesian information will result in better decisions while it improves the characterization of wind speeds as it has lower variance in estimates, as well as less bias. The result will be better utilization of wind resources and less reliance on the need for thermal capacity  to be in service to compensate for wind variability. Furthermore, the goal is to present the application of proposed approaches to well-known power system problems such as stochastic economic dispatch, linearized AC optimal power flow, and security constraint unit commitment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, instructors must typically teach students about 3D molecules by using 2D images. As a result, many students have trouble grasping key elements of 3D macromolecular structure, including scale and the effects of molecular shape changes.  This project aims to address this limitation by developing an augmented reality (AR) application to visualize 3D macromolecules that are central to understanding biochemistry, cell biology, molecular biology, and genetics. AR is an interactive system in which a computer-generated 3D object is superimposed onto the physical environment. This project aims to develop a freely available AR-based application that can be installed on mobile smartphones and tablets and that can be used to visualize and manipulate macromolecules. The project seeks to implement the application in classes at two liberal arts colleges that include a combined total of ~100 students each year. It will also assess the impact of these AR-based teaching tools on student learning. Since the AR application will be freely available, it can enable the public to easily 'see' and interact with biological macromolecules that are important to human health. <br/><br/>To address the current gap in instructional tools available for teaching macromolecular structure, this project has three objectives: 1) Develop an application that uses AR technology to allow students and instructors to engage and interact with virtual 3D macromolecular structures; 2) Develop three learning modules on biochemistry topics of membrane transport (potassium channel), allosteric regulation (hemoglobin), active site catalysis (G-proteins); 3) Implement each learning module and evaluate its impacts in biochemistry courses taught by different instructors at different institutions. The project will evaluate the impacts of AR technology on both student learning outcomes and on potential changes to instructional practices in the classroom. The project aims to evaluate the effectiveness of the modules with respect to i) user experience with the technology; ii) impacts on student attitudes and visuospatial skills; and iii) impacts on instructional practices of using virtual 3D objects to teach macromolecular structure and function. During evaluation, the project will also develop and validate new instruments for effective assessment of the modules. The project aims to disseminate the AR applications through workshops for interested instructors and professional science educators, thus layin the groundwork for academic collaborations and community partnerships that can develop additional interactive AR modules. In addition to providing a novel tool for teaching molecular structure and function, the project will lay a strong foundational framework for the evaluation and development of additional AR-based teaching tools in the future.

Instead, plants cope by changing themselves, their final form or by delaying/accelerating the transition through phases in their lifecycle. Key to these coping strategies are small proteins that can move from one part of the plant to another, called florigen and antiflorigen. Florigen promotes more rapid development and flower formation, while antiflorigen has the opposite effect. The two regulators oppose each other and together act like a rheostat. What trajectory plants will eventually follow depends on the relative abundance of florigen to antiflorigen, which in turn is controlled by temperature, daylength and other cues. How does the balance of florigen and antiflorigen change plant form or the rate of its developmental transitions? Addressing this question has been hampered by technical challenges, florigen and antiflorigen can modulate accumulation of other key regulators; but, do not bind DNA to change transcription. The principal investigators have overcome these challenges and can now dissect where in the plant these developmental choice decisions are made, the precise processes put in place by antiflorigen and how it opposes florigen. Insights gained from these studies will be of broad general interest both by advancing understanding of the activity of these important regulators and by impacting agriculture. Traits modulated by florigen and antiflorigen in different crop species include such key agronomical traits such as tuberization, bulb formation, tree bud set and bud burst, seed dormancy, photoperiod-dependent flowering and flower architecture.<br/><br/>This project will leverage state-of the-art genetic, genomic, biochemical and cell biological approaches to provide mechanistic insight into the transcriptional pathways regulated by antiflorigen (TFL1), its repressive activity and the site of competitive action with florigen (FT). Specifically, imaging and genetic studies will probe whether FT, like TFL1, accumulates in and controls fate of axillary meristems. Standard and cell type specific RNAseq combined with network analyses will identify the pathways and the key components in each directly repressed by TFL1/FD. Finally, dual affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry (conducted in laboratory course) will uncover proteins that interact with and shape activity of the TFL1 complex. The combined activities will provide novel mechanistic insight into the question how key regulators of plant form and function execute their roles. The broader impacts, besides training of undergraduate students, graduate students and postdocs in independent research, will include mentoring of female scientists and training of 40 undergraduate students in research in laboratory courses. Students in two authentic research lab courses will conduct dual affinity purification combined with mass spectrometry, interpret the results and conduct follow-up experiments of their design. Finally, a lecture on research conducted in this proposal will be given to high school students during a summer research academy at Penn. Graduate students involved in the project will lead summer research academy lab sections, workshops and boot camps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Metals and alloys are the workhorse materials for the manufacturing industry and structural applications. This is mainly because they have a good balance of strength, a metal's resistance to deformation and failure, and ductility, a metal's ability to undergo irreversible deformation before rupture. Usually there is a strength-ductility tradeoff, a gain in strength in a material is inevitably accompanied by a sacrifice in ductility. High entropy alloys are a new class of materials that contain nearly equal numbers of atoms of five or more different elements. Their unconventional concentrated multiple element compositions hold promise for achieving an exceptional combination of strength and ductility. However, the fundamental mechanisms that control the strength and ductility in high entropy alloys down to the atomic scale remain largely unexplored. This project focuses on investigation of the microscopic deformation mechanisms in high entropy alloys. Effects of the composition fluctuations on deformation processes mediated by defects in the periodic arrangement of atoms in the alloy will be studied by computer simulations on the scale of atoms; the results will be further compared with experiments. The physical insights gained will be important for guiding the future development of new high entropy alloys with a superior strength-ductility combination. The project will foster collaborations between theory and experiment. Educational activities will offer opportunities to introduce students to computer modeling techniques for simulating materials and to inspire students to pursue careers in science and engineering.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>This award supports theoretical and computational research and education to advance the fundamental understanding of deformation mechanisms in high entropy alloys. Strength and ductility are among the most important mechanical properties of metals and alloys for engineering applications. High entropy alloys contain high concentrations of five or more different elements in near equiatomic proportions. The mechanisms controlling the strength and ductility of high entropy alloys remain poorly understood. This project is focused on understanding the mechanistic role of short-range clusters in the strain hardening and tensile ductility of face-centered cubic high entropy alloys. Multi-component interatomic potentials will be used to perform molecular dynamics and atomistic reaction pathway simulations for studying the dislocation pinning and cross-slip processes mediated by short-range clusters. Effects of stress, temperature, cluster size and density will be investigated. The modeling results will be compared with experimental characterizations of dislocation mechanisms and deformation microstructures. The insights gained are important for harnessing the short-range clusters to achieve a superior strength-ductility combination in high entropy alloys. The project will introduce advanced modeling techniques to students. The research results will be incorporated into a high-school course module as well as a graduate course on micromechanics. Undergraduate students will be involved in the research.

For example, the principal investigators will determine how the shape and structure of tulip poplar leaves enhance cooling on nearly-stagnant hot summer days while also reducing drag in tropical storm or even hurricane force winds. The models and tools developed in this project will also be applied to determine under what conditions the waving motion of seagrass augments waste removal and enhances photosynthesis. The scientific results of this project will inform the selection of plants that can survive extreme environmental conditions, including low levels of CO2, high temperatures, or strong wind and wave forces. The significance of the proposed also work extends beyond gaining insight into mechanical adaptation of plants in the natural world. The physical principals discovered could drive innovations in the engineering design of flexible structures such as sails, flags, and cables. Furthermore, the computational tools developed in this project will find immediate application in other systems where exchange occurs across flexible structures in air and water, including gas exchange in the lungs, odor capture and pheromone release in a variety of animals, nutrient uptake in the gut, and heat loss in appendages.<br/><br/>Flexible plants, fungi, and sessile animals are thought to reconfigure in strong wind and floodwaters to reduce the drag acting upon them. In fast flows, for example, leaves roll up into cone shapes that reduce flutter and drag when compared to paper cutouts of similar shape and flexibility. In light breezes and currents, leaf flutter can be beneficial to heat dissipation and gas exchange. It is not clear how the shape and mechanical structure of broad leaves results in different passive movements across this range of flows. The specific goals of this project are to determine the mechanisms by which 1) single leaves flutter in low winds and flows and roll up into drag reducing shapes in strong flows, 2) leaf flutter enhances heat dissipation and photosynthesis in light winds and flows, and 3) some leaves, such as the touch-me-not, actively reconfigure by changes in turgor pressure initiated by electrical signaling. A combination of numerical simulations and laboratory experiments with real and artificial leaves will be used to quantify both passive and active movements as well as the concentrations of gases and heat. The fluid-structure interaction problem will be solved using the immersed boundary and inviscid vortex sheet methods. A new immersed boundary-style method for modeling the leaf as a source or sink of gases or heat will be developed. Hyperelastic material models will be developed and implemented in the immersed boundary framework to determine how strain-softening or strain-hardening elasticity affects leaf performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award to the University of the District of Columbia (UDC) has potential broader impacts in a number of areas. The goal of the project is to advance the fundamental understanding of robustness as a performance indicator for geotechnical infrastructures and establish an informed decision support framework for robust management of earthen levees against multiple hazards. The research will be integrated into geotechnical engineering courses at UDC.<br/><br/>The project will develop a robust management methodology to address the infrastructure robustness under multiple hazards and advance the state-of-practice in adaptive management of geotechnical infrastructures. The cornerstones of the robust management methodology are three tightly integrated concepts: engineering robustness against multiple hazards, Bayesian inference, and multi-objective based decision-support. Firstly, an original quantitative robustness metric will be formulated for assessing the capability of earthen levees to withstand hazard events such as floods and earthquakes. Then a novel probabilistic framework will be established for robustness and reliability assessment of earthen levees. Finally, an intelligent decision support framework will be created to turn numerical simulation results and performance data into robust management capability. The research is expected to fill a knowledge gap in geotechnical engineering by transforming the robustness concept into an effective decision support tool for geotechnical infrastructure management. The results of the research will lead to an innovative solution for resilient geotechnical infrastructures in the face of uncertainty, which can protect the public and benefit society through safer engineering practice for risk reduction and mitigation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is expected that the award helps to further the faculty member's research capability and effectiveness, improves research and teaching at the home institution, and involves undergraduate students in research experiences. The award to Xavier University of Louisiana seeks to synthesize and characterize solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) phosphonium ionene in lithium-ion batteries as an alternative source of energy. Additionally, the project will provide research training to a diverse population of undergraduate students in the field of polymer science. <br/><br/>Solid polymer electrolyte (SPE) membranes have the potential to improve the safety of lithium ion batteries by eliminating the potential for catastrophic battery failure due to lithium dendrite formation in solvent-based electrolyte formulations. Because they act as both the electrode separator and the lithium ion transport medium, SPEs have the potential to enhance lithium ion transport leading to extended lifetimes of lithium ion electrochemical cells. The overarching goal of this proposed research is to develop new polyelectrolyte SPEs for lithium ion batteries that are based on phosphonium ionenes. The PI intends to employ phosphonium ionenes in lithium ion batteries for the first time and directly study the impact of localized segmental motion on lithium ion transport through SPEs. This will be achieved by synthesizing and characterizing a library of phosphonium ionenes and segmented phosphonium ionenes with variable charge density distribution and chain flexibility. The outcomes will contribute to the overall state-of-knowledge in the field by providing essential data towards understanding the role of polyelectrolyte charge density and polymer chain segmental motion on lithium ion transport in all-solid-state batteries. Further, an essential educational impact of this work includes engaging undergraduate students who are historically underrepresented in the field of polymer chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Compared to existing brain imaging technologies, the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) helmet brain imager overcomes limitations related to radioactive dose, portability, motion tolerance and cost. The lower dose required by the device permits screening or longitudinal monitoring of patients in various cases, such as brain injury, Alzheimer's, epilepsy, stroke rehabilitation, Parkinson's disease, addition and other neurological and mental health disorders. The portable nature allows bedside imaging directly in patient rooms, as well as onsite imaging in military and athletic settings, including immediately after head injuries. The device's motion tolerance helps address hospital inefficiency and extra cost from rescanning patients due to movement artifacts, and the discomfort of remaining still, especially for elderly and injured patients. The low cost and small footprint compared to standard PET/CT systems, results in a device with utility beyond just large medical facilities, as it can be used in smaller rural clinics, sporting/military medical facilities, and in research studies of previously difficult to study brain functions.<br/><br/>This I-Corps Project will help bring the Positron Emission Tomography (PET) Helmet brain imager into use by clinics, sporting/ army medical centers, and research institutions. The instrument is a ring of detectors that can be placed around the head of a patient to non-invasively provide information of activity in different brain regions. This device requires only 10-25% of the typical clinical PET radiation dose due to the close proximity of the detectors to the patient's head, and published data show high efficiency and sensitivity of the detectors using industry standard testing. Moreover, the PET Helmet system can be transported to the desired location of imaging scanner, and a current research project involves testing the imager bedside for human patients with traumatic brain injury. The device moves with the head of the patient allowing for motion tolerance as well as upright imaging, and we have demonstrated appropriate task-related brain imaging during an upright walking task in human participants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given the aging of U.S. populations, and the prevalence of dementia in elderly patients, patients with cognitive impairment will be an increasing management problem in healthcare systems. This project's information system will allow primary care providers to manage complex cognitively impaired cases without needing a referral to specialists, and without needing additional provider time with patients. Primary care providers generally manage simple cases of mild cognitive impairment, and refer more complex cases to neurologists, neuropsychologists, and geriatric specialists, which can cause economic and patient-care problems. Specialty care for cognitively impaired individuals can also be sparse outside of major metropolitan areas, which causes serious challenges to the equitable delivery of health care for rural and underserved communities. Primary care providers would potentially benefit with increased revenue and better care of the patients. Patients would potentially benefit from their care being managed by fewer physicians, and have more rapid access to diagnosis and treatment. Society will potentially benefit from lower population-health costs and improved healthcare outcomes.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project proposes to develop an information system to manage patients with cognitive impairment by providing primary care providers with an integrated set of evidence-based screening, diagnostic, treatment and monitoring modules. These modules will include a diagnostic test for cognitive impairment based upon computer-analyzed electroencephalography (EEG) data using a new technique based upon preliminary results. Because of its low cost, rapidity, and non-invasive nature, EEG has great promise as an office-based clinical test for brain diseases. However, to date, standard techniques of EEG analysis have not been accurate enough for routine clinical use. Similarly, currently, there are no tests that are FDA-approved for assessing cognitive impairments associated with brain diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease. Another strong component of this envisioned information management system will be its recommendation of care plans personalized for each patient based on artificial intelligence-based models. In addition, the information management software will have the ability to connect the patient to other local services that are often needed by patients with dementia and other brain diseases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because the intensity of cosmic rays hitting Earth is not uniform, it is important to place neutron monitors at multiple locations to form a complete picture of cosmic rays in space.  Neutron monitors are capable of detecting Solar Energetic Particles (SEPs) as well as background neutrons produced by the ever-present Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCR).  They produce decades-long records of stable and reliable cosmic ray intensity measurements.  Furthermore, observations from wide-spread networks of monitors can be analyzed to provide high-time resolution measurements of the most energetic and powerful of solar particle events, Ground Level Enhancements (GLEs).  The University of Delaware (UD) neutron monitors have suffered from lack of external funding over the past few years, and they are currently minimally supported through institutional funds (from the UD and the Bartol Research Institute).  However, this funding will end in July of 2019, and plans are in place to dismantle the stations beginning of June, 2019, unless external funding can be secured.  The purpose of this one-year RAPID project is to restore the North American network to a functional condition and support operation for one year until longer term support can be secured.<br/><br/>The historic neutron monitor data have shown that at each station the count rate varies with the solar activity cycle.  This is the phenomenon of solar modulation of galactic cosmic rays.  To investigate the origin of the phenomenon, one cannot rely on the count rates of one neutron monitor: hence, one needs to derive the cosmic ray intensity as a function of particle energy or particle rigidity.  Since each neutron monitor is sensitive to primary cosmic rays above some geomagnetic cutoff rigidity, one can combine measurements of stations at different latitudes.  The reliability, stability and robustness of multi-decade measurements is critical for understanding the variability of the Sun.   Of particular interest is the fact that the GCR intensity during the last two solar minimum is the greatest over the period covered by the observations by a significant factor.  This would not have been known without neutron monitors.  The current network of North American neutron monitors, combined with Russian operated stations are strategically located to provide precise, real-time, 3-dimensional measurements of the cosmic-ray angular distribution. Because of the combined effects of Earth's magnetic field and atmosphere, high latitude sites have superior directional sensitivity relative to low latitude sites.  At the high latitude sites, where the UD's neutron monitors are located, the SEPs are in-focus, while cosmic rays arriving at low and mid latitude stations arrive from widely dispersed directions.  The complete network of high latitude neutron monitors allows a complete picture of when, where, and from what direction SEPs strike Earth.<br/><br/>In addition to space weather forecasting, data from neutron monitors, such as those to be collected during this one-year RAPID project, are also used in support of other science investigations, beyond studies of cosmic rays and heliospheric physics.  One use of neutron monitor data is to monitor the flux of neutrons produced by cosmic rays for a broad range of practical applications, including detecting nuclear threats for homeland and national security, calculating the radiation dose to airplane crews and passengers, understanding the rate of single-event upsets (soft errors) in microelectronic devices, measuring soil and snow moisture content, and calculating the production rate of cosmogenic radionuclides used for atmospheric tracers and nuclear treaty verification.  For all these applications, neutrons and other secondary particles produced in the atmosphere and surface materials by galactic cosmic rays (and occasionally by solar particles) are either the source of the effect or an important background.<br/><br/>This one-year RAPID project will provide an educational experience for an undergraduate student to help maintain and calibrate the neutron monitor station in Newark, Delaware.  The research agenda of this RAPID project supports the Strategic Goals of the AGS Division in discovery, learning, diversity, and interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will do so by recruiting undergraduate STEM majors and STEM professionals and preparing them to become STEM teachers.  In partnership with Pittsburgh Public Schools, Carlow University seeks to prepare 26 highly effective biology, chemistry, and mathematics secondary education teachers. The secondary education program in STEM at Carlow University is a five-year, master's degree program.  Consequently, STEM majors in their junior year and STEM professionals will be recruited to enter the program.  The STEM majors will receive three years of scholarship support as they complete a baccalaureate degree and a master's degree in secondary education.  The STEM professionals will receive one year of support as they complete a master's degree in secondary education. The Noyce Scholars will have multiple opportunities to engage in experiential learning, with an emphasis on developing computational thinking skills.  These learning opportunities include workshops, and weeklong courses.  Their teaching skills will be enhanced with training about restorative justice practices and culturally responsive teaching to prepare them to teach successfully in high-need classrooms.  Successful passage of the Noyce Scholars into teaching careers will be supported by a team of advisors that includes STEM and education mentors, a teacher-mentor from Pittsburgh Public Schools, and a coach that works with the Scholar from enrollment through the first three years of teaching.<br/><br/>The project intends to recruit and enroll 12 biology, chemistry, and mathematics undergraduates as Noyce Scholars between 2019-21 and 14 STEM professionals between 2019-23.  To help prepare the Noyce Scholars to be successful in supporting diverse learners in high-need school districts, the Carlow University program will include coursework that includes issues of social justice, positive behavioral supports, restorative justice practices in schools, culturally responsive pedagogy, universal design, individualized learning, trauma-informed teaching practices, classroom design and instructional techniques to support students with disabilities, and content specific literacy practices to support English Language Learners.  Noyce Scholars with complete practicums and student teaching in Pittsburgh Public Schools.  The project will develop, apply, and assess best practices in experiential learning, with an emphasis on computational thinking, which is a method of problem solving developed in computer science that has a broad application across disciplines.  It involves the applicable concepts of decomposition of large problems into smaller parts, abstraction of relevant pieces, identification of similarities to already solved problems, and development of algorithms.  Results of project evaluation and research activities should generate new knowledge that will contribute to best practices in recruiting and preparing highly effective STEM teachers for careers in high-need schools. The research study intends to address gaps in the literature about the impact of computational thinking training on the effectiveness of pre-service teachers, on secondary education, and whether pre-service and in-service coaching enhances teacher proficiency in computational thinking.  Carlow University is a longstanding member of large local educational consortia in the region, which will enable swift and comprehensive dissemination of project findings.  The program has the potential to help address the high-need STEM teaching shortages in the local community and region.  The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The key technology is based on the controlled release of chemo-drugs in response to tumor acidosis. The initial product is an acid-sensitive prodrug of Doxorubicin (Dox). Dox is a prominent chemo-drug commonly used in the treatment of breast, bladder, and other cancers (including the childhood cancers Wilms tumor and neuroblastoma). The current global annual market for Dox is ~$800M (~$400M in the US). Treatments of solid tumors that are likely to be acidic account for ~60-70% of Dox applications in the clinic. The Dox global market is projected to reach $1.38B by 2024. This pH-sensitive prodrug of Dox may be considered an improved version of Dox for treating acidic solid tumors. Also, this technology could be expanded to other chemo-drugs outside of the anthracycline class. Furthermore, acidic microenvironments are found not only in cancerous tumors, but also in other disease states, such as sites of inflammation and the ischemic myocardium during heart attacks, which represent other potential targets of the pH-sensitive prodrug technology in the future.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project aims to develop a technology for improving the safety profile of chemo-drugs by suppressing drug release at healthy tissues, while preferentially releasing drugs at tumor sites. The targeted drug release would be triggered by tumor acidosis. Due to rapid growth, many cancerous tumors have extracellular pH (pHe) in the range of 6.5-6.9, compared with pHe of 7.2-7.4 in healthy tissues. Tumor acidosis can be considered as a universal biomarker of the cancer microenvironment and correlates with poor prognosis (i.e., more acidic tumors are usually found in more aggressive cancers). To turn tumor acidosis against cancer, this team developed ultra-acid-sensitive, small molecule prodrugs to selectively release Dox in response to acidic tumor pHe. The critical challenge of developing an ultra-sensitive pH biosensor that can distinguish between pHe 7.4 and 6.7 has been met from the basic science side by using an acid-sensitive linker. Preliminary data indicate that these prodrugs can release ~ 4-fold more Dox at pH 6.7 vs. 7.4 in cell culture settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The NSF Division of Materials Research (DMR) funds this award, which supports research and educational activities focused on the dynamics of materials failure. Designing safe and robust materials for transportation, energy storage, or biomedical implants requires a basic understanding of crack propagation that is the most common mode of materials failure.  <br/><br/>This project is aimed at understanding how cracks propagate in brittle materials such as glass, ceramics, and some polymeric materials and metals, which typically fracture abruptly. While traditional fracture mechanics predicts that brittle cracks should rapidly accelerate along a straight path to reach the speed at which sound travels over a flat surface, cracks are experimentally observed to reach less than half of that speed. For reasons that are not fundamentally understood, crack propagation becomes dynamically unstable, thereby causing cracks to strongly deviate from a straight path and preventing them from reaching their sonic limiting speed. This research will center on using computation and models to produce a more complete picture of unstable crack propagation in brittle materials for various fracture geometries investigated experimentally and different materials structures and properties. <br/>   <br/>Basic insights into dynamic fracture instabilities are expected to improve our fundamental theoretical understanding of materials failure, contributing to both further developments of computational methods and the theory of cracks.

The NSF Division of Materials Research funds this award that supports research and education on crack propagation, a topic of both fundamental and practical interest. While the classical theory of linear elastic fracture mechanics predicts that cracks in brittle materials should smoothly accelerate to their sonic limiting velocity, cracks are widely observed to develop dynamic instabilities before reaching this velocity. Depending on the onset velocity of instability and dimensionality, instabilities can be varied and complex. They may manifest as facet formation, micro-branching, crack tip oscillations or tip splitting. Despite their fundamental importance and apparent similarities to other interfacial pattern instabilities in condensed-matter physics and materials science, how dimensionality and material properties, such as elastic nonlinearity and heterogeneities, individually or jointly contribute to produce those dynamic fracture instabilities remains poorly understood.<br/><br/>The PIs propose to combine novel theoretical and computational approaches to understand at a fundamental level the mechanisms and interrelations of varied dynamic fracture instabilities. Computational studies will exploit the phase-field approach, which describes the short-scale physics of failure and macroscopic elasticity within a self-consistent set of equations that can be used to simulate complex crack paths and to establish quantitative benchmark comparisons with experiments. Simulations will be guided, and their results interpreted, by further development of a theory of cracks that accounts for elastic nonlinearity. Studies will center on investigating the role of dimensionality, heterogeneities, and nonlinearity in dynamic instabilities, helping to address largely unanswered questions such as: Why do cracks accelerate to nearly their sonic speeds in quasi two-dimensional (2D) geometries, but become unstable in the form of facet formation or micro-branching at much lower speed in 3D geometries? Are 3D instabilities due to the increased dimensionality of the crack front from a point in 2D to a line in 3D, or does nucleation of a facet or micro-branch require the interaction of the crack front with a localized heterogeneity? Does elastic nonlinearity and its associated emergent length scale, recently shown by phase-field simulations to play a key role in the oscillatory instability of high speed cracks in 2D, play a role in 3D instabilities? Moreover, how are facet formation and micro-branching related? Simulation results will be quantitatively compared to experimental observations in brittle gels, which provide unique capability to visualize in situ crack front dynamics in 2D and 3D during the fracture process. <br/><br/>Basic insights into dynamic fracture instabilities are expected to improve our fundamental theoretical understanding of materials failure, contributing to both further developments of the phase-field method and the theory of cracks that may help predict the failure of a wide range of natural, technological, and geophysical brittle materials. In addition, this project offers unique opportunities for engaging and training the next generation of scientists through K-12 school outreach activities and graduate-level teaching material developed and shared by the PIs in the US and Israel, which use simple experiments, teaching modules, and projects to convey the excitement of understanding how things break.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

AI/ML have revolutionized several technical industries such as voice recognition, image processing, healthcare, and personalized advertisements. AI/ML operates by training a mathematical model, often a combination of non-linear functions, to make inferences about the model's environment. However, AI/ML has been primarily restricted to cloud-based applications with large quantities of computing resources. In contrast, this technology implements the AI/ML model as hardware circuit that fits within a single integrated circuit. This project builds off previous technical accomplishments that implemented software design principles, such as extensibility, service-oriented architecture, modularity, and loose coupling, in hardware design through software assisted compilation. Creating a software aid to automatically restructure the hardware design enabled the hardware to change much more dynamically according to a series of parameters. By applying similar techniques to AI/ML, the technology will be able deconstruct and analyze the AI/ML model, and through a series of algorithms construct a matching hardware circuit.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through a series of five conferences over fourteen months, this cohesive, focused professional development series will convene approximately 100 Noyce pre- and in-service secondary STEM teachers, and other Philadelphia-area STEM teachers.  Through the conference activities, these participants will gain the understanding and skills needed to ""Integrate STEM in Everyday Life,"" the primary theme of the year-long work.  It is anticipated that implementing a ""STEM in Everyday Life"" approach will increase the success of students in STEM classes.<br/><br/>The conference series aims to partner pre-service and in-service teachers to develop non-traditional curriculum units that are both inquiry-based and place-based, using the students' cultural and physical environment as the source of student research and data collection.  Educators will be supported in thinking intentionally about areas of their students' lives in which learning STEM concepts would be highly motivating.  Examples of such areas include sports, food and nutrition, health and safety, music, and transportation.  The workshop participants will design and develop learning experiences that engage their students in exploring how STEM concepts and practices intersect with language arts, history, and fine arts, as well as how STEM affects their lives and influences their decisions.  In this conference series, teachers will be challenged to develop engaging place-based, project-based units that not only align with the Next Generation Science Standards and the Common Core State Standards, but also to place STEM teaching in socio-scientific and cultural contexts.  In addition to the member institutions of the PRNP, this project will reach out to institutions of higher education in the Philadelphia region who have not had Noyce programs and introduce students and faculty from these institutions to the Noyce network.  Furthermore, the project will disseminate what is learned through this work in publications and presentations at national professional meetings.  This project has the potential to advance instructional skills of teachers in developing and implementing placed-based curricular units that use the surrounding communities as their laboratories.  Thus, learning environments can be extended from inside school walls into the community, while simultaneously bringing cultural and community stakeholders into the world of schools.  This interchange has the potential to open new relationships within each community along STEM, cultural, and community lines.

The goal of the project is to create a student-centered online learning system that has the the potential to allow every student to select and engage with learning resources that best suit their own backgrounds and learning needs.  In this way, the online learning system could provide a personalized learning experience at a large scale.  In addition, by enabling instructors to collaboratively design, create, share, and improve instructional resources, the project aims to develop the personalized online learning system without increasing (and possibly reducing) the cost of higher education for students. This online learning system may be most beneficial to first-generation college students, students from rural communities and from groups that are underrepresented in college, adult learners, and others who may be less prepared to succeed in college and who face significant financial or other difficulties in pursuit of higher education. <br/><br/>At the core of the project is creation of an Online Learning for Mastery (OLM) system, which will be designed by combining the latest online learning technology with the concept of ""mastery learning"" design. Mastery Learning breaks down a topic into a sequence of learning modules that each contain formative assessment, instruction, and practice.  This approach enables students to move through the material at their own pace.  The OLM system will consist of multiple sequences of learning modules, with each module combining instructional resources with formative assessment, allowing students who have already mastered the content to quickly move ahead, while providing struggling students ample support and opportunities to catch up at their own pace. The OLM system has the potential to produce a large amount of data on each student's learning process. These data have better interpretability than what is collected from conventional online learning platforms. The project aims to develop analysis algorithms to extract rich information about student learning behavior and learning difficulties from the data.  The data, in turn, will guide instructors and researchers in developing new instructional materials and platform features to help students become better self-regulated and motivated learners. The process is akin to civil engineers designing highway systems and safety features based on analysis of traffic data collected from GPS systems. The data collection capability of the OLM system serves as such a ""learning GPS"" for both instructors and students. Results from the project have the potential to contribute significant new knowledge to our understanding of student learning behavior in a self-paced online STEM learning environment, and to inform effective instructional designs to facilitate a student's learning process. The project proposes to create two online courses. The first course will be an online introductory college physics course serving as the online component of multiple blended format courses at the University of Central Florida. This course could potentially be shared between multiple institutions including six local state colleges in the Orlando area. The second course will be a development course designed for instructors, introducing them to the latest online learning technologies and research findings related to OLM and mastery learning, while attempting to build a community of instructors for creating, improving, sharing, and reusing OLM modules.  This project has the potential not only to increase knowledge about effective online education but also to broaden participation in STEM fields by reducing education cost, increasing accessibility, and supporting multiple pathways to a STEM degree.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the conditions influencing the relevant male and female mating decisions generating these patterns are currently unclear. Systematic behavioral and hormonal data will be collected from wild olive baboons to test whether two recognized aggressive tactics are effective male strategies in either the long-term or the short-term. Correspondingly, this research will evaluate whether males obtain mating opportunities through the contrasting strategy of friendly interaction to females, either as part of a long-term strategy of positive social affiliation or as a short-term tactic. This project also will record female injuries and non-invasively measure stress hormones to evaluate the physiological response and potential costs to females of male strategies.

Replacement of volatile, flammable liquid electrolytes now used in lithium ion batteries with safe solid electrolytes is the goal of many existing and future battery technologies. The development of such a solid electrolyte separator has broad applications in many economic sectors and to companies developing lithium ion, lithium metal, lithium sulfur (LiS) and lithium air batteries. The technology can be applicable to many lithium ion conducting ceramics, protecting them from contact with lithium metal and water, and enabling them to be bonded with polymer electrolytes, so that composites can be formed that are processible and compatible with existing manufacturing processes or technologies to make batteries.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project addresses several critical problems that hinder the development of all solid state lithium batteries. It is a technology that merges the beneficial characteristics of both lithium ion conducting ceramics and organic polymer electrolytes. Lithium ion conducting ceramics can have high conductivity, wide electrochemical stability windows and moduli that in principle suppress the growth of dendrites, but are brittle and not easily incorporated into full cells. Polymer electrolytes have good processibility, can be easily incorporated into battery cells and have better compatibility with electrodes, but have low ionic conductivity. The technology merges these two materials using silica ""glue"" that adheres well to the ceramic and can be functionalized to be compatible with the polymer component.

For example, the principal investigators will determine how the shape and structure of tulip poplar leaves enhance cooling on nearly-stagnant hot summer days while also reducing drag in tropical storm or even hurricane force winds. The models and tools developed in this project will also be applied to determine under what conditions the waving motion of seagrass augments waste removal and enhances photosynthesis. The scientific results of this project will inform the selection of plants that can survive extreme environmental conditions, including low levels of CO2, high temperatures, or strong wind and wave forces. The significance of the proposed also work extends beyond gaining insight into mechanical adaptation of plants in the natural world. The physical principals discovered could drive innovations in the engineering design of flexible structures such as sails, flags, and cables. Furthermore, the computational tools developed in this project will find immediate application in other systems where exchange occurs across flexible structures in air and water, including gas exchange in the lungs, odor capture and pheromone release in a variety of animals, nutrient uptake in the gut, and heat loss in appendages.<br/><br/>Flexible plants, fungi, and sessile animals are thought to reconfigure in strong wind and floodwaters to reduce the drag acting upon them. In fast flows, for example, leaves roll up into cone shapes that reduce flutter and drag when compared to paper cutouts of similar shape and flexibility. In light breezes and currents, leaf flutter can be beneficial to heat dissipation and gas exchange. It is not clear how the shape and mechanical structure of broad leaves results in different passive movements across this range of flows. The specific goals of this project are to determine the mechanisms by which 1) single leaves flutter in low winds and flows and roll up into drag reducing shapes in strong flows, 2) leaf flutter enhances heat dissipation and photosynthesis in light winds and flows, and 3) some leaves, such as the touch-me-not, actively reconfigure by changes in turgor pressure initiated by electrical signaling. A combination of numerical simulations and laboratory experiments with real and artificial leaves will be used to quantify both passive and active movements as well as the concentrations of gases and heat. The fluid-structure interaction problem will be solved using the immersed boundary and inviscid vortex sheet methods. A new immersed boundary-style method for modeling the leaf as a source or sink of gases or heat will be developed. Hyperelastic material models will be developed and implemented in the immersed boundary framework to determine how strain-softening or strain-hardening elasticity affects leaf performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although these properties, such as internal temperature, density, grain size, and layer thickness, are highly relevant to studies of Antarctic climate, ice-sheet dynamics, and mass balance, their measurement currently relies on sparse in-situ surveys under challenging weather conditions. Sensors on polar-orbiting satellites can observe the entire Antarctic every few days during their years-long lifetime. Consequently, the approaches developed in this study, when coupled with the advancing technologies of small and low-cost CubeSats, aim to contribute to Antarctic science and lead to cost-effective, convenient, and accurate long-term analyses of the Antarctic system while reducing the human footprint on the continent. Moreover, the project will be solely based on publicly-available datasets; thus, while contributing to interdisciplinary undergraduate and graduate research and education at the grantee's institution, the project will also encourage engagement of citizen scientists through its website. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to characterize Antarctic firn layers in terms of their thickness, physical temperature, density, and grain size through multi-frequency microwave radiometer measurements from space. Electromagnetic penetration depth changes with frequency in ice; thus, multi-frequency radiometers are able to profile firn layer properties versus depth. To achieve its objective, the project will utilize the Global Precipitation Measurement (GPM) satellite constellation as a single multi-frequency microwave radiometer system with 11 frequency channels observing the Antarctic Ice Sheet. Archived in-situ measurements of Antarctic firn density, grain size, temperature, and layer thickness will be collected and separated into training and test datasets. Microwave emissions simulated using the training data will be compared to GPM constellation measurements to evaluate and improve state-of-the-art forward microwave emission models. Based on these models, the project will develop numerical retrieval algorithms for the thermal and physical properties of Antarctic firn. Results of retrievals will be validated using the test dataset, and uncertainty and error analyses will be conducted. Lastly, changes in the thermal and physical characteristics of Antarctic firn will be examined through long-term retrieval studies exploiting GPM constellation measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pronin of the Department of Chemistry at the University of California Irvine. Professor Pronin and his students are developing new methods for the direct conversion of compounds that contain a double bond between two carbon atoms (i.e., alkenes) to compounds that contain nitrogen (amines), a oxygen-hydrogen groups (alcohols), and their derivatives. The reaction conditions are mild and use environmentally-abundant materials, making the new synthetic routes attractive for conserving both energy and critical elements. These new molecules are valuable chemicals used extensively in industry, especially the pharmaceutical industry.  The chemical transformations being studied are a long-standing challenge in the field of organic chemistry. This research is taking advantage of underexplored patterns of chemical reactivity and producing new and general solutions to these problems. Professor Pronin's laboratory host ?Day at College? events as a part of the Laboratory Experiments and Activities in the Physical Sciences (LEAPS) program at UCI, which is aimed at educating middle school students about the opportunities that exist for them in the physical sciences. In collaboration with other faculty at UCI, the research team recruit and host students from a local community college with a large population of underrepresented minority students, Santiago Canyon College, for ten weeks during the summer to provide research experiences in the field of synthetic organic chemistry. This program is expected to increase awareness of minority students for STEM research and job opportunities.  The research is also providing a rich training ground for the next generation of chemists, generating opportunities for students from community colleges with limited engagement in chemistry research.<br/><br/>This research is leveraging radical-polar crossover reactivity and developing new enantioselective methods for the hydrofunctionalization of alkenes via earth-abundant cobalt species. These transformations combine facile hydrogen atom transfer events with oxidation of the resulting alkyl radicals and related intermediates to the corresponding carbocations or their synthetic equivalents. These species can then undergo reactions with nucleophiles to generate new functional groups. The combined process serves as an equivalent of Bronsted acid-catalyzed hydrofunctionalizations but proceeds in the absence of an acid. The exceptionally mild conditions of these reactions accommodate a broad substrate scope and facilitate development of the corresponding enantioselective reactions. Overall, this research is providing direct and general access to valuable scalemic building blocks from readily available starting materials and producing new knowledge of the fundamental reactivity of carbocations and related electrophilic intermediates.  The research is also providing a rich training ground for the next generation of chemists, generating opportunities for students from community colleges with limited engagement in chemistry research, and increasing awareness of middle school students to future career options in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The SIMuR project will engage U.S. undergraduate students in interdisciplinary research of historical and ongoing human-environmental interactions in the Shiraki Plateau in the southeastern part of the country of Georgia. The project will strengthen scientific knowledge, technical and leadership skills of a cohort of diverse, globally competent, and engaged young STEM researchers. This international research experience will embed students in a cross-country and cross-disciplinary research effort while getting them acquainted with the national specifics of this culturally-rich strategic region. SIMuR will increase STEM engagement and literacy in underserved communities in rural Georgia and the US, bringing advanced data science, visualization and spatial and temporal analysis concepts and technologies into this cross-country collaboration, thus improving the capacity of students and universities to address research problems of global significance.<br/><br/>Specifically, understanding the interplay of natural and anthropogenic factors in the history of human settlement on the Shiraki Plateau is a part of the interdisciplinary challenge of identifying and modeling impacts of human and environmental changes influencing the rise and decline of civilizations. With the goal of contributing to this developing body of knowledge, SIMuR will engage 15 undergraduate students from Bridgewater State University (5 students each year) in high-quality interdisciplinary research collaborations with Georgian peers and mentorship from an international group of experts in geological sciences, cyber-archaeology, computer engineering, information management, and data science. Participants will also engage in STEM outreach to underserved communities in southeastern Georgia and Massachusetts. Both the research and educational components of the project will build on a confluence of advanced technologies to clarify the several competing hypotheses of the depopulation of the Shiraki Plateau, the site of a recently discovered early civilization. The active reconsideration of the early human history of this area by the research community, and rapidly growing additional data from archaeological excavations and field observations in geology, hydrology, paleo-ecology and related fields, will make this an unprecedented opportunity for students to engage in the science debate, develop field research and analysis skills, and deepen their understanding of this rapidly developing culturally diverse area. By creating and disseminating findings in accessible online locations, the project will increase equitable access to authentic scientific data to scientists, educators, and underserved communities in US and throughout the world.

The research will address fundamental limitations in current data assimilation (DA) and uncertainty quantification for weather models.  The outcome from the research will have a tremendous impact on multi-disciplinary efforts that focus on these weather hazards, which will lead to sustained long-term reductions in forecast errors. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>The project will focus on 1) the development and testing of an advanced DA framework designed to eliminate specific assumptions currently used in practice; 2) the adoption of sophisticated uncertainty visualization schemes for exploring probabilistic information estimated from ensembles; and 3) the development of a DA research and educational module for class curriculum at the University of Maryland and external summer schools.<br/><br/>The project will adopt new Bayesian filtering techniques based on ""particle filters"".  The method uses samples of model simulations to represent probabilistic properties of model state variables conditioned on current and past observations. In addition to providing the most thorough investigation of particle filters for weather prediction, the research will apply the method for isolating sources of bias in models and observing systems. Another unique aspect of this work is its use of novel visualization techniques developed by statisticians and computer scientists.  These techniques form a set of analysis tools based on ""data depth,"" which allows for an insightful look at multivariate ensemble output via contour and curve boxplots. They also provide a means of verifying probabilistic quantities from ensembles with no assumptions for the underlying error distribution, thus aiding in the verification of non-parametric DA techniques, like particle filters.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>This research is motivated directly by hazardous weather events that affect the well-being of individuals in the United States and around the world. In addition to advancing predictive skill in numerical predictions, a portion of this work focuses on uncertainty quantification and visualization of ensemble datasets, which aims to improve the communication of severe weather risk to the public. DA advancements made during this work will be committed to the National Center for Atmospheric Research's Data Assimilation Research Testbed, a community software infrastructure for linking DA research to geoscientists. The project also includes a detailed strategy for developing an educational DA module for geoscience students and researchers.

Over the centuries, cryptography has advanced, from ad hoc secret codes that can be broken by hand, to methods based on number theory which remain secure even against adversaries using super-computers.  As algorithms from number theory have advanced, our codes for protecting data have also progressed in efficiency: NASA regularly transmits clear pictures of terrain on faraway planets, using error-correcting codes that cut through the noise of solar flares, cell phones, and radio transmissions. As our communication methods have evolved, we are naturally led to deep mathematical problems which must be solved before we can make further progress. Some of these problems are also deeply connected to central questions in complexity theory and new advances in optimization.<br/><br/>The investigators will focus on advanced techniques toward tackling central problems in circuit complexity and pseudo-randomness. In particular, they will apply recent advances in arithmetic geometry to the construction of new pseudo-random generators and new complexity lower bounds. One technique the investigators will pursue is their recent discovery of an efficient method to count solutions of polynomial equations over finite rings. This technique will help analyze a new family of pseudo-random generators with potentially better unpredictability than earlier constructions based on discrete logarithms and factoring. The research team will also use techniques from real and p-adic geometry to study the number of integer solutions to structured polynomials. The latter problem is one of the few recent methods with the potential to yield new lower bounds for circuit complexity and a better understanding of the P vs. NP question. In addition to this algorithmic research, the investigators will train graduate students, and use all work from this project to develop new content for courses and outreach programs for younger students.

At the BATS site however, despite the long history of observations, a mystery remains: When and how is enough nitrogen delivered to surface waters to support the biological production that is observed?  The investigators will use oxygen, nitrate, and micro-turbulence sensors on autonomous underwater gliders to sample continuously for twenty months at the BATS site in an effort to resolve this mystery. Gliders make it possible to measure processes at scales that can't be captured by monthly or biweekly sampling from a ship. Regular sampling by the BATS program will still be essential to the project, however, by providing opportunities for calibration and validation of the glider sensors as well as ship support for glider deployments and recoveries. The project will also leverage existing private funding from the BIOS-SCOPE project, a multi-institutional microbial marine biogeochemistry initiative at BATS, that will provide partial support for glider operations. The investigators will recruit and advise at least two NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) students each year, and will incorporate project themes and data into educational programs at their respective institutions. <br/><br/>This project will apply new technologies to address several factors believed to perpetuate significant underestimates of nitrate delivery and particulate organic carbon (POC) exports in the Sargasso Sea. High-resolution glider-based observations will be used to estimate annual net community production (ANCP) through oxygen mass balance, and new production (NP) through nitrate mass balance, over a period spanning an annual cycle and two consecutive oligotrophic periods. Microstructure measurements will provide much-needed profiles of vertical diffusivity to accurately constrain fluxes of oxygen and nitrate and their variability over the annual cycle. Oxygen/argon ratio measurements will be used as independent estimates of biologically mediated oxygen changes and as constraints on glider-measured rates of oxygen concentration change. Assessments of phytoplankton characteristics by flow cytometry will be used to calibrate the gliders' optical sensors to in situ biological characteristics, so that variability in phytoplankton community structure and biomass can be discerned at the gliders' high temporal resolution and related to simultaneously measured NCP, NP, and physical water column structure, both above and below the euphotic zone. POC exports will be inferred from backscatter inventories in the deeper layers. The sum of observations will enable assessments of relationships among three independently measured proxies for the strength of the biological carbon pump and how the system responds to environmental forcing over the annual cycle, with particular focus on the stratified oligotrophic months.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of DevOps is to enhance software productivity and reliability by shortening the software development life cycle while delivering features, fixes, and updates in close alignment with business objectives. The key to adopt the DevOps methodology is to automate the whole process of software configuration, build, testing, and deployment, so that they can be performed after any software code changes. Such automation requires developers to write comprehensive and complicated build scripts and maintain them frequently. Since build scripts often consist of heterogeneous code components and have significant dependency and impact on system environments, they raise unique challenges to traditional code analysis, defect detection, and repair techniques. This project targets an integrated suite of techniques supporting maintenance and quality assurance of build scripts, so that developers may have a similar level of confidence on their build scripts as on their source code. If successful, the project will lead to higher-quality build scripts, more productive build script maintenance, fewer delays in software integration process, as well as more robust software products, especially for those supporting different system environments and configurations. The project will also develop set-up tutorials for popular software frameworks based on analysis of their build scripts to help novice software developers learning the frameworks. <br/><br/>To overcome the challenges on analyzing and repairing build scripts, the project will develop (1) concolic analysis of build scripts which enables executions of build process under different system environments and configurations, (2) partial static analyses based on data collected during concolic analysis to detect defects in unexplored paths, and (3) techniques to repair build failures by learning script revisions from software projects with similar build configurations. During the development of above techniques, the project is expected to advance knowledge boundary in four ways. First, it will lead to better understanding of software build practice and common failures. Second, to address system-environment dependencies and impacts, the project will provide comprehensive knowledge on how build scripts interact with system environments, and develop novel symbolic operators, constraint solvers, and abstractions to support system-environment states in concolic and static analyses. Third, to address code heterogeneity, the project will reveal common correlation patterns among different components of build scripts and develop novel algorithms to transfer symbolic expressions and static analysis results across script boundaries via dynamic analyses. Fourth, the project will study the redundancy among build scripts revisions, system environments, configurations, and build logs from different projects, and develop techniques on summarizing common repair templates.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, an equally serious challenge soon awaits. Immediately after fertilization, the new embryo must rapidly remodel its surface so that additional sperm can no longer bind, and it must create an impenetrable barrier that will protect the embryo during development. The goal of this project is to explore protective barrier formation in the nematode worm, C. elegans, which offers several advantages over other organisms typically used to study this process (humans, mice, sea urchins). The work will be conducted entirely by undergraduate and high school students at Pomona College, a small liberal arts college dedicated to training the next generation of exceptional scientists. A diverse group of students in the investigator's research lab, as well as students in an Advanced Cell Biology course, will use genetic, biochemical, and cell biological approaches to investigate eggshell assembly in C. elegans. These studies will harness the power of C. elegans as a model system to explore both widely-conserved and species-specific strategies that contribute to protective barrier assembly in nematodes. Common features will lend insight into evolutionarily-conserved reproductive strategies, while species-specific features could identify new therapeutic targets to fight parasitic nematode infection of humans, plants, and animals. Importantly, this award will also create a mentorship pipeline for students historically underrepresented in science to support their persistence in STEM fields.<br/><br/>Before fertilization, the C. elegans vitelline layer (analogous to the mammalian zona pellucida, fish chorion, and sea urchin vitelline layer) forms on the oocyte surface and is comprised of at least three proteins with an interdependent relationship. CBD-1 functions at the top of the hierarchy and recruits PERM-2 and PERM-4, who in turn maintain each other's localization. Interestingly, CBD-1 also organizes a separate protein complex involved in fertilization and egg activation (the EGG complex). After fertilization, the PERM complex is remodeled into the outermost eggshell layer, while the EGG complex is internalized. Little is understood about the mechanism of vitelline layer remodeling, or how the relationships among vitelline layer proteins promote these events. In Aim 1 of this project, students will examine the interdependence of the PERM and EGG structural scaffolds at the oocyte surface before fertilization by analyzing null mutants and domain variants generated by CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing. In Aim 2, students will use biochemical and phenotypic analyses to investigate how PERM-2 and PERM-4 contribute to the structural and functional changes to the vitelline layer after fertilization. In Aim 3, they will explore whether similarities exist between nematode and mammalian vitelline layer structure and assembly. Together, these studies will provide mechanistic insight into conserved and divergent processes in protective barrier assembly across distantly-related phyla.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Strong spatial reasoning skills have been important to many of humanity's greatest advances in science and engineering.  To help teach these skills, this research will develop a display platform that is entirely different from all preceding 3D display technologies.  The display uses light to trap multiple particles in air, then moves and illuminates these trapped particles to draw 3D images.  We perceive these ""spatial images"" as physical objects because they are, in fact, physical objects in space. These full-color, high-definition images can be seen from every direction.  The technology makes possible, for the first time, many of the 3D images portrayed in science fiction.  In addition to the broader impacts for STEM education built directly into the primary research objective, a team of undergraduates under the supervision of the principal investigator (PI) will also design a 3D-centric Saturday academy called 'Spatial Forces' for middle and high school students from groups underrepresented in engineering, with a focus on low-income and rural students. These students will create interactive, revolving 3D content for a micro-museum aimed at exposing their communities to STEM topics of local relevance (e.g., preserving Native American artifacts, water conservation, the biology of native game fish, etc.). The programming will include learning from, and creating content for, demonstration installations to be incorporated into micro-museums. As part of the academy experience, students will be evaluated for both affect and spatial ability, and the results of the program will be assessed by an Education Advisory Board and disseminated to both local and out of state partners. Opportunities for program perpetuation and expansion will be provided through a collaboration with the UTAH Stem Action Center.<br/><br/>The long-term goal of this research is to create glasses-free, interactive, 3D environments as tools to expand human capacity and creativity. The PI's recent research has led to a novel, non-holographic method of screenless 3D display with the potential to change how we interact with our data by making it physically present. To this end, the objective of the current project is to create and evaluate parallel optical trap displays (OTDs) as tools for spatial thinking. Free-floating 3D displays have been the ""holy grail"" of 3D imaging for over a century. Such a display would be potentially transformative for many information visualization applications; however, the application space with perhaps the greatest potential scientific impact would be that of spatial thinking, a skill that has been foundational to many of the greatest scientific achievements in history and which is also strongly associated with both interest and achievement in STEM. The PI's prototype OTD is a natively spatial 3D technology ideally suited to spatial thinking that is currently capable of drawing full-color, video-rate images of small objects with a single trapped particle. Achieving larger image volumes will require a new ""parallel"" OTD approach that creates a large volume OTD from multiple trapped particles illuminated independently and simultaneously. The central hypothesis of this work is that parallel OTDs will lead to better mastery of spatial concepts (as measured by standard spatial thinking tests) by making data physical and interactive. To test this hypothesis, the PI will optimize single particle traps, develop at least two parallel display methods (e.g. point trap array and line trap array), and compare parallel OTDs against screen-based tools for spatial reasoning.  Parallel OTDs will be capable of providing all of the 3D visual cues of holography (accommodation, parallax, and potentially even occlusion) without being subject to its limitations (aperture constraints and prohibitive computational complexity).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

T-MARC-BIO will contribute to developing a diverse, globally engaged scientific workforce pipeline by recruiting highly qualified female, low-income, and minority students, who are underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>Through T-MARC-BIO, students will (1) participate in a semester-long pre-travel research preparation and cross-cultural program, (2) conduct rigorous individual research projects on tephritid fruit flies during a seven-week period in Australia, (3) immerse themselves in Australian culture as they participate in research fields with global interest and impact, and (4) communicate their research through scientific journals and presentations, and in the local community. The U.S. and Australia make significant research investments to both enhance control of existing pest fly populations and improve interdiction of invasive flies entering the respective countries. The results of T-MARC-BIO student-assisted research will advance knowledge in three areas: tephritid fruit fly physiology and behavior, organic analysis and synthesis of fruit fly lures, and field ecology and management techniques. Collectively, these results will address gaps in understanding of how fruit flies metabolize secondary plant compounds, what they smell and what attracts them, how they move in the environment, and how to develop more effective control techniques, such as attractant fruit fly lures. Evaluation findings about the T-MARC-BIO project will be applicable to small (two- and four-year) colleges, their administrators, and STEM faculty. T-MARC-BIO students will share the benefits of enriched, multidisciplinary academic research training and participating in publishable research that advances STEM fields, as well as basic and applied science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given the severity and urgency of this threat it is critical to investigate mechanisms by which some corals might survive warming, assess the degree to which this is happening on reefs, and apply these discoveries to inform conservation interventions that might improve survival trajectories wherever possible. This project aims to fulfill these objectives by testing whether reef corals in the Caribbean are undergoing shifts in their algal symbionts in favor of more heat-tolerant types, what the consequences of these shifts might be for coral reef ecosystems, and the way in which we might use this information to help conserve them. Scientific objectives will be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of reef restoration efforts in the Caribbean by applying findings to ongoing intervention trials which aim to seed outplanted corals (both adult fragments raised in nurseries, and sexually derived coral recruits) with heat tolerant algae that are climate-resistant. It also takes advantage of emerging opportunities at two major public aquariums to highlight the plight of coral reefs to engaged public audiences primed to receive this message and learn about the role of science in both understanding and mitigating the problem. Finally, numerous high school, undergraduate, and graduate students will receive mentorship during this project, helping to train the next generation of marine scientists. <br/><br/>This project tests whether continued climate warming is causing heat-tolerant algal symbionts (such as Durusdinium trenchii) to become increasingly common on coral reefs in the Caribbean. Understanding the changing symbiotic ""milieu"" in the region, the processes underlying the spread of D. trenchii, and the consequences of this spread, are very timely questions that have the potential to help us understand future reef states. This project will: (1) Manipulate coral symbioses in the laboratory, including a number of Caribbean coral species never before attempted, to assess in a standardized way their relative ability to acquire heat-tolerant symbionts; (2) Outplant corals with manipulated symbiont communities to reefs to assess real-world ecophysiological tradeoffs to heat tolerance, such as reduced growth rate; (3) Introduce heat-tolerant symbionts to coral colonies in the field using tissue implants in order to understand environmental controls on the persistence or loss of introduced symbionts; (4) Evaluate transgenerational feedbacks in the symbiotic milieu by investigating the roles of temperature and D. trenchii availability on the acquisition and establishment of these symbionts in newly settled coral larvae; and (5) Quantify changes in the incidence and relative abundance of heat-tolerant symbionts in the Caribbean over the last ~20 years using unique archived samples dating back to 1995-2002 from Florida, Bahamas, Belize, and Bermuda.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One driver of this low success rate is the insufficient preparation of community college students for the differences they will face at the four-year institution. In addition, the four-year institution often lacks social and academic support to help bridge this gap.  This project aims to increase the success of engineering and computer science students who transfer to Clemson University from Spartanburg Community College or Trident Community College, or from any of the 16 technical colleges in South Carolina. Over a five-year period, 316 students will receive scholarships of up to four years, to support their successful transfer and attainment of a bachelor's degrees in engineering or computing from Clemson University.  In addition to the scholarship support, the project includes evidence-based mentorship and cohort building activities that support transfer student success.  The project features an innovative Ph.D. student traineeship that links Clemson graduate students with community college faculty and students.  The graduate students will receive training in teaching, mentoring, and education research, and work closely with the scholarship students both at the community colleges, and after the students transfer to Clemson. It is expected that the project will contribute to the quality and diversity of the national STEM workforce and increase understanding of what works to support success of transfer students.<br/><br/>In addition to providing scholarships to low-income, academically high-achieving transfer students, this project addresses well-known hurdles for transfer students by implementing and assessing a cohort mentoring model based on evidence-based strategies including communities of practice and cognitive mentorship.  The program elements are designed to support transfer student enculturation in the university, as well as degree completion and placement in the industrial workforce.  The program will recruit and train ten Clemson STEM PhD students for careers in academia by engaging them in immersive experiences in teaching, mentoring, and applied educational research. This training will include a residency at the community college sites where they will: 1) co-teach engineering courses with community college faculty; 2) develop and lead a cohort of low-income community college students in a project-based Creative Inquiry course that will be a focus of applied educational research; and 3) return to Clemson with the developed cohort, thus helping to bridge the institutional gap.  The program will conduct rigorous internal and external educational assessment and program evaluation to identify key indicators of student success and to provide information that can be used to improve STEM education at other institutions. Results from this work will be broadly disseminated through digital outlets (e.g., e-newsletters; listservs), presentations at national conferences, and publications in peer-reviewed and trade journals to reach audiences ranging from higher education to low-income students with aspirations of excellence.  This project is funded by the NSF Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income, academically high-achieving students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future scientists, engineers, and technicians, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As dissolved magmatic species H2O and CO2 exsolve and produce a separate vapor phase, magma buoyancy and magma ascent rate increase. Bubble expansion driven by decompression accelerates vesiculation, further increasing magma ascent rate, and thereby the potential for increasing conduit overpressure. Thus, the processes governing volatile exsolution and outgassing, and particularly the timing of initial vapor phase nucleation with respect to depth in the conduit, control a magma's explosive potential. A key unresolved aspect of eruption of crystal-poor silicic magmas is whether bubble nucleation occurs homogeneously (in the bulk fluid) or heterogeneously (aided by a substrate). The distinction is important because homogeneous bubble nucleation requires substantively larger pressure overstepping, or supersaturation than heterogeneous bubble nucleation.  Magnetite crystals are known to enhance the rate of bubble nucleation by providing energetically-favorable substrates, and yet failure to detect a sufficiently high abundance of these crystals in natural pumice has supported the inference that bubble nucleation occurs homogenously. However when numerical ascent models are supplied with measured bubble number densities and executed specifying homogeneous bubble nucleation, the predicted decompression and ascent rates are not only inconsistent with independent assessments but also present physical paradoxes. This study explores the possibility that nanometer sized magnetite particles are present in magmas prior to eruption, and that these crystals trigger bubble nucleation at much lower supersaturation values (i.e., at greater depth in the plumbing system) than would occur in their absence. This proposal provides educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and highlights participation of under-represented minorities at the University of Hawaii and Montclair State University (NJ). Professional development for Natural Science educators will be provided through a series of workshops focusing on local geology, volcanology, and Earth processes operating over short and long time scales.<br/><br/>This project addresses the question: do bubbles nucleate homogeneously or heterogeneously in explosively erupting rhyolite magma? The objectives of the work to be undertaken are to ascertain whether plinian rhyolite pumices contain nano-scale titanomagnetite crystals in numerical abundances that rival those of bubbles and to quantify the potential influence of titanomagnetite crystals in bubble nucleation. Addressing these issues is critical for understanding eruptive processes at a fundamental level and is of practical significance in the numerical modeling of conduit flow dynamics and thus assessment of volcanic hazard. The work plan centers around two tasks: (a) applying techniques of rock magnetism to characterize the number density and size distribution of titanomagnetite crystals in nominally aphyric pumice clasts spanning a range in bubble interconnectivity; and (b) performing novel laboratory crystallization experiments utilizing fO2 modulation to isolate the influence of titanomagnetite from other variables. Magnetic characterization (resolving the magnetic domain states, particle number densities, and size distributions of submicron titanomagnetite crystals) is promising because it lowers the detection limit of sparse Fe-Ti oxides by several orders of magnitude relative to traditional electron microprobe imaging. Pairwise measurement of clast permeability, to be obtained for a suite of natural rhyolites spanning a range in eruption parameters and textural attributes, will facilitate determination of magnetite-bubble nucleation chronology. In an experimental task, magnetite stability will be manipulated using ambient fO2 in order to generate rhyolite magma containing populations of magnetite crystals that span large ranges in number density and volume fraction. A subsequent vesiculation step will evaluate the quantitative control of magnetite nanoparticle number density on the bubble-formation process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet no emissions-free solutions for process heat are commonly available today. Thermal energy requires burning fuel. Beyond the impact to local air quality and climate change, the need for fuel creates energy poverty both domestically and abroad. When fuel supplies are threatened, it can endanger the livelihoods of those that depend on the fuel.<br/>The impact of Skyven?s solution is to turn the sun into a viable, practical source of high temperature thermal energy. It has the potential to dramatically reduce CO2 emissions, improve local air quality, reduce energy poverty, and diversify America?s energy supply. Just a single Skyven project of 500 collectors will offset 29,900 gallons of diesel fuel, equivalent to planning 4,400 trees. Skyven envisions doing thousands of projects across the USA and tens of thousands across the globe. One day IMA technology may even enable rural areas and developing nations to leapfrog natural gas distribution infrastructure in the same way that cellphones have leapfrogged landlines. This project is an opportunity for the United States to take a leadership role in technology to enable these societal changes.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research Phase II project will address a key barrier to solar thermal deployment in the industrial sector: lack of an effective interface to connect high temperature solar thermal system with legacy fuel-fired thermal systems.  Existing interfaces are limited to low temperatures (below 100?C) and utilize costly plumbing schemes that are prone to failure. They suffer from poor reliability and create severe maintenance headaches, rendering them unusable in the industrial sector.  These systems also typically require the host facility to be take offline during installation ? an costly sacrifice in the industrial sector.  The temperature limitations are particularly problematic, as many industrial facilities operate high temperatures condensate return systems that rarely drop below 100?C.  <br/>Skyven?s system-level innovations solve these challenges, making its high temperature solar thermal collectors a practical and financially-attractive option for industries such as food processing.  Phase II research will implement two innovations in particular: (1) solar steam injection into a traditional fuel-fired boiler; and (2) wireless control with automated optical calibration/commissioning algorithms and failsafe stagnation/overheat protection. In addition, the project will prove out high temperature operation up to 200C, both in outdoor laboratory-scale testbed and later in a real-world industrial facility.  It will also utilize advanced reliability engineering concepts to show long-term (20 year) reliability without requiring unlimited test time and testing resources.  The project will also advance knowledge in the space of industrial controls engineering, showing that new industrial systems can be integrated with existing controls through innovative controls interfacing, without require rework of the existing control systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By 2018, this outbreak had caused dramatic death of trees across thousands of acres of oak forest. It has been more than thirty years since this invasive insect caused such extensive tree damage and death in eastern North America. This event has created a fleeting opportunity to address a fundamental question in ecology: what are the immediate causes of tree death? Hardwood trees draw on stored starches and sugars in the spring to produce new leaves. Gypsy moths eat leaves, limiting a tree's ability to store enough sugars and starches, and if these drop below a critical level, the tree can die. During last year's outbreak, the researchers established a network of plots in oak forests that had experienced differing severity and frequency of gypsy moth activity. If they act fast and sample starches and sugars from oak trees that have experienced defoliation for 0 to 3 years before they leaf-out this spring, then follow these trees through the next growing season, the researchers can determine if starvation directly causes tree death. Better understanding of the timing and causes of tree mortality will inform forest and landscape tree management. This research will also provide student training in answering science questions and how to apply scientific knowledge to solving forest management problems.<br/><br/>Temperate deciduous trees draw on stores of non-structural carbohydrates (NSC) in the spring to produce new xylem and foliage. The carbon starvation hypothesis posits that when NSC stores become depleted, secondary growth and flushing is impossible or inadequate, and the tree dies. Defoliation, such as occurs during gypsy moth infestations, is a straightforward mechanism for testing the carbon starvation hypothesis. This study will evaluate NSC levels in relationship to defoliation frequency and severity to determine if there is a critical NSC threshold below which tree mortality occurs. The researchers will sample NSCs by collecting small wood samples from the stem and root of oak trees with known defoliation histories. This study has the potential to offer a mechanistic understanding of tree mortality events and inform the models scientists and policy-makers rely on to forecast ecosystem responses to global change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Peripheral IV access (PIV) is the most common invasive procedure for all ages, races and clinical settings. In the United States alone, there are an estimated 230 million PIVs placed per year. First time IV access has a shockingly high failure rate of 35%-50%.  Multiple attempts result in pain and emotional distress, especially in the pediatric population where the failure rate is highest. The average cost of placing an IV on the first time is $69.76.  Three or more attempts doubles the cost to be greater than $125 per IV. When PIV access cannot be obtained the more invasive, risky and costly central IV access is used which increases the risk of blood borne infections as well as other complications. One central IV sourced infection can add 7-20 additional days of hospital length of stay and $56,000 of additional (unreimbursed) cost, adding as much as $2.3 billion in increased US intensive care unit costs each year.  These failure rates occur even though ultrasound and near infrared devices are available to improve first time IV access. <br/><br/>In phase II, the project team will refine the hybrid Optical Coherence Tomography tipped imaging probe, customized for vascular access, and integrate it into a commercially viable system to fulfill goals not supported by any other imaging system: finding and recognizing veins; guiding the angiocath needle to the vein; acquiring intra lumen access on first attempt; and confirming intra lumen placement.

This plant cell wall provides structural support, defines the size and shape of cells, and provides a barrier to infection by pathogens. Plant cell walls are diverse and highly dynamic structures that respond to developmental and environmental cues. The main load-bearing component of plant cell walls is cellulose, which is made at the surface of cells by a large enzyme complex called cellulose synthase. In this project, it will be characterized how plants regulate how much cellulose they make. Prior work uncovered a pathway that controls this process by modulating the movement of the cellulose synthase complex to the cell surface. How this pathway works and how it interacts with the other elements in the cell to control cellulose synthase will be explored. Further, a novel signaling molecule, 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC), a precursor to ethylene, was found to act in this pathway. How ACC is perceived by cells and how it acts to modulate cellulose synthase function will be determined. The results from this work will provide insight into how plants regulate cell wall biosynthesis, which is crucial to understanding the development of plant form and other processes and is important for the burgeoning biofuels industry. This project will interact with programs designed to increase the representation of minorities in the sciences and several outreach programs that aim to increase the public understanding of plant science.<br/><br/>A signaling pathway regulating cell wall synthesis has been defined that includes the FEI receptor-like kinases, SHOU4 (a novel transmembrane protein), and ACC acting as a signal independent of its conversion to ethylene. Prior results suggest that this pathway regulates CESA (cellulose synthase) function by modulating CESA trafficking to the plasma membrane. A diverse set of complementary experiments are proposed to further elucidate how this pathway regulates CESA function. A primary hypothesis that will be tested is that SHOU4 acts as a counter of CESA levels at the PM, with the complex generating a signal to negatively regulate CESA exocytosis to maintain optimal levels of cellulose biosynthesis. One key aspect of this model is the direct interaction of SHOU4 and CESA. This interaction will be further characterized, including elucidating the role of phosphorylation, potentially by the FEI kinases. Outputs of this complex will be identified by screening for proteins that interact with SHOU4. A second hypothesis that will be tested is that ACC negatively regulates CESA function. A genetic screen was used to identify elements involved in ACC perception. These mutant lines will be further characterized and the genes corresponding to these mutations will be cloned and characterized. These studies will increase the understanding of how cell wall biosynthesis is regulated, a process that is central to many aspects of plant growth and development and which is important for the burgeoning biofuels industry.

As key lightweight enablers, successful utilizations of advanced lightweight materials and multi-material structures rely on economical and reliable joining processes. Resistance spot welding (RSW), as one of the most extensively used technologies in the automotive industry, is not suitable for joining dissimilar materials due to their different physical properties and metallurgical differences. In addition, RSW faces challenges in joining the newest generation of advanced high strength steel and aluminum alloys. In comparison, ultrasonic spot welding (USW) shows several advantages, but its applications are limited by the output power of generally available ultrasonic transducers. This award focuses on an innovative hybrid ultrasonic resistance welding (URW) process, which effectively integrates ultrasonic and resistance welding, maximizing the advantages of each process. Preliminary results show promising enhancements of joint mechanical performance with URW. The research will deeply advance the scientific understanding of the complex coupling mechanisms between electrical and acoustic fields. Since this technology has wide applicability to the automotive, aerospace and defense industries, the project directly impacts the economic welfare and national security of the United States. The successfully-developed URW process will significantly benefit manufacturing and assembly of lightweight, and especially multi-material structures. The inherent similarities of ultrasonic and RSW system make it naturally convenient to adapt existing RSW robots and equipment, facilitating widespread industrial applications of URW. The obtained knowledge on ultrasonically induced physical phenomena will deeply contribute to developing and improving various advanced manufacturing processes. One specific example is ultrasonic resistance additive manufacturing. The URW process and microstructural evolution model enhances applications of integrated computational materials engineering (ICME) in the field of solid-state manufacturing. Finally, the multidisciplinary educational program as a result of the award will empower next-generation engineers and researchers in the fields of mechanical, material, metallurgy, control, and data processing. <br/><br/>The objectives of this research are to advance the knowledge of multiphysical thermo-mechanical-electrical-acoustic coupling mechanisms involved with the novel hybrid URW process, to reveal the fundamental physics of weld structure evolution and to optimize URW for joining advanced lightweight and dissimilar materials. Ultrasonic vibration is hypothesized to affect RSW in three stages: modifying contact resistance through removal of surface coatings and contaminations, influencing thermodynamic and kinetic conditions during melting through acoustic streaming and cavitation effects, and refining microstructure during solidification. The scope of this research includes: (1) A comprehensive experimental study of URW at various conditions, followed by mechanical testing and multi-scale characterizations of the welds. Process-structure-properties relationships will be established; (2) In situ analysis of the URW process through high speed and thermal imaging, as well as multiphysical modeling to determine the thermo-mechanical field during the process. Al-Fe interfacial reaction model will also be developed, which will be verified through physical simulations of the inter-metallic compounds (IMC) formation and growth under a controlled thermo-mechanical testing environment. (3) Optimization of the URW process in terms of process parameters, electrode geometry along with the synchronization between acoustic and electrical fields for desirable joint performance with the minimum amount of input process energy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Date: April 4-5, 2019. The goal of ECOM is to introduce students and early-career researchers to current trends in optimization as well as to provide a strong networking environment between academia, industry, and the national laboratories. The focus of first meeting is Stochastic Optimization. Stochastic optimization problems arise in virtually all science and engineering fields. Common examples of stochastic optimization problems are: (i) determining an allocation of financial assets that minimize the potential for loss subject to market variability; (ii) controlling injection wells in second-stage oil recovery to maximize the net present value of a reservoir in which the subsurface rock properties are unknown; and (iii) designing a photonic meta-material to maximize light absorption subject to uncertain operating environments. For each of these problems, a decision maker must choose an allocation/control/design prior to observing the uncertain outcome (i.e., decisions are deterministic).  As a result, one must properly quantify the risks associated with each decision in order to control the outcome variability.  This need has led to the modern theory of stochastic and in particular risk-averse optimization. The meeting will provide a unique opportunity for graduate students, postdocs and other early career scientists to take courses from two of the best researchers in stochastic optimization and thus help train next generation of scientists. In addition, there will be four invited talks from the experts in the field and the students and postdocs will have an opportunity to share their work via contributed presentations. The knowledge gained during the meeting will be of relevance to fields such as finance, physics, biology, data science, machine (deep learning), and engineering. The meeting has an affiliation from Association of Women in Mathematics (AWM).<br/> <br/>Accurately representing the uncertainty when solving stochastic optimization problems often requires an enormous number of samples, which traditionally resulted in intractable nonlinear optimization problem.  However, owing to the recent advances in high-performance computing, computational simulation and numerical optimization, the numerical solution of such problems has become computationally feasible.  Additionally, this past year, four stochastic optimization researchers received prestigious awards including two Dantzig Award winners (one of our keynote speaker was among the two), a Khachiyan Prize winner and a Farkas Prize winner.  For these reasons, the topic of stochastic optimization is very timely for the inaugural East Coast Optimization Meeting. The proposed meeting has the potential to advance knowledge and understanding in modeling, optimization, numerical analysis, implementation and software development. Stochastic optimization encompasses numerous aspects from statistics, probability theory, optimization and variational analysis, convex analysis, and applied mathematics.  The meeting will stimulate new developments in these important areas of mathematics. The tutorials and invited talks will focus on real life problems and will discuss new optimization solvers to handle these problems. Thus the attendees can tackle new set of challenging problems. The variety of topics discussed in the meeting, stochastic optimization, modeling, partial differential equations, risk averse optimization is of much wider interest. For instance, these are relevant in finance, physics, biology, data science, and engineering. Participation from all these fields is expected. The ideas created in the meeting will be actively disseminated. We will upload the lecture notes on the conference website. These resources will help create new graduate courses.

Students belonging to groups underrepresented in mathematics are especially encouraged to apply.  This program will serve 6 early undergraduates each year and be run on the same campus as MathILy (serious Mathematics Infused with Levity), a 5-week very selective program of inquiry-based educational experiences for highly talented high-school students. MathILy-EST (MathILy Early Scholarly Training, pronounced ""mathily-est"") focuses on students who do not have other research opportunities, and will (a) train students in the mathematical thinking needed to conduct research, (b) increase participant persistence in the educational pipeline, (c) provide mentoring for students and early faculty research supervisors, and (d) provide cross-pollination with MathILy by proximity and by holding regular joint activities.  This REU Site program will give MathILy-EST participants early experience in active acquisition and creation of mathematical knowledge, which will in turn enable them to succeed in traditional mathematics classes. Training in software use, CV construction, presentation skills, and writing will give participants the informal knowledge and career skills needed to be competitive in the STEM workforce. Cross-fertilization between MathILy-EST participants and MathILy students and instructors will be significant: High-school participants in MathILy will see REU participants as mathematical role models and short-term future selves. They will see the processes of research happening around them and gain perspective on the mathematical enterprise. MathILy students and MathILy-EST participants alike will expand their networks beyond usual class cohorts to students of different ages.  The creation of peer networks along with mentoring of participants will increase their persistence in acquiring further mathematical education and research experience.  The existence of the MathILy-EST REU will prompt faculty discussion with first-year college students of summer opportunities that use their technical expertise, and thereby catalyze more fruitful advising for first-year college students within their home departments.<br/><br/>MathILy-EST participants will produce, present, and publish original research.  The program targets exceptional first-year college students, with second-year and entering college students also considered for participation.  The mathematical focus of MathILy-EST will change each year. The projects will be drawn from the following topics according to mentor availability: combinatorics of paperfolding, word length in the integers (additive number theory), free boundary problems (discrete PDEs), continuous-time game theory, and combinatorial representation theory.  MathILy-EST REU students will present their research progress to each other on a regular basis, with feedback provided on their research methods and presentation skills. Students will be asked to record work in writing (in LaTeX) weekly, to provide practice in writing formally and fodder for paper drafts once research has progressed to the point of publication.  At the end of the MathILy-EST REU program, the director will make plans with students, including sub-goals and timelines, for dissemination of their research results. This will include discussing potential local (MAA) and national (JMM) conference presentations and paper submissions.

The research improves our fundamental understanding of lipid membranes by synthesizing them from readily available starting materials and then measuring their physical properties. Lipid membranes are universal features of living systems, constituting protective inner and outer barriers of cells. Nature has produced a fascinating array of lipid structures that dictate the function of biological membranes, and organisms devote considerable energy to the synthesis and maintenance of such compositions. Professor Burns is investigating new synthetic reactions to make lipids that are not readily available from natural sources. This research increases our understanding how lipids are formed and how they can be utilized biological and non-biological systems. This research is multidisciplinary and extends beyond the typical boundaries of synthetic chemistry or biology. Through a strong established collaboration, synthetic chemists are working with physical chemists to study the properties of the synthesized lipids, thus tackling larger scientific questions regarding the function of molecules. In order to impact the broader community, Professor Burns and his research group are making use of social media. Platforms such as Twitter and Instagram offer unique opportunities for cross-talk. Twitter (@burnschemistry) is used to communicate findings from the Professor Burns' lab in order to alert the chemical community to exciting new advances. Instagram (@burnschemistry) is used to promote the fun, exciting, and human side of organic chemistry research. The use of social media is intended to excite more young people to consider advanced degrees or careers in chemistry.<br/><br/>Professor Burns is developing selective and efficient syntheses of three classes of noncanonical membrane lipids in order to fully investigate their biophysical properties. Highly unusual polycyclobutane-containing ladderane phospholipids, monocyclohexane- and polycyclopentane-containing tetraether lipids, and polychlorinated sulfolipids have been identified from anaerobic ammonium-oxidizing bacteria, archaea, and freshwater algae, respectively. This research is establishing approaches for accessing each of these three classes of noncanonical membrane lipids. This chemical synthesis is impacting the broader synthetic community by providing new reaction methodologies and new strategies for accessing functional group motifs that are of interest in other contexts. The biophysical properties of natural and non-natural lipids are analyzed utilizing modern techniques to verify self-assembled structures, to measure monolayer density and compressibility, to evaluate permeability of ions and small molecules, and to interrogate membrane thickness and structure. This information has general implications for manipulating membrane properties and designing new soft materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They must also be able to think creatively, to collaborate across disciplines, and to work with people with different perspectives, knowledge, and values. There is compelling evidence that creativity training can stimulate both scientific creativity and interdisciplinary collaboration, but to date, little attention has been given to creativity training in STEM graduate education. This National Science Foundation Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) award to the University of Georgia will bring a diverse group of graduate students together from STEM and arts disciplines to address issues in the local watershed using creativity-based training methods from the arts. This project will investigate the impact of targeted creativity training on the ability of STEM students to frame problems in new ways and help diverse teams solve complex problems. If successful, widespread adoption of these methods will contribute to equipping STEM graduates across the country with communication and collaboration skills and ultimately increase creative and innovative solutions to complex global environmental challenges.<br/><br/>Over each of five semesters, this project will recruit a cohort of ten students in the early stages of graduate study, five from STEM disciplines who self-identify as interested in environmental science, and five from arts disciplines. Cohorts will meet for six workshops facilitated by two faculty members from STEM and arts disciplines. Workshops are designed to build core creative competencies and develop skills for collaborative interdisciplinary practice. Students will gain practical experience sharing disciplinary viewpoints, creating analogies from scientific concepts, and developing collaborative frameworks for complex problem solving. The final workshop will result in a set of proposed solutions to a local watershed problem, collaboratively identified by students and stakeholders. Complementary quantitative and qualitative methods will be used to examine students' abilities to shift thinking (increase ""cognitive flexibility""), generate novel ideas, and effectively communicate and collaborate with one another. This project seeks to fundamentally enhance how STEM students are educated by engaging them in creative processes related to their research topics. Successful elements will be incorporated into a scalable training model that will be widely disseminated and available for adoption at other institutions.<br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the widespread use of the internet, programmers' information seeking is shifting more and more towards web resources, especially when knowledgeable colleagues or good internal documentation are not available. Information found in online resources has become indispensable for programmers, and online programming video tutorials are an important resource frequently consulted by both novice and experienced programmers. Therefore, it is of paramount importance to ensure that programmers can search, access, acquire, understand, and use this information efficiently and to develop tools and techniques that facilitate these actions. To achieve this one must first find answers to a few important questions. How do programmers use video tutorials to support their tasks? What information do they find useful? What tasks are improved? How one can better support programmers' information needs through leveraging video tutorials? The goal of this project is to address existing gaps and improve the body of knowledge about the topic coverage, usage, and quality of crowd-based programming video tutorials. The project will develop techniques to improve the way video tutorials are used and created by programmers. The outcomes of this project will transform the way programmers and computer science students acquire knowledge from video tutorials. The goal is to support better learning and instruction in software engineering settings and in the classroom. This can lead to time and effort savings that in turn can result in decreased software costs. The project will also organize a Scratch summer coding camp for middle schoolers which aims to broaden participation in the field of Computer Science. <br/><br/>The project will focus in scope on publicly available video tutorials related to popular programming languages. The goals will be achieved through the application of novel techniques and tools that facilitate the extraction of correct source code, audio transcripts, and the topic coverage of programming video tutorials. A taxonomy will be developed to characterize the properties of quality programming video tutorials. Evaluation will be done using interviews, user studies, and surveys. A novel model of the quality of crowd-based programming video tutorials will be synthesized from user data and data automatically mined from video tutorials.

Thus, it is imperative that as these antibiotic-resistant bacteria evolve, so must the medicines that are utilized to treat them. In this research project, Professor Shaowei Chen from the University of California Santa Cruz proposes to use composite materials based on graphene oxide and metal/metal oxide nanoparticles as next-generation, low-cost, potent antimicrobial reagents. This is to take advantage of their synergistic interactions in the bactericidal actions, where the antimicrobial activity of the composites is markedly enhanced as compared to those of the individual components. The success of the proposed research will help establish a unique platform for the development of high-performance antimicrobial reagents. Additionally, the proposed research will offer an educational framework within which student researchers will acquire many complex skills by undertaking an interdisciplinary effort. Also, part of the research activities will be closely integrated with several outreach programs targeting minority, women, and disadvantaged undergraduate students and qualified high-school students. The students will acquire skills that are unattainable in a conventional classroom setting. The hands-on experience and intense training in laboratory research are anticipated to instill a strong sense of self-confidence and good work ethics in their future careers as part of the STEM workforce.<br/><br/><br/>The central goal of the proposed research is to advance our understanding of the mechanistic origin of graphene-based nanocomposites in antimicrobial applications and to develop a fundamental framework for the rational design and engineering of nanocomposites based on metal (oxide) nanoparticles and graphene derivatives as low-cost, high-efficiency antimicrobial reagents. There are three specific tasks: (a) design and engineering of graphene nanosheets, where the graphene structures (e.g., size, morphology, surface functionalization) will be systematically manipulated and the impacts on the antimicrobial activity will be carefully examined, (b) preparation of functional nanocomposites based on metal (oxide) nanoparticles deposited on graphene nanosheets, where the nanocomposite photo reactivity will be exploited as a powerful variable in the further manipulation and optimization of the antimicrobial activity, and (c) establishment of a structure-activity correlation by combining (nano)materials and molecular biology approaches, with a focus on unravelling the fundamental mechanisms in the bactericidal process. The proposed research is built upon recent progress in Professor Chen's laboratory where apparent antimicrobial activity was observed with transition-metal nanoparticles as well as graphene quantum dots, with the production of reactive oxygen species identified as the leading mechanism of action. A wide range of experimental tools will be employed in the research activities. For materials characterizations, these include transmission electron microscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, X-ray diffraction, nuclear magnetic resonance, electron paramagnetic resonance, UV-visible, Raman, infrared, and photoluminescence spectroscopy. Using Escherichia coli as the illustrating example, the antimicrobial activity towards the inhibition of bacterial growth will be quantitatively assessed by UV-visible spectroscopic and fluorescence microscopic measurements, and the biochemical origins will be examined by RNA sequencing, within the context of reactive oxygen species generation and bacteria cell membrane damages. A direct, intimate correlation between these two efforts is anticipated to shed light on the mechanisms of action and lead to the establishment of a fundamental framework within which rational design and engineering of graphene-based nanocomposites can be achieved for optimal antimicrobial performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are the location of many societally-relevant hazards, including the generation of Earth's deadliest earthquakes, such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and associated tsunami, and volcanic eruptions such as those at Mt St Helens (1980) and Mt Pinatubo (1991). The processes that lead to these earthquakes and volcanoes are ultimately dependent on the thermal structure of subduction zones - that is how hot it is at great depths. Metamorphic rocks exhumed from ancient subduction zones contain unique records of the temperatures that they witnessed as they traveled down a subduction zone before being exhumed. Geodynamic models and geophysical observations provide estimates of the thermal structures of present-day subduction zones. Interestingly, the rock record suggests significantly warmer conditions than those predicted for modern subduction zones. The proposed work will investigate the reasons for this discrepancy, which may lie in the way we interpret conditions from the rocks, the way they are exhumed, or even in how we compare model predictions and the rock record.<br/><br/>This proposal aims to address the rock-model discrepancy through two key questions: 1) Does our current interpretation of the rock record accurately represent the thermal structure of the associated ancient subduction zone? and 2) Did rocks get exhumed from ancient subduction zones that were hotter on average than modern subduction zones? To address Question 1 this team will determine P-T conditions for metamorphic rocks exhumed from five well-characterized localities that represent a range of thermal structures using relatively new analytical methods: trace element thermometers (e.g. Zr-in-rutile) and mineral inclusion barometers (e.g. quartz-in-garnet barometry). To address Question 2, they will develop geodynamical models of the ancient subduction zones represented by the exhumed rocks. These models will incorporate the effects of region-specific subduction dynamics, such as variations in slab age and subduction rate with time, subduction initiation, ridge subduction, and slab breakoff, when applicable. The model-predicted P-T conditions along the subduction interface will be compared with the newly produced P-T estimates to re-evaluate their disparity. The two-pronged approach of combining petrological observations and geodynamical modeling allows quantitative exploration of the thermal evolution of subduction zones. Subduction-related metamorphic rocks are the only direct samples of material from the plate interface; evaluating the P-T conditions using the latest thermobarometric approaches will provide the team with a more accurate and precise way to untangle the complex history they have experienced. Through geodynamical modeling, the effects of individual parameters on the thermal structure of subduction zones can be isolated, and this targeted approach will allow evaluation of possible explanations for the warm conditions that are recorded by exhumed rocks. The application of the two-pronged approach to the selected ancient subduction localities will allow researchers to determine whether the disparity can be reconciled. The results of this work have important implications for many processes, including geochemical cycling of volatiles, construction of continental crust, and the conditions that lead to arc volcanism. This work will engage graduate students and early career scientists in new collaborations between scientists of different disciplines (petrologists and geodynamicists) and at different institutions both in the US and abroad. EarthCache (TM) sites will be created in California (Franciscan and Catalina) as part of the project. These sites will engage the public in geoscience through the popular activity of geocaching and will disseminate information about subduction zone geology through information tied to direct observations of geologic features exhumed from subduction zones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Even given the same climate forcings, LSMs predict different surface fluxes and soil moisture conditions. This is due to differences in the formulations of individual processes, parameterizations of those formulations, numerical solution methods and representation of spatial heterogeneity. All of these differences contribute to LSM prediction errors and uncertainty.  Increasing confidence in climate predictions requires revisiting fundamental process understanding and using that understanding to improve representations of land-atmosphere feedbacks. This research seeks to address this challenge by answering questions on multiphase fluid transport mechanisms in surface soils and mass/energy exchange at the soil-atmosphere interface. New knowledge and modeling approaches will result in improved predictions for water supply and food security as well as environmental issues across the nation. Linked to the research plan is an educational framework for engaging minority middle school students in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM).  Focusing on the integrating theme of water and climate, the investigator will help students make the link between STEM they learn in the classroom and environmental water resource problems in their own backyards, motivating and preparing students to pursue college studies and ultimately careers in STEM fields. The integrated activities will help to build a scientifically literate and informed citizenry, while also answering critical water and climate questions. This project will contribute substantially to the goals of the NSF in the production of interdisciplinary knowledge and the education of middle-school students, young scientists and engineers. <br/><br/>	The overarching goal of this research is to advance our understanding and modeling of mass and energy exchange at the land-atmosphere interface over a wide range of scales, and ultimately improve LSMs that are utilized in global climate prediction. The proposed research will systematically explore how the shallow subsurface and the atmosphere, specifically the layer very close to the soil surface, interact, providing new insights into mass and thermal flux process interactions that will be integrated into LSMs. A focus on scaling based on process understanding at multiple scales will allow for process-rich parameterizations for multiple land-atmosphere interaction and subsurface processes that contribute to LSMs. This vision includes unique highly controlled mechanistic studies in the laboratory, leveraging of existing laboratory and field data, modeling of critical mass and energy dynamics, and the characterization of important interactions from the laboratory to the watershed scales that drive feedbacks to climate systems. Project results will yield unique, high-fidelity data that will greatly aid in improving our understanding and modeling of the processes affected by heterogeneity at various scales and the development of methods to mechanistically represent the proposed processes at the watershed scale. A suite of climate intermediate, and fine scale computational models will be used to guide observations and interpret data; process studies will provide new algorithms and process parameterizations and evaluate model performance. Computational models in conjunction with experimental data will enable the investigator to understand governing flow and transport mechanisms under different atmospheric forcing at different scales.  This research is expected to improve the representation of mass and energy exchange processes across multiple scales at the soil-land-atmosphere interface."

This process is associated with a large array of geological hazards such as magnitude 9 megathrust earthquakes and explosive arc volcanism. Today, millions of people live in areas that are potentially exposed to subduction zone hazards, including large regions of Cascadia and Alaska. However, the mechanisms by which water-rich rocks are transferred from the down-going plate (slab) into the Earth's interior, and the consequences of this transfer process on geological hazards, remain largely unknown. The best rock samples to study material transfer in subduction zones are unique rocks called melanges ('mixed' rocks) that come from the top of the slab. Although largely overlooked in most subduction zone models, these rocks may play a significant role in the generation of arc lavas, and strongly influence the geodynamics of subduction zones. This project will combine high-pressure, high-temperature laboratory experiments on melange materials with numerical modeling to quantify this transfer process in the Earth's interior. This transformative and interdisciplinary approach will provide novel constraints on the role of melanges in the development of subduction zone hazards, as well as training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students.<br/><br/>Conventional models of subduction zones predict that trace element fractionations observed in arc magmas occur during two distinct events: (a) dehydration and release of fluids from altered oceanic crust, and (b) partial melting of sediments at the slab-mantle interface. However, no previous experimental studies have reproduced the chemistry of arc magmas by simulating this conventional model. By contrast, other studies argue that fluids, sediments, and serpentinized wedge mix together at the slab-mantle interface to form melanges, which are hybrid rocks composed of blocks of altered oceanic crust and sediments, mixed with serpentinized peridotite. As the slab descends, melanges formed at the top of the slab may partially melt and produce trace element fractionation typical of arc magmas directly at the slab-mantle interface. Alternatively, melanges may rise from the slab-mantle interface as solid diapirs and partially melt during their ascent, delaying the onset of trace element fractionation. In both scenarios, melange melts would react with the peridotite mantle wedge on their way to the surface, combining their chemical characteristics with that of the mantle. This project will combine a series of high-pressure, high-temperature experiments with numerical modeling to investigate the chemical and physical behavior of natural melange rocks in subduction zones. The combined experimental and modeling results will provide a transformative approach to assess the role of melanges in subduction zone magmatism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In high yield agricultural soils N2OR is often inadequately active. Thus, N2O has been continuously increasing in post-industrial atmosphere, so that it accounts for about 12% of present radiative forcing by greenhouse gases. N2O is also a significant ozone depleting chemical. A novel and potentially transformative solution to agricultural emissions of N2O will be investigated in this project. <br/><br/>N2OR will be expressed in plant mitochondria so that it is active continuously, removing N2O from soil and atmosphere. N2OR has been reported to be active under anoxic conditions in vitro in extracts of plants conventionally transformed with nosZ, the structural gene for N2OR. Using the expertise that the investigators have developed in their lab for the construction of novel synthetic genetic vectors for phytoremediation, they will express nosZ modified with the amino acid sequences that target the proteins to the mitochondria matrix and inner periplasmic membrane of the mitochondria. The mitochondrion is the site of respiratory reduction in the cell, i.e., the site of oxygen consumption, and is analogous to the site of N2O reduction in denitrifying bacteria. This is a high-risk project, but with great potential benefits of global importance. With one year of funding, the project seeks to determine:<br/>1. whether N2O reduction in whole plants is possible using current nosZ sequences and mitochondrial targeting sequences,<br/>2. whether the putative helper genes in the nos operon, nosXDFYL, are necessary for optimal N2OR expression, and<br/>3. whether N2OR expressing plants can prevent N2O emissions from fertilized soils.<br/>If N2OR can be made to be active in plants and if this technology is applied on a large scale to crops such as maize and rice, it is expected that N2O emissions from grain cultivation could be cut significantly, resulting in a sudden reduction in N2O increases. Potentially this reduction could be accomplished sustainably with little to no additional energy expenditure. This would be a major and welcome cut in greenhouse gas and ozone depleting emissions, unanticipated by present IPCC projections.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The annual IUI conferences represent the growing interest in next-generation intelligent interactive user interfaces.  Attracting 200-300 attendees, they are the premier forum where researchers from academia and industry worldwide who work at the intersection of Human-Computer Interaction (HCI) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) come together to exchange insights and to present outstanding research and applications whose goal is to make the computerized world a more amenable place.  Unlike traditional AI the focus is not so much on making the computer smart all by itself, but rather on making the interaction between computers and people smarter; and unlike traditional HCI, there is a focus on solutions that involve large amounts of knowledge and emerging technologies such as natural language understanding, brain-computer interfaces, and gesture recognition.  To this end, IUI encourages contributions not only from computer science but also from related fields such as psychology, behavioral science, cognitive science, computer graphics, design, the arts, etc.  This funding will enable attendance at the IUI conference by students who might otherwise be unable to do so for financial reasons.  It will enhance the educational experience of funded participants, by bringing them into contact with leading researchers in the field and by exposing them to the lively discussion during the course of the conference that often leads to opportunities for professional development.  The quality of the conference itself will be enhanced as well, thanks to a broadening of the base of institutions represented and increased diversity of participants.  The rich exchange of ideas at IUI has previously proven to be a valuable source of ideas for future research, as well as leading to collaborative efforts; this funding will extend the opportunities for collaboration and provide intellectual stimulus to programs that have previously sent few or no representatives to this conference.  The organizing committee has undertaken to proactively recruit student participants from schools that have not traditionally been well represented in the IUI community.  Women and students who are members of underrepresented groups will be particularly encouraged to participate. <br/><br/>The IUI 2019 Student Consortium will build on the success of previous such events.  The heart of the Consortium will be a full-day workshop on March 20.  Student trainees will be afforded exposure to their new research community by giving a 20-30 presentation on their work and receiving feedback from peers and a panel of senior researchers.  The event will include opportunities for students to engage in discussion with peers and mentors, which will enhance community building. The students' work will also be featured during the main conference in a poster session, where they will gain additional experience explaining their work to others in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

""Megaripples"" are common features on marine sediments where bottom currents are rapid. In the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, these sand dune-like features are up to half a meter in height, with wavelengths reaching 20 meters. The investigators propose that megaripples act as large filter systems that rapidly convert dissolved and solid organic matter into inorganic carbon and nutrients, and thus influence the biological productivity of coastal waters. They propose to use a one-kilometer long megaripple field in the inlet of Chotawhatchee Bay, in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, as a natural laboratory for studying these processes. In addition, they will conduct laboratory experiments to investigate the filter processes at a smaller scale. By producing data on the functioning of megaripples, the project addresses a knowledge gap that has implications on our understanding of the cycles of matter in coastal waters. The project offers opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students in learning state-of-the-art techniques. The students will gain experience in working on high frequency data acquisition and analysis of 'big data'. To enhance outreach, the researchers will develop and teach two courses on Permeable Sediment Biogeochemistry and Aquatic Eddy Covariance Studies for the Saturday at the Sea program offered by Florida State University. Results will be disseminated via scientific journals, conference presentations and public lectures, and directly to the Apalachicola-National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR), which will make the results available to the other 28 NERR sites. <br/><br/>The two main project objectives are: 1) demonstrate the general function of megaripples as biocatalytical filters, and 2) demonstrate that common inlet megaripples contribute to nutrient retention in coastal bays.  A 1 km long megaripple field in the inlet of Chotawhatchee Bay (wavelengths: ~20 m, amplitudes: 20 to 40 cm) in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico will be used as an in-situ laboratory. Measurements will characterize megaripple topography and the water flowing over them. Salinity and suspended particles are utilized as natural tracers to quantify solute and particle entrainment into the megaripples. This project will deploy non-invasive aquatic eddy covariance instruments equipped with newly developed robust sensors to quantify sedimentary remineralization in the flushed megaripple bed. This technique integrates the benthic oxygen flux over a large section of the megaripple field, while including the natural dynamics of currents and light. Real-time water column measurements with a boat-mounted flow-through analyzer permit rapid quantification of large horizontal gradients of key water column parameters. The in-situ measurements will be combined with laboratory column reactor experiments that quantify nutrient re-mobilization through organic carbon mineralization in flushed megaripple sand. The megaripple field in the inlet of Chotawhatchee Bay is easily accessible from shore and by small boat, expediting instrument deployments and in-situ measurements while reducing project costs. Synthesis of all data will produce a conceptual and quantitative understanding of megaripples as natural biocatalytical filters. Because transport and reaction in megaripples are governed by basic physical and biogeochemical processes, these results will reveal information on the general biogeochemical functioning of megaripples that so far is not available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Though increased mantle temperatures could slow seismic wave speeds, constraints from erupted lava compositions indicate that the mantle in this region is warm, but not hot enough to account for the observed maximum slowness of seismic waves. Elevated concentrations of volatile elements (e.g., water, carbon) in the mantle can also slow seismic wave speeds, but these are unconstrained for the mantle along the East African Rift. Quantifying the abundance of water and carbon in the mantle in this region is critical to describing the magmatism that has occurred along the length of the rift, and its relationship to the process of rifting itself. Additionally, reconciling geophysical and geochemical models for the mantle in this region is a key test of the current understanding of Earth's mantle more broadly. This work will inform future field and experimental campaigns by presenting a synthesis of information that can be gleaned by existing sample sets and geophysical data sets. In addition to the scientific impacts, this work broadens the participation of underrepresented groups and supports several undergraduate and graduate students. This work will also inform an exhibit for the University of California-Riverside (UCR) Earth Sciences Museum.<br/><br/>If the mantle is significantly water- or carbon-rich, this could lead to mantle melting at higher pressures and lower temperatures than for a dry and carbon-free mantle. The presence of melts may also slow seismic wave speeds. This work will constrain the mantle source volatile composition at individual volcanic edifices and assess the importance of elevated volatiles, temperatures, and melts on the extreme nature of the geophysical anomaly under the rift, and to the initiation and evolution of the rift itself.

Megadroughts have the potential to critically affect society through disruptions involving agricultural production, food security, municipal water supplies, and ecosystem services. <br/><br/>The possibility that they may occur in the future is suggested by two lines of evidence: (1) they have occurred in North America during the past 2,000 years and several megadroughts even clustered together in time during the early Middle Ages; and (2) climate model simulations suggest that increasing global temperatures will progressively increase the likelihood of a megadrought in this century.  <br/><br/>Despite the awareness of megadrought recurrence, the causes of these droughts are inadequately understood because of a lack of long-term information about climate dynamics that is physically consistent with reconstructions of past megadroughts.

The potential dynamic causes and forcing of megadrought clustering during the early Medieval period will also be evaluated. The megadrought dynamical characterizations will subsequently be used to benchmark climate and to estimate the potential risk of megadroughts in the 21st century.<br/><br/>The potential Broader Impacts include greater understanding of megadroughts and their potential societal impact, support of an early career scientist, and involvement of undergraduates in the research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although different tissues and cells have distinct thresholds and susceptibility to hypoxia, at a cellular level, hypoxia and hypoxic responses generally occur at approximately 1-3 % oxygen.  Compelling evidence has shown that reduced tissue oxygenation is present in various diseases, and more particularly cancer.  A large number of human solid tumors profoundly lack oxygen, exhibiting hypoxic tumor areas; this condition is mainly due to an imbalance between delivery of oxygen via the blood circulation and consumption by cancer cells.  Hypoxia can arise via a number of mechanisms.  For instance, fast growing hypoxic tumors typically have poor vessel bio-distribution, increased vascular defects, and low vessel number.  Furthermore, highly proliferating cancer cells that outgrow the neovascularization also participate in tumor hypoxia.  An increasing list of cancers with hypoxic regions has been reported over the last decade and include endometrial carcinoma, ovarian, melanoma, lymphoma, breast, bladder, brain, head and neck, renal, colon, gastric, pancreatic, prostate, and non-small cell lung cancers.  The research objective of this proposal is to apply standard methods of biomaterials science and engineering to emulate a hypoxic tumor microenvironment and better understand the interplay between tumor and dendritic cells, the major directors of immune responses.  The proposed studies are likely to offer new modalities in cancer immunotherapy and are expected to justify the use of hypoxia-suppressive biomaterials, reinforce tumoricidal functions of immune cells, and ultimately increase tumor rejections.  The educational goal of this proposal is to introduce biomaterials science and engineering to high school students (develop hands-on science curriculum, promote practical research experience, and foster STEM field trips to the campus), enhance undergraduate research exposure and experience to underrepresented students (Hispanic, African-American, and female), and expand the Northeastern University co-op model to include graduate and academic lab experiences.  <br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/>Hypoxic cancers are usually aggressive, resistant to standard therapies, and thus very difficult to eradicate. A better understanding of how these hypoxic cancer cells interact with the immune system would allow tailoring of efficient therapies and better outcomes. Hypoxia can inhibit differentiation, antigen capture, maturation, lymph node homing of dendritic cells (DCs), the main regulators of immune responses, which can impair downstream T cell development, differentiation and cytotoxic activity.  Immunosuppression represents one of the fundamental tumor immune evasion mechanisms.  Therefore, it is important to expand our understanding on how hypoxia affects DCs and find ways to circumvent hypoxia-driven immunosuppression locally and restore immune cell function and activity.  To address this need, the primary research objective of this proposal is to engineer biomaterials to modulate the local hypoxic environment to understand immune cell function and activity.  To achieve this goal, this proposal has three aims: 1) Design injectable oxygen-generating cryogel scaffolds to controllably deliver oxygen, 2) Engineer a B16-F10 melanoma tumor microenvironment in three-dimension and deliver oxygen locally to modulate inherent and tumor-induced hypoxia, and 3) Disrupt hypoxia and modulate oxygen tension to understand how local oxygenation can regulate dendritic cell survival and function and impact their activity in an in-vitro ovalbumin (B16-F10/OVA) melanoma model.  The long-term educational goal of the proposal is to promote and train the next generation of scientists to work in academia, industry and clinical settings developing innovative biomaterials to improve human quality of life. The major aims of this program are: 1) Introduce K-12 students to Biomaterials Science (develop a hands-on science curriculum, implement practical research experience, and foster STEM field trips to campus), 2) Enhance undergraduate research exposure and experience to underrepresented students (Hispanic, African-American, and female), and 3) Expand the Northeastern University co-op model to include graduate and academic lab experiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Protein evolution is key to how germs become resistant to drugs, for example.  As another example, engineers can apply the evolution of new protein functions to help break down oil spills.  Predicting these adaptive changes in advance would greatly enhance our understanding of adaptation but would also open the door for new biological tools to confront environmental challenges.  This project will develop computational tools to help scientists both predict and understand how proteins evolve.  To do so, the researchers are experimentally studying the evolution of brightly colored proteins isolated from coral.  They are then using the information from these experimental studies to develop general computational models to understand and predict protein evolution.  Such tools will be powerful, enabling both more effective protein engineering and intervention in the evolution of undesired features such as drug-resistance.  Finally, the project is designed to provide opportunities for high school STEM teachers in Oregon to directly participate in the research. Teacher research experiences demonstrably improve educational outcomes in STEM classrooms. <br/><br/>As an experimental model for protein evolution, the researchers are studying a collection of possible evolutionary trajectories between an ancestral and modern green fluorescent protein (GFP)-like protein from a coral in the genus Favia. The ancestral protein was green; the modern protein is red.  This phenotypic change was achieved through 15 historical substitutions. The researchers are constructing all combinations of these mutations and characterizing the fluorescence of each genotype.  This will allow them to map the collection of possible trajectories connecting the starting and end states. In parallel, they are developing computational tools to dissect epistasis, to describe connectivity, and to predict unmeasured phenotypes.  This work will provide: 1) A publicly available, high-dimensional genotype-phenotype map covering the evolution of a new protein function; 2) Powerful software for studies of evolutionary trajectories; and 3) Deep insight into the determinants of protein evolutionary trajectories in high-dimensional genotype-phenotype maps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In cities and towns in low- and middle-income countries, water, sanitation, and electricity services are provided through a patchwork of options: water may be provided only a few times a week through pipes, while houses use groundwater in the interim; electricity may be delivered through unreliable grids combined with decentralized solar home systems. At the same time, utilities in high-income countries are confronting changes in their industries: water and electricity utilities need to generate revenue while also encouraging conservation; wastewater facilities are transitioning from treatment and disposal to recovery of energy and nutrients. This presents an exciting opportunity to reimagine the future of these utilities. The forefront of innovation is occurring in low-income but rapidly developing cities like Nairobi, Kenya, which are open to new ideas given their more limited previous investments in centralized infrastructure. <br/><br/>The IRES project will engage seventeen students over the course of three years to spend 10-12 weeks working alongside collaborators in Nairobi, Kenya, including researchers from the University of Nairobi and Strathmore University. The research focuses on addressing the common challenges faced by water, electricity, and sanitation utilities in rapidly changing cities. Example projects include: designing a sensing system for electric vehicles to provide grid balancing in Kenya; comparing the environmental and human health impacts of neighborhood- and city-wide human waste management options; improving water supply operations and planning; and quantifying the flexibility of industrial electricity consumption in Kenya. Students will be recruited from multiple disciplines, with a focus on ensuring participation by students traditionally underrepresented in STEM. To prepare for the summer spent in Kenya, students will enroll in a one-credit course. Projects will be designed such that students have clear objectives and can accomplish data collection and analysis within the given timespan, and integrate their project into their overall student experience. Students will also have the opportunity for professional development, including engaging with industries and government in Kenya and participating in a one-week workshop on writing and data presentation.

As dissolved magmatic species H2O and CO2 exsolve and produce a separate vapor phase, magma buoyancy and magma ascent rate increase. Bubble expansion driven by decompression accelerates vesiculation, further increasing magma ascent rate, and thereby the potential for increasing conduit overpressure. Thus, the processes governing volatile exsolution and outgassing, and particularly the timing of initial vapor phase nucleation with respect to depth in the conduit, control a magma's explosive potential. A key unresolved aspect of eruption of crystal-poor silicic magmas is whether bubble nucleation occurs homogeneously (in the bulk fluid) or heterogeneously (aided by a substrate). The distinction is important because homogeneous bubble nucleation requires substantively larger pressure overstepping, or supersaturation than heterogeneous bubble nucleation.  Magnetite crystals are known to enhance the rate of bubble nucleation by providing energetically-favorable substrates, and yet failure to detect a sufficiently high abundance of these crystals in natural pumice has supported the inference that bubble nucleation occurs homogenously. However when numerical ascent models are supplied with measured bubble number densities and executed specifying homogeneous bubble nucleation, the predicted decompression and ascent rates are not only inconsistent with independent assessments but also present physical paradoxes. This study explores the possibility that nanometer sized magnetite particles are present in magmas prior to eruption, and that these crystals trigger bubble nucleation at much lower supersaturation values (i.e., at greater depth in the plumbing system) than would occur in their absence. This proposal provides educational opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and highlights participation of under-represented minorities at the University of Hawaii and Montclair State University (NJ). Professional development for Natural Science educators will be provided through a series of workshops focusing on local geology, volcanology, and Earth processes operating over short and long time scales.<br/><br/>This project addresses the question: do bubbles nucleate homogeneously or heterogeneously in explosively erupting rhyolite magma? The objectives of the work to be undertaken are to ascertain whether plinian rhyolite pumices contain nano-scale titanomagnetite crystals in numerical abundances that rival those of bubbles and to quantify the potential influence of titanomagnetite crystals in bubble nucleation. Addressing these issues is critical for understanding eruptive processes at a fundamental level and is of practical significance in the numerical modeling of conduit flow dynamics and thus assessment of volcanic hazard. The work plan centers around two tasks: (a) applying techniques of rock magnetism to characterize the number density and size distribution of titanomagnetite crystals in nominally aphyric pumice clasts spanning a range in bubble interconnectivity; and (b) performing novel laboratory crystallization experiments utilizing fO2 modulation to isolate the influence of titanomagnetite from other variables. Magnetic characterization (resolving the magnetic domain states, particle number densities, and size distributions of submicron titanomagnetite crystals) is promising because it lowers the detection limit of sparse Fe-Ti oxides by several orders of magnitude relative to traditional electron microprobe imaging. Pairwise measurement of clast permeability, to be obtained for a suite of natural rhyolites spanning a range in eruption parameters and textural attributes, will facilitate determination of magnetite-bubble nucleation chronology. In an experimental task, magnetite stability will be manipulated using ambient fO2 in order to generate rhyolite magma containing populations of magnetite crystals that span large ranges in number density and volume fraction. A subsequent vesiculation step will evaluate the quantitative control of magnetite nanoparticle number density on the bubble-formation process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Several nanomedicines have been approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration, and more are under rigorous clinical studies. However, nearly all synthetic nanomaterials are quickly cleared in the bloodstream of patients after systemic administration, limiting their biomedical applications. In the blood, plasma proteins immediately adsorb onto nanomaterial surfaces. Some of the adsorbed proteins mark nanomaterials as foreign invaders, like bacteria, and this results in their clearance by the host cells. The rational design of long circulating nanomaterials depends on a thorough understanding of the interactions among nanomaterials, proteins, and cells. Currently, there is a dearth of systematic study of these interactions. The research team will establish a comprehensive understanding of nanomaterial-protein-cell interactions for developing a new generation of polymers. When grafted onto nanomaterials, these polymers are expected to dramatically extend the blood circulation of nanomaterials by minimizing protein adsorption and controlling the kinetics of nanomaterial-cell interactions in the blood flow. Ultra-long circulating nanomaterials may have tremendous societal benefits by improving the delivery of therapeutics. The polymer may also be used as an antifouling coating for insulin pump catheters, dialysis membranes, neural electrodes, and materials in direct contact with microbial environments. The knowledge gained through this research will be integrated with educational and outreach activities to inspire students to pursue high-level education in science, technology, engineering and math. Furthermore, the research team will engage kindergarten children in the use of materials science as an investigative tool and thereby explore the impact of early scientific education on students. <br/><br/>Cloaking nanomaterials with a grafted polymer layer is the most widely used approach to extend nanomaterials blood circulation. However, the circulation half-lives of nearly all synthetic nanomaterials are less than a few hours, restricting their applications. A new generation of stealth cloaks that enable ultra-long circulation of nanomaterials will open the door for new applications. The objectives of this proposal are to (i) achieve an in-depth understanding of nanomaterial-protein-cell interactions and (ii) develop an innovative zwitterionic polyether cloak with controlled dynamic surface morphology to efficiently reduce protein adsorption and complement activation on nanomaterials, and interfere with nanomaterial-cell interactions for generating ultra-long circulating nanomaterials. These objectives cannot be fully achieved using existing zwitterionic polymers. The rationale of this proposal is based on the novel findings that liver sinusoidal endothelial cells can be as important as Kupffer cells in clearing some types of nanomaterials, and that the fluctuation of grafted chains kinetically affect nanomaterial-protein interactions, decreasing nanomaterial clearance by cells in the liver, especially liver sinusoidal endothelial cells.

This project develops methods that ensure that robots continue to be safe even as they learn and adapt to unexpected changes in their environment. By enabling robots to be cognizant of their uncertainty, these methods can help robots operate more safely. Further, the methods will enable robots to be adaptive to unforeseen changes in their environment. These methods will be applied to autonomous driving, to enable robots to operate safely on surfaces with different levels of friction or on uneven terrain that might otherwise be unsafe to operate on. Such methods will enable safer autonomous vehicles for city driving in poor weather conditions, as well as for operating in off-road settings for search and rescue operations, patrol vehicles to detect animal poachers, and for other applications.<br/><br/>This research develops a set of methods for uncertainty-aware safe robot learning. These methods will enable a robot to estimate the uncertainty of the effect of its actions; based on the estimated uncertainty, the robot will determine how to improve its performance while operating safely and cautiously. Furthermore, these methods will use the estimated uncertainty to determine how the robot should adapt its parameters to efficiently respond to environmental changes. The methods in this project will operate on complex policy classes such as those represented by neural networks trained with deep reinforcement learning.

This, in turn, reduces the amount of atmospheric carbon dioxide that is taken up by the high-latitude oceans. These observations raise a number of fascinating and hitherto unanswered questions, namely: what are the major sources of iron to the Southern Ocean? How resilient or variable is the supply of iron from these sources over geologic time? How has the iron cycle responded to long-term changes in Earth's climate? Have changes in the iron cycle influenced those of other nutrients, such as silica? This project will address these questions by means of a multifaceted approach examining the origin of the sediment, deposition rates, and quantification of iron sources therein. The detailed records obtained will be used to examine how changes in ocean nutrient cycles relate to the major tectonic, climatic, and biogeochemical reorganizations that have occurred over the past 66 million years ago. The holistic framework used will consider the interplay of these major Earth system processes and quantify their individual roles in shaping iron delivery to the largest iron-limited biome on Earth. <br/><br/>This project will quantify the major sources of iron to the Southern Ocean and how they changed in space and time, based on the geochemistry of metal-rich deep-sea clay sequences drilled by the International Ocean Discovery Program. This will be achieved by combining statistical modeling of the origin of the clay with radiometrically-constrained deposition rates and explicit quantification of iron sources therein. The resultant reconstructions will be used to test hypotheses regarding: the significance of hydrothermally-derived iron to the high-latitude oceans over the Cenozoic; how the opening of tectonic gateways redistributed deeply-sourced iron within the Southern Ocean; how the supply of dust-derived iron changed as Australia became a desert; and, if there were changes in the iron cycle associated with the proliferation of diatoms.

Economic inequality often leads to social conflicts which in turn is destructive of the economy.  The relationship between economic inequality and social conflict is complex; social conflict does not always rise with inequality.  While economic inequality increases the gain from conflict, it also increases the cost of such conflict.   It is not clear why inequality leads to social conflict and economic destruction on one context and not another.  This research project combines insights from economics, psychology, and other social sciences to develop a theory to explain the relationship between economic inequality and social conflict.   Several social and political conflicts (phenomena) can be explained with this model. Understanding the forms social conflict can take is of importance to academics as well as policy makers who may craft better policies to mitigate the effects of such inequalities.  By providing a robust explanation of the sources of social conflicts and how to reduce them, this research project will provide inputs into policies to reduce social conflicts and hence increase economic growth and prosperity.<br/><br/><br/>This research project extends the theory of socially dependent aspirations to the study of economic inequality and social conflict.  Social surroundings affect individual's preferences through the setting of individual aspirations as the threshold between achievement and failure.  Individual's growth can be enhanced by achieving their aspirations but may also be frustrated if the aspirations are not achievable.  Because aspirations are generated by social surroundings, this leads to the interplay between the distributional character of economic development and individual behavior.  With relatively moderate inequality, aspirations are achievable, and resources are expended to achieve them; when inequality is high agents give up on achieving their economic aspirations and turn to other components of their aspirations vector.  The theoretical model can explain why direct class conflict is a relatively rare phenomenon.  This research will apply this concept to the study of contemporary social conflicts and other phenomena, such as racism and xenophobia.  The results of this research project will provide a better understanding of the sources of social conflicts and provide inputs into policies to reduce them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how such things control metal solubility, particularly for Cu, is important for a number of reasons. It helps researchers understand potential driving mechanisms for core formation in terrestrial planets, or the conditions that lead to the formation of economically important metallogenic ore deposits. It's also key to understanding how volcanic degassing may impact metal emissions to the atmosphere. This study proposes to use synchrotron-based X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy of natural and synthetic magmatic glasses with the goal of providing the first direct, experimental constraints on the speciation of Cu in terrestrial melts. XAFS is currently the only methodology available for directly measuring Cu speciation in magmatic glasses at natural concentrations with high spatial resolution. In addition to the scientific goal of constraining which Cu species exist in melts, this work will broaden the participation of minority students in geoscience, and train students in state-of-the-art experimental and analytical techniques.<br/><br/>This will be achieved through three overlapping projects. Project 1 will include copper speciation measurements of synthetic basaltic glasses that are produced at controlled sulfur and oxygen conditions. This suite of synthetic glasses will have both oxygen and sulfur fugacity carefully controlled and will then be analyzed for changes in Cu speciation using XAFS. Project 2 includes Cu speciation measurements of natural glasses sampled from volcanic systems. This project targets natural samples from a sulfide-dominated system with H2O-poor melts (using samples collected from the Kilauea summit vent between 2008 and present), samples from a sulfide-dominated system with higher-H2O melts (from a basaltic cinder cone in the southern Cascade Range), and from sulfate dominated volcanics from both the southern Cascades Range and the Colima Graben in western Mexico. Project 3 will focus on developing advanced, synchrotron-based spectroscopic techniques for Cu K-edge XAFS of magmatic glasses, which will be applied to samples available from Projects 1 and 2, with a focus on developing High Energy-Resolution Fluorescence Detected XAFS (HERFD-XAFS) techniques for the analysis of Cu in geologic materials and magmatic glasses specifically. Such new HERFD-XAFS techniques hold the promise of providing superior spectroscopic sensitivity and resolution compared to conventional XAFS methods for uniquely constraining the copper ligands are present in these samples. These proposed measurements will be the first application of these methods to magmatic glasses and will establish a new database of spectroscopic measurements that will be available to the petrology community. Together, this suite of studies will significantly contribute to our understanding of metal solubility and transport in magmatic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this context, Terahertz (THz) band (0.1 - 10 THz) communication is envisioned as a key wireless technology for the next decade. For many decades, the lack of compact and efficient THz transceivers able to work at room temperature has hampered the use of the THz band for practical applications. However, many recent device technology advancements are finally closing the so-called THz gap. From the communication perspective, there are mainly two sets of challenges to overcome: (i) due to the higher carrier frequency (at least hundreds of GHz), the propagation of THz signals in realistic scenarios is extremely challenging and (ii) due to the much larger bandwidth (at least tens of GHz), synchronization and communication with ultra-broadband signals in the presence of phase noise and other hardware limitations, are unsolved problems. Together, these introduce further challenges across the protocol stack, which need to be overcome in order to enable the networks of tomorrow.<br/><br/>The objective of the project is to demonstrate the truths and debunk the myths about THz communication networks. The targeted breakthrough is to prove the feasibility of ultra-broadband communication networks at THz frequencies, by following a bottom-up approach and through a closed-loop combination of mathematical modeling, numerical simulation and experimental evaluation. For the latter, the project will leverage the Ultra-Broadband Networking Systems Test-bed, a newly established first-of-its-kind communication and networking test-bed at the University at Buffalo (UB), able to support ultra-broadband links (up to 32 GHz bandwidth) at 60 GHz, 240 GHz and 1 THz. The proposed work has been divided into four intertwined thrusts: (i) development of stochastic multi-path channel models for directional THz communications in indoor and outdoor scenarios; (ii) design, implementation and testing of physical layer techniques able to maximally utilize the available bandwidth at THz frequencies, including phase noise estimation and synchronization algorithms, ultra-broadband modulations and ultra-massive MIMO communication schemes; (iii) development of link layer solutions for ultra-broadband networks, including expedited neighbor discovery algorithms and multi-hop relaying strategies; and (iv) an integrated research and education plan aimed at creating an exciting environment at UB for the development of THz communications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding these hazardous events requires developing mathematical model descriptions of sliding friction and fault rupture. Earthquake forecasting relies on these models, which are constrained by laboratory data and assume phenomenological laws. However, model predictions are highly sensitive to the chosen laws. The PI recently developed a new analytical approach to examine such sensitivities. He demonstrated that existing models of earthquake nucleation and slip may preclude a minimum nucleation size (or minimum earthquake size). Such a minimum size was thought to be required in prior fault models. Here, the PI and his team extend this work to unify existing phenomenological laws for fault friction and the understanding of dynamic rupture nucleation. The expected solution can realign the theoretical framework of earthquake physics with growing observational evidence that threatens the paradigm of a minimum earthquake size. Consequently, this project has critical implications for earthquake modeling and forecasting. It also provides support for a graduate student and a postdoctoral associate. <br/><br/>This project addresses the fundamentals of the nucleation and propagation of an earthquake-generating fault rupture. Theoretical models of fault rupture are often based on so-called rate- and state-dependent friction laws, where fault strength depends on the slip rate of the host rock as well as its sliding history, or state. Our understanding of the seismological implications of earthquake nucleation and sliding friction relies on these phenomenological laws. Traditionally, these laws are thought to imply that a minimum fault size is necessary to nucleate an earthquake. An increasing body of experimental friction data has led to several formulations for frictional strength evolution. However, these different formulations produce disparate model predictions for earthquake nucleation. The PI recently developed a new analytical perspective in which the occurrence of slip instability and earthquake nucleation in previous formulations are end-members of a non-linear solution. This approach moves past the classic linear perturbation analysis and eliminates the need for a minimum nucleation size. Here, the PI and his team extend this work to a generalized form of the rate- and state-dependent friction law that advances and unifies the understanding of the so-called aging and slip laws. In this effort, the team examines previous and new descriptions of sliding friction, their role in models of the earthquake process and their seismological implications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through a series of coordinated international research cruises anticipated for the summers of 2020 and 2021, in different regions of the Arctic Ocean, SAS will provide important baseline information about the Arctic ocean ecosystem, carbon system, and physical environment necessary to understand and predict the impacts of ongoing environmental change on the Arctic.  This workshop will plan coordinated field sampling, international data sharing, education including graduate student participation, post field-season data synthesis, public outreach, and involvement of indigenous communities.  The workshop will sponsor the participation of a group of early career scientists.  US scientists are key participants in the planning of the SAS and will lead this workshop, promoting US leadership in Arctic science.  The SAS will engage the general public in Arctic research, increase science literacy and will include multiple audiences (early career, educators, under-represented groups) in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM) research and careers. The outcomes of the SAS field effort will provide baseline understanding of the Arctic system that can be used by national and international policy makers to effectively plan and manage human activities in the Arctic, such as transportation, resource development, and, potentially, commercial fishing.  <br/><br/>Understanding of the Arctic Ocean ecosystem and carbon system, their dependencies on physical drivers, and their interactions with neighboring shelves and ocean regions remains inadequate to project how environmental change may modify these systems on a Pan-Arctic scale.  The Synoptic Arctic Survey (SAS) is an international program envisioned to mount a coordinated, multi-nation, field-based effort on a Pan Arctic scale quasi-synoptically over one-two summers to achieve the baseline understanding of the fundamental structure and function of the linked carbon-ecosystem-physical systems that will permit detection of ongoing and future changes.  The SAS is focused on a single overarching question, ""What are the present state and major ongoing transformations of the Arctic marine system?"". The field effort would provide the parameters needed to project future trajectories of change both conceptually and through coupled physical-chemical-biological modeling.  It is envisioned that the effort, or parts of the effort, would be continued on decadal scales to detect change.  This grant provides resources to host an international, open-to-all 2-day planning workshop and a follow on 1-day planning and writing workshop for the US SAS Scientific Steering Committee to be held in Woods Hole, MA in May 2019. The overall goals of the workshop include promoting interest and participation in the SAS from US and international scientists (especially early career scientists), designing a concrete international implementation that expands on the present international Science and Implementation Plan, discuss the planned years of deployment, and engage interested US and international program managers. For the US only, further goals include codifying and writing a US Implementation Plan and identifying a strategy for activities and proposals that would lead to US participation in the SAS.

Egg freezing, the foremost fertility preservation technology, extends the reproductive life span by preserving a woman's fertility beyond the limits of her reproductive years. Rather than treat the condition of infertility in women, egg freezing anticipates age-related infertility in otherwise healthy women of reproductive age. Techniques such as egg freezing are now being developed and marketed as a potential reconciliation of motherhood and professional work by adjusting women's reproductive timelines to synchronize with career trajectories. While egg freezing appears to give women more control over their lives by altering the timing of reproduction, it does so in a social context that emphasizes motherhood and where the conditions of professional work often create irreconcilable time conflicts between career advancement and family formation. Such new technologies also appear in a medical context that promotes health and the prevention of illness through invasive biomedical interventions. This project examines this tension at the crux of debates regarding, on the one hand, claims about women's expanding agency, and on the other, the persistent messaging suggesting motherhood as essential to their identity.  Findings from this project will inform the medical and public health professions, particularly in the field of reproductive medicine, regarding their work using new technologies. In addition, this project will be useful to policy-makers concerned with eligibility for and accessibility to egg freezing by providing insight into women's motivations, experiences, and perspectives on fertility preservation strategies. Findings will also inform societal conversations regarding the complex relationships between fertility preservation, gender inequality in the workplace and the issue of work-family conflict.<br/><br/><br/>This dissertation employs a qualitative mixed-methods design to address two research questions. First, the project will examine articles published in clinical journals in the field of reproductive medicine, popular women's and business magazines, and newspapers since 1980 to trace how professional and media claims have helped establish egg freezing as an elective, social or lifestyle choice, thus extending to a new population technologies originally developed for women with compromised fertility due to illness or other medical issues. Second, the project will conduct ethnographic observation at educational and marketing events aimed at promoting fertility preservation.  Third, the project will conduct 80 in-depth, qualitative interviews with experts in the field of reproductive medicine, women who use egg freezing, and a range of actors who promote fertility preservation techniques in three United States cities that are major destinations for fertility services.  The project will analyze all data using both open and structured coding.  Findings from the project will inform sociological theories related to gender, family, and the workplace, particularly those theories concerning work-family conflict and women's life course in the 21st century.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project focuses on three, key areas: 1) the types of scientific evidence used in litigation and how that evidence influences judicial decisions; 2) the factors that lead litigants to seek scientific information for use in the courtroom, as well as the factors that motivate scientists to provide that information; and 3) how uncertainties in environmental science are framed and addressed in legal disputes. This project has the potential to transform our understanding of how science is introduced, discussed, framed, and used in the judicial branch and, more broadly, in governmental policymaking. <br/><br/>This project will use both qualitative and quantitative methods to study about 400 lawsuits that have addressed environmental  matters between 1990 and 2018. There will be a systematic review of the briefs and decisions from these cases, complemented by in-depth interviews with a sample of individuals who participated in the cases.  The study will link the defining factors of the cases (e.g., year, type of litigants, location, legal issue, scientific issue, and judicial decision) to the outcomes of interest.  Doing so will facilitate an investigation of how litigants and the courts are reacting to scientific advances and to efforts by scientists to communicate their work in more accessible ways to nonscientific audiences.  By linking the characteristics of the scientific evidence to the outcomes of cases, the research permits future litigants to better understand how scientific information can be more effectively incorporated in legal reasoning and argumentation.  In turn, courts' decisions may reflect a stronger link between science and legal reasoning.  Furthermore, the results of this research can be utilized by funding agencies to better support research in this area. By characterizing the demand for and supply of environmental science in the courtroom, this project bridges the gaps between science, law, and public policy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Paradoxically rivers fix political boundaries yet shift unpredictably across their floodplains, posing problems of jurisdiction and questions of international sovereignty. Additionally, governments manipulated rivers for irrigation, changing river channels so drastically that they no longer adhere to the boundaries they supposedly demarcate. This research examines how rivers have shaped landscapes of belonging and exclusion by focusing on socially differentiated river communities whose shared boundaries shifted when rivers shifted. In response, these communities formed alliances and negotiated conflicts among one another. The doctoral student will evaluate how communities are differentially impacted by contemporary water controversies such as drought and river restoration. Findings will be disseminated to water managers, conservation groups, and the public through publication of written materials in regional outlets and a broadly accessible book. Findings and oral history interviews will be converted into digital narratives to contribute to public debate about the contemporary legacy of past river use and development and can serve as instructional material in classrooms. Results will be shared with the relevant communities. As a Doctoral Dissertation Research Improvement award, this project will provide support to enable a promising graduate student to establish an independent research career.<br/><br/>Through its focus on the physical manifestation of boundaries, this project will reveal how power has been routed through rivers to shape landscapes of belonging and exclusion for different social communities. Integrating ideas from environmental history, political ecology, and borderlands studies, the doctoral student will investigate: (1) how river development in the form of dams, canals, and reservoirs made and re-made territorial boundaries separating Native American and African-American river communities; and (2) how these communities responded to shifting river boundaries through alliances, oppositions, and internal divisions to remain rooted to an increasingly managed landscape.  National archival material will demonstrate how river development caused these boundaries to shift, while local archival collections and oral history interviews will demonstrate how these local communities responded in turn.  Case studies will focus on communities that have been historically divided by changing boundaries set by this transnational, dynamic, and essential river.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They influence global climate, volcanic eruptions, biosphere properties, and the mechanical behavior of deep Earth materials. Although earthquake and volcanic hazards are linked to the abundance and distribution of these elements in fluid and mineral phases, critical gaps exist regarding the budgets and fluxes of halogens in the Earth's interior. In particular, large uncertainties remain on the quantities of halogens that are recycled at depth during subduction of seawater-rich tectonic plates, a process that currently occurs along 55,000 km of oceanic trenches worldwide. The best rock samples to study the budget of subducted tectonic plates, and their consequences on earthquake and volcanic hazards, are analogs of subducted oceanic plates called eclogites. However, halogen analyses of subduction-derived eclogites have been historically hampered by technical challenges, limiting our ability to correctly define halogen fluxes on Earth. Here we propose a novel combination of advanced analytical and imaging techniques to provide unique constraints on the halogen budget of subducting plates. The goal is to answer the following questions: how are halogens distributed in subducted plates, and how does their distribution influence societal hazards linked to subduction zones worldwide? The project will provide an opportunity for an internship for a student from a STEM-underrepresented group to work at Woods Hole and outreach efforts by the principal investigator.<br/><br/>Oceanic plates are created at mid-ocean ridges and recycled at depth in subduction zones, carrying back large amounts of halogens into the Earth?s mantle. Previous studies have made significant advances in understanding the dehydration and melting reactions that take place in subducting plates, but estimates of elemental fluxes remain largely debated. In particular, although bulk measurements of halogens provide valuable information into elemental cycling, the contributions from crystal grains, grain boundaries, fluid inclusions and incipient alteration cannot be distinguished through that technique and can lead to severely skewed estimates of halogen fluxes on Earth. Here we propose to take advantage of recent technical developments led by the PI at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution ion microprobe facility to provide, for the first time, an in-situ distribution map of halogens in subducted eclogites. We will use a novel combination of techniques - in-situ SIMS; micro-CT scanning; ion chromatography; pyrohydrolysis - to quantify the contribution from crystal grains, grain boundaries, fluid inclusions and incipient alteration in eclogite samples representative of various subduction conditions worldwide. Using fresh and well-characterized samples from these localities, we will determine how halogen distribution may vary in subduction zones and calculate new halogen fluxes. This combination of techniques has never been proposed before, is highly complementary to bulk approaches that have been historically used, and will provide critical insight into halogen fluxes in subduction zones. The PI will participate in a WHOI program that provides internships for students who are from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

And one area of social life where ritual is most critical is in the disposition of a community's dead. among This is of particular concern for communities that have been displaced by conflict, where death rates are exceptionally high, and individuals face insecurity and a daunting scarcity of physical and legal resources that challenge the social order. The research supported by this award, which supports the training of a graduate student in scientific methods of rigorous data collection and analysis, asks how host societies deal with the high number of displaced migrants' deaths, and what role mortuary and funerary practices have for displaced communities. According to the UNHCR, the world is witnessing the highest level of forced migration on record, making this a particularly appropriate time to examine this question. In addition to providing funding for the training of a graduate student in anthropology, the project would improve scientific understanding by broadly disseminating its findings to organizations invested in discovering more effective means of delivering humanitarian aid. The project also broadens the participation of groups historically underrepresented in science, and builds capacity and scientific infrastructure through international cooperation among scientific research communities.<br/><br/>Foroogh Farhang, under the supervision of Dr. Jessica Winegar of Northwestern University, explores the extent to which mortuary and funerary practices are impacted by war and displacement, and what resources, networks, rituals, and relationships are marshaled in the burial and propitiation of the dead. The research takes place in Lebanon, where after seven years of civil war in neighboring Syria, displaced Syrians are the first refugee community with no formal camps and cemeteries. They have faced the increasingly stark challenges of securing one of the scarce number of burial sites and, further, holding a proper funeral for their dead. A lack of burial spaces, in conjunction with increasing restrictions on crossing the Lebanon-Syria border, have mobilized networks of Syrian burials within the borders of Lebanon and on the route from Lebanon to Syria. Because this involves such a sizable population, and the issue is so significantly culturally, this site proves an ideal laboratory for understanding what variables aid and inhibit cultural integration. Through in-depth, long-term, and on-site ethnographic fieldwork on people's mobility within Lebanon and between Lebanon and Syria, data will be collected through interviews, participant observation, life histories, and media research among representative samples of refugees, governmental and non-governmental staff, and local leaders and community members. Data will be subjected to thematic and content analysis in order to identify, quantify, and evaluate relevant codes and themes. This study draws upon classic anthropological concerns with ritual and death to examine whether its theoretical assumptions are influenced by variables that are acutely apparent in contemporary contexts marked by war, migration, refugee integration, and transnational NGOs. This research will contribute to debates in anthropology and the social sciences more broadly about mortuary and funerary practices, governance, mobility, and humanitarianism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will further enhance the benefits of wind energy and provide guidance in overcoming its challenges. According to the DOE's Wind Vision Report, wind power can be a cost-effective renewable energy source. At the land-based utility-scale, wind is one of the lowest-priced energy sources available today. It has employed 100,000 workers in 2016 and by 2050 it is expected to employ 600,000 workers. Furthermore, researchers estimate that wind power generation in 2013 reduced power-sector water consumption by 36.5 billion gallons. It has reduced the direct power sector carbon dioxide emission by 115 million metric tons, sulfur dioxide emission by 157,000 metric tons, and nitrogen oxides by 97,000 metric tons in 2013 alone. Searching the product-market fit will improve the possibility of incorporating wake-control technologies in the marketplace. Additional applications of this technology can be found in naval defense, where submarine wakes should be concealed, as well as airline traffic control, where airplane wakes need to be dispersed rapidly. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project technology utilizes instantaneous wake location as a feedback input to a closed-loop control algorithm that manipulates available turbine parameters (such as pitch, speed, and power control) to steer the wake to a desired location. Individual wind turbine wake is a fundamental building block of the complex flow structure in a wind farm. It has been observed that an upwind turbine wake reduces downwind turbine power generation by 40%. As a result, wake control or manipulation provides an unprecedented opportunity to improve wind farm output as a whole, in contrast to the limited benefits of improving individual turbine efficiency. Texas Tech University's wake control algorithm can be incorporated in existing wind farms and can function by altering existing control parameters. This technology has been tested at the wind-tunnel based Hyper Accelerated Wake Kinematics Simulation (HAWKS) platform. The HAWKS platform is capable of emulating full-scale wake detection and steering. Such wake steering would potentially increase power generated by downwind turbines, increasing wind farm power generation as a whole. This increase in power generation increases revenue potential, especially in a grid-price bidding scenario for a low wind speed forecast.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Resources in Thingpedia can be connected together using ThingTalk, a high-level virtual assistant language.  Another key contribution will be the Linguistic User Interface Network (LUInet) that can understand how to operate the world's digital interfaces in natural language.  LUInet uses deep learning to translate natural language into ThingTalk.  Privacy with fine-grain access control is provided through open-source federated virtual assistants. Transparent third-party sharing is supported by keeping human-understandable contracts and data transactions with a scalable blockchain technology.  <br/><br/>This research contributes to the creation of a decentralized computing ecosystem that protects user privacy and promotes open competition. Natural-language programming expands the utility of computing to ordinary people, reducing the programming bottleneck. All the technologies developed in this project will be made available as open source, supporting further research and development by academia and industry. Thingpedia and the ThingTalk dataset will be an important contribution to natural language processing.

The GRS is focused on early career scientists, and it provides an effective forum for them to discuss research through seminars and poster sessions, exchange ideas and resources informally, and develop their professional network. A notable programmatic activity is a panel discussion on mentoring and career development with the keynote speaker and a diverse group of faculty mentors. The GRS is organized and co-chaired by two post-doctoral fellows, and it serves as a significant career development experience for them as well. <br/><br/>New technology development has accelerated discoveries in chromosome biology in recent years. It has also led to high levels of specialization that have a profound impact, but can also hinder fuller understanding of how the biophysical properties of packaged DNA influence the function, maintenance and propagation of the genetic code. The GRS and GRC serve as a vital link for investigators by facilitating discussion of the latest discoveries in topics such as chromosome organization and the impact on gene regulation, DNA replication and repair in the chromosomal context, meiotic chromosomal organization and segregation, as well as centromeres and chromosome stability. The GRS in particular will facilitate training and professional development of the next generation of scientists, including underrepresented minorities, in the field of chromosome biology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to constrain the iron contents of solid and liquid phases in the early magma ocean. Whether solids rise or sink in a magma depends on their density contrast with the liquid, which is a function of their relative iron contents. The distribution of iron between phases is called partitioning. Quantifying iron partitioning in the early magma ocean is critical to model Earth's mantle evolution toward its present-day structure and composition. Here, the researcher uses computational physics to model at the atomic level the chemistry of iron in the magma. The simulation - called ""ab initio"" because it relies on quantum-mechanics first principles - accounts for the extreme pressures prevailing in the deep magma ocean. The team's state-of-the-art code includes developments which allow calculating the affinity of iron with solid and liquid phases, thus whether minerals rise or sink. This project promotes the training of a graduate student in computational Mineral Physics. It impacts the adjacent fields of Experimental Petrology and Geodynamics, with strong implications for the interpretation of modern geochemical and seismological observations. It also has broad impacts in Materials Science. <br/><br/>Previous work has shown that whether crystals rise or sink in a magma ocean depends critically on the partitioning of iron between liquid and crystalline phases. Yet, the sign of the liquid-crystal density contrast and the vector of geochemical evolution is unknown at the conditions of the deep magma ocean. Here, the PI and his team calculates ab initio the partitioning of iron among coexisting phases throughout the pressure regime of the lower mantle. The project represents a major expansion for the application of density functional theory to the magma ocean. It encompasses studies of end-member compositions and the chemical interaction between liquids and crystals. The team build on their accomplishments in ab initio simulation of Earth's iron-bearing systems - including strong correlation and magnetic entropy - by broadening the scope to account for free energies and element partitioning. Using first principles molecular dynamics coupled with adiabatic switching, they will predict iron partitioning between: 1) liquid and crystalline (Mg,Fe)O , 2) liquid and crystalline (Mg,Fe)SiO3 and 3) a liquid approximating bulk silicate Earth composition and (Mg,Fe)O ferropericlase and (Mg,Fe)SiO3 bridgmanite.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the BATS site however, despite the long history of observations, a mystery remains: When and how is enough nitrogen delivered to surface waters to support the biological production that is observed?  The investigators will use oxygen, nitrate, and micro-turbulence sensors on autonomous underwater gliders to sample continuously for twenty months at the BATS site in an effort to resolve this mystery. Gliders make it possible to measure processes at scales that can't be captured by monthly or biweekly sampling from a ship. Regular sampling by the BATS program will still be essential to the project, however, by providing opportunities for calibration and validation of the glider sensors as well as ship support for glider deployments and recoveries. The project will also leverage existing private funding from the BIOS-SCOPE project, a multi-institutional microbial marine biogeochemistry initiative at BATS, that will provide partial support for glider operations. The investigators will recruit and advise at least two NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) students each year, and will incorporate project themes and data into educational programs at their respective institutions. <br/><br/>This project will apply new technologies to address several factors believed to perpetuate significant underestimates of nitrate delivery and particulate organic carbon (POC) exports in the Sargasso Sea. High-resolution glider-based observations will be used to estimate annual net community production (ANCP) through oxygen mass balance, and new production (NP) through nitrate mass balance, over a period spanning an annual cycle and two consecutive oligotrophic periods. Microstructure measurements will provide much-needed profiles of vertical diffusivity to accurately constrain fluxes of oxygen and nitrate and their variability over the annual cycle. Oxygen/argon ratio measurements will be used as independent estimates of biologically mediated oxygen changes and as constraints on glider-measured rates of oxygen concentration change. Assessments of phytoplankton characteristics by flow cytometry will be used to calibrate the gliders' optical sensors to in situ biological characteristics, so that variability in phytoplankton community structure and biomass can be discerned at the gliders' high temporal resolution and related to simultaneously measured NCP, NP, and physical water column structure, both above and below the euphotic zone. POC exports will be inferred from backscatter inventories in the deeper layers. The sum of observations will enable assessments of relationships among three independently measured proxies for the strength of the biological carbon pump and how the system responds to environmental forcing over the annual cycle, with particular focus on the stratified oligotrophic months.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Employing this methodology, this research project, which is an international coalition between scientists in the US and six European nations, seeks to establish a process that accounts for multiple viewpoints in decision-making on the future of conservation and resource management using sites in the US, Sweden, Spain, and the Netherlands as case studies, with the US site consisting of the Denali National Park and Preserve in Alaska. Selected sites were chosen because protected wilderness areas designations in the US and Europe are among the most ambitious in the world, yet these areas face unprecedented threats from changing socio-ecological dynamics and diverging societal visions for conservation. Common challenges for protected wilderness areas include inconsistent priorities between local and national governments, a need to expand stakeholder involvement in conservation initiatives, and an imbalance between biodiversity conservation goals and economic objectives. Thus, over a three-year period this research will develop processes and forums that link local, national, US, and European policy makers with researchers, civil society members, and the private sector to foster dialogue that seeks to accommodate multiple visions for biodiversity conservation. The project will construct strategies that span interest groups and enable protected area management agencies to develop policy that is responsive to community needs and preferences for future growth using participatory scenario modelling, multi-narrative platforms, knowledge co-creation, and capacity building through local and inter-site knowledge alliances. Research results will deliver useful means and models for advancing policy, developing communities of practice, and contribute to the advancement of scientific literature in biodiversity and social science conservation. The Program found the broader impacts of the work to be strong. These include international collaboration with scientists from six nations (Germany, Spain, the Netherlands, Sweden, the UK, and Switzerland), improving the interaction between local communities; the private sector; conservation groups; and government such that common visions and sustainable policies can be envisioned and enacted to protect wilderness areas. The project also provides training of a postdoctoral researcher in international transdisciplinary conservation work.<br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, this research project involves seven integrated work packages that are designed to engage and learn from various stakeholders and local communities associated with protected wilderness areas to help them collectively identify ways to balance social, ecological, and economic well-being. This approach involves novel strategies for communicating and engaging with inter-site and local site knowledge alliances as well as mobilizing and synthesizing multiple types of knowledge and ways of engaging with and better knowing the benefits and resources of protected areas. A model for inclusive conservation will be developed through site-based, social-ecological inventories, systematic scientific literature reviews, and oral histories of diverse stakeholders including those of environmental managers, indigenous peoples, non-native subsistence users, industry, local businesses, local government, and educators. The hands-on tool, STREAMLINE, will be used to examine the consequences of different scenarios and visions for protected areas that take into account all perspectives. Results will be quantified and visualized in easy-to-use, visually appealing, graphical formats. The work will also include development of experiments to determine how, why, and to what extent values of different stakeholders shift over time. This will be achieved using participatory mapping methods (e.g., Maptionnaire) and the translation of stakeholder visions into potential management strategies that incorporate estimates of uncertainty. An additional goal of the project is to establish workable governance models using social network analysis, characterizing power relationships, and providing for co-creation of knowledge which is essential for viable conservation approaches. Research results will be broadly disseminated to stakeholders and the public via outlets such as factsheets, policy briefs, webinars, film, and festivals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When permafrost warms and thaws, any buried ground ice present melts. This can lead to ground surface caving, changes in terrain, and damage to infrastructure. Permafrost thaw can also change dynamics of carbon cycling and affect near-surface hydrology causing the ground surface to become wetter or drier. To understand how fast and where permafrost is warming, this project supports the ongoing collection of high-quality, long-term data on ground temperature at more than 250 permafrost monitoring sites in Alaska, Siberia, and the Canadian Arctic Archipelago. To refine detection of ground warming, the investigators will supplement some monitoring sites with sensors to directly measure the heat flux between the near-surface permafrost and ground surface. To understand the relationship between permafrost warming and ground surface subsidence, the investigators will also monitor and map geomorphological changes along a transect that runs south to north across sub-Arctic and Arctic Alaska.  <br/><br/>This proposal strengthens the International Network of Thermal State of Permafrost (TSP) Observatories and provides the Global Terrestrial Network for Permafrost (GTN-P) and the NSF Arctic Data Center with a consistent, representative, and high quality standardized long-term data series of selected permafrost parameters. This project will continue to maintain and acquire data from the existing Alaskan and Northwest Canadian network of permafrost observatories for the period 2019 to 2023; continue to develop a sustainable network of permafrost observatories in the Russian Arctic and participate in the acquisition of a comparable set of standardized data from regional observatories; participate in the implementation of the international TSP project as the US contribution to the GTN-P; continue to develop and update a joint Alaska-Russian permafrost temperature database and provide data to other data systems; and monitor the geomorphological impact of permafrost degradation at five surface observation sites. This project will also involve a number of undergraduate students, train one PhD student, mentor a postdoctoral scholar, and support K-12 outreach activities in both Alaska and Russia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project's strategy will also harness the excitement surrounding robotics and computer science, and leverage it with the investigators' exceptional infrastructure for education innovation and outreach to provide new, inspirational educational experiences for students. Finally, the project outcomes can broadly impact a number of other areas that would benefit from the developed novel methodologies, including search and rescue, construction and maintenance, and remote imaging, where the environment is dynamic or changes upon repeated inspection.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to gain a fundamental understanding of the cognition and adaptation needs of an intelligence-driven patient care approach to reduce medical errors. Realizing such an intelligent physical system would allow for augmenting physician capabilities. If one considers an operating room of the future, one can imagine scenarios where data is collected from, and shared with, all medical personnel including the surgeon, the supporting medical technicians, and anesthesiologists. In addition, artificial intelligence could be harnessed to look for unseen patterns in patient care. This operating room of the future will only be possible by establishing a new paradigm that includes medical devices with embedded smart and autonomous features. Such an intelligent physical system would gather knowledge from support personnel, sensors and diagnostics, and interpret physician intent and provide suggestions and diagnostic feedback in real-time. To provide real-world evaluation of this approach, the project will focus on robotic capsule endoscopy, with an intent to have immediate impact in conventional gastroenterology procedures. In pursuit of this goal, this project addresses three research objectives: the first objective focuses on robotic capsule endoscopy perception and control; the second objective formulates the perception and diagnostic support requirements to augment physician performance; and the third objective integrates multimodal, multi-label, temporal data analytics for intelligent physician support.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Logan in the high Arctic.<br/><br/>In 2017, the Mt. Logan ice core was catastrophically destroyed in a storage freezer malfunction at the Canadian Ice Core Archive (University of Alberta). This ill-timed loss occurred when several new critical questions had evolved from recent observations.  The University of Alberta recently secured funding to attempt a new expedition to recover new ice core. <br/><br/>The U.S. researchers have established a collaborative partnership with University of Alberta researchers to participate in all aspects of the ice core recovery, analysis, and interpretation.  A critical first step, however, is a comprehensive, state-of-the-art glaciological study (including geophysical observations and numerical modeling) of the Mt. Logan summit plateau area for potential drill site selection in 2019.  Such modeling is the impetus for the current EAGER request.<br/><br/>Given the low snow accumulation and deep, cold ice (~200m), the Mount Logan plateau may contain some of the oldest Arctic glacier ice on Earth.  The researchers believe this effort will maximize available resources to obtain one of the best long-term climate records in the Arctic.<br/><br/>Before the researchers can realize any benefit from acquiring a new ice core, they must complete some critical background tasks that include: 1) developing bedrock topography maps of the Mt. Logan summit plateau sites; 2) mapping near-surface spatial accumulation rate patterns; 3) tracing internal isochrones at each site; 4) collecting near-surface snow chemistry measurements at each site; and 5) selecting a drill site for a new Mt. Logan ice core.<br/><br/>Recent advancements in drill site selection and ice core processing provide the researchers with a unique opportunity to select an optimal site and obtain a new ice core record that contains decadal to century resolution for more than 30,000 years.   The researchers have experience securing and analyzing high elevation ice cores and the Mt. Logan summit plateau is a difficult place to access and work.  The combination of high skill level among the research team and high potential scientific potential payoff places this request for support in the high risk-high reward category aligned with the EAGER program. <br/><br/>The activities are scientifically important and fit well into the potentially transformative, high-risk but potential high payoff research attributes of the EAGER program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

""Megaripples"" are common features on marine sediments where bottom currents are rapid. In the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, these sand dune-like features are up to half a meter in height, with wavelengths reaching 20 meters. The investigators propose that megaripples act as large filter systems that rapidly convert dissolved and solid organic matter into inorganic carbon and nutrients, and thus influence the biological productivity of coastal waters. They propose to use a one-kilometer long megaripple field in the inlet of Chotawhatchee Bay, in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico, as a natural laboratory for studying these processes. In addition, they will conduct laboratory experiments to investigate the filter processes at a smaller scale. By producing data on the functioning of megaripples, the project addresses a knowledge gap that has implications on our understanding of the cycles of matter in coastal waters. The project offers opportunities for both graduate and undergraduate students in learning state-of-the-art techniques. The students will gain experience in working on high frequency data acquisition and analysis of 'big data'. To enhance outreach, the researchers will develop and teach two courses on Permeable Sediment Biogeochemistry and Aquatic Eddy Covariance Studies for the Saturday at the Sea program offered by Florida State University. Results will be disseminated via scientific journals, conference presentations and public lectures, and directly to the Apalachicola-National Estuarine Research Reserve (NERR), which will make the results available to the other 28 NERR sites. <br/><br/>The two main project objectives are: 1) demonstrate the general function of megaripples as biocatalytical filters, and 2) demonstrate that common inlet megaripples contribute to nutrient retention in coastal bays.  A 1 km long megaripple field in the inlet of Chotawhatchee Bay (wavelengths: ~20 m, amplitudes: 20 to 40 cm) in the northeastern Gulf of Mexico will be used as an in-situ laboratory. Measurements will characterize megaripple topography and the water flowing over them. Salinity and suspended particles are utilized as natural tracers to quantify solute and particle entrainment into the megaripples. This project will deploy non-invasive aquatic eddy covariance instruments equipped with newly developed robust sensors to quantify sedimentary remineralization in the flushed megaripple bed. This technique integrates the benthic oxygen flux over a large section of the megaripple field, while including the natural dynamics of currents and light. Real-time water column measurements with a boat-mounted flow-through analyzer permit rapid quantification of large horizontal gradients of key water column parameters. The in-situ measurements will be combined with laboratory column reactor experiments that quantify nutrient re-mobilization through organic carbon mineralization in flushed megaripple sand. The megaripple field in the inlet of Chotawhatchee Bay is easily accessible from shore and by small boat, expediting instrument deployments and in-situ measurements while reducing project costs. Synthesis of all data will produce a conceptual and quantitative understanding of megaripples as natural biocatalytical filters. Because transport and reaction in megaripples are governed by basic physical and biogeochemical processes, these results will reveal information on the general biogeochemical functioning of megaripples that so far is not available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new data revolution calls for a new data-savvy workforce capable of using data effectively to answer important scientific and practical questions and to communicate the results to a broad audience. These data scientists should have strong technical and leadership skills and the ability to work in teams comprising different and complementary expertise. To meet this training need, the National Science Foundation Innovations of Graduate Education (IGE) award to Tufts University will test an innovative approach to project-based learning, teaching graduate students in data-intensive fields using real datasets to solve real-world problems. This solution-oriented, student-led, team-based, computationally-enriched (SOLSTICE) training environment will offer multidisciplinary team role-play and experience in data analytics and scientific communication. This project will evaluate the effectiveness of the SOLSTICE approach in providing an adaptable method for instructors in a range of fields that use large datasets at diverse institution types. As the SOLSTICE approach is refined, it will pave the way for students to enter the workforce with strong technical skills in data analytics and be effective members of research teams. <br/><br/>The project will answer two overarching research questions: (1) To what extent does the SOLSTICE approach provide opportunities for students to achieve 21st-century data intensive knowledge, skills, and attitudes? and (2) Are there variations in students' achievement over time, across different courses that use the SOLSTICE approach, and across different STEM disciplines? The approach consists of three components: (1) 3D Role Play, in which each student plays the role of Team Lead, Collaborator, and Reviewer in three different interdisciplinary teams aiming to develop, execute and communicate a research project based on authentic secondary data analyses; (2) Feedback on Feedback, which provides students with experience in giving and receiving effective critiques to their peers to strengthen inter-team communication; and (3) Data Analysis Roadmap, which offers knowledge-building guides and examples of key elements for efficient data analysis plans and other documents needed for effective communication of results. The approach will be tested and evaluated in six data-intensive courses in the Friedman School of Nutrition and in the School of Engineering, with approximately 270 participants monitored before, during, and for at least six months after participation in a SOLSTICE-based course. Educational resources will be developed based on successful components to guide replications of the training process, to train faculty in the SOLSTICE approach, and to disseminate it to other STEM fields. <br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education.

Over its five-year duration, the project plans to provide one- to four-year scholarships to 30 students who are pursuing undergraduate degrees in Plant Science-Biotechnology. To increase the persistence of the Scholars in the biotechnology major, scholarships will be linked with effective student support activities, including common course scheduling, peer mentoring, and opportunities for research and/or internships. Scholars will gain workforce experience through field trips, workshops, and career placement services. Fort Valley State University is a historically Black university with a high population of rural, first-generation, and underrepresented students.  Consequently, this project has the potential to broaden participation in STEM, particularly in biological sciences and biotechnology. It will also promote workforce development by developing synergistic partnerships between the University and regional biotechnology industry partners.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase degree completion of low-income, academically high-achieving undergraduates in STEM fields. To meet this goal, the project will recruit students from eight regional high schools and regional community colleges.  These Scholars will join a structured cohort that will engage in targeted academic and career programs that are intended to increase retention and student success. The project will address the following research questions: 1) What motivates academically-talented STEM students from low-income backgrounds, including underrepresented and rural students, to pursue careers in biotechnology, and how do the findings fit into existing literature regarding the motivations of students in STEM fields? 2) Do commonly-accepted findings regarding associations between student engagement with high impact educational practices and improved academic outcomes remain valid within the context of a rural HBCU serving a predominantly low-income, first-generation population of students? 3) Do discernable patterns of behavior exist regarding the utilization of available student support services by low-income, academically-talented students at a rural HBCU? Data will be gathered about student engagement, performance, retention, and characteristics such as changes in science identity and self-efficacy.  Analysis of these data will help to determine which interventions were most effective for motivating and retaining students in STEM programs and promoting their entry into the STEM workforce or STEM graduate programs. The project has the potential to advance knowledge about how undergraduate research projects can support retention of students in STEM majors.

In practice, almost all engineering designs are subject to such unavoidable uncertainties as noise, fabrication process variations and insufficient knowledge about external environments. These uncertainties often cause performance degradations, system failures and sometimes fatal accidents. However, existing design automation software requires massive data samples from time-consuming computer simulations or non-trivial measurement when uncertainties are involved. This project uses electronic and photonic integrated circuits as driving examples, and will develop novel design automation algorithms to improve the performance and reliability under various uncertainties. The education components of this project include creating two graduate courses of uncertainty and data analysis, training future workforce through undergraduate and graduate research. The outreach education and training through the awardee institution and through academic conferences will enable technology and knowledge transfer to a broad community. Although this project targets on applications in electronics and photonics, the developed algorithms and theory will be applicable to many other domains such as autonomous driving, renewable energy systems, and medical imaging. Since uncertainty-aware photonic design automation is still at its early stage, this project will enable a new field of important research. The resulting algorithms and tools will support the foreseeable large-scale photonic integration which will boost the performance of future computing and communication systems. <br/> <br/>The technical goal of this project is to develop novel uncertainty-aware electronic and photonic design automation algorithms that require only a small data set and a very low computational cost in the design flow.  This project will span three research topics: uncertainty-aware simulation, optimization and data-driven variation modeling. Firstly, novel algorithms will be developed to address several long-standing challenges in the forward uncertainty quantification of electronic and photonic circuits, such as the coupled impact of fundamentally different types of uncertainties and long-term probabilistic simulation errors. Secondly, leveraging the developed forward uncertainty simulator, this project will further develop ultra-fast optimization tools to improve the yield of electronic and photonic circuits. The main focus will be investigating large-scale ""non-sampling"" stochastic optimization algorithms. The developed algorithms will enable rigorous yield optimization with ""small"" simulation data sets and thus significantly reduce the software runtime on a computer. Finally, rigorous statistical estimation algorithms will be developed to calibrate critical device model parameters and to extract statistical variability distributions based on limited and noisy indirect circuit-level measurement data. The designed algorithms and prototyping software will be validated by practical design cases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therapeutic failure is due, in part, to tumor cell heterogeneity, derived from both genetic and non-genetic sources, which contributes to therapeutic resistance and tumor progression. Understanding this heterogeneity is the key for the development of targeted cancer-preventative and -therapeutic interventions. One of the currently prevailing models explaining intratumoral heterogeneity is the cancer stem cell (CSC) hypothesis. Oncogene HER2 is a well-studied oncogene known for its role in promoting cancer cell survival and proliferation, and recently implicated in generation and maintenance of CSCs. Thus understanding the HER2 signaling is critical for development of novel strategies for cancer treatment, while tumor growth is a very complicated phenomenon involving many inter-related processes across a wide range of spatial and temporal scales, which makes the mathematical modeling and computation very challenging. This research seeks to employ modeling techniques and computational studies to address complex issues arising from tumor growth at the interface of mathematics, chemical engineering and biology. Successful completion of this project will also have a significant impact on public health, as the research findings can be used to develop diagnostics, prognostics, and therapeutics to more specifically target cancer stem cells. The proposed research of mathematical modeling and experimental studies for cancer cells creates a unique multidisciplinary research environment that attracts both undergraduate and graduate students (especially women and minority students) from all disciplines to join our research team.<br/><br/>With a close integration with experiments, the PI will perform multi-scale modeling and computational investigation of HER2 signaling in modulating CSC population in cancer tumor growth with spatial-temporal dynamics. To better explore HER2 signaling for better understanding the heterogeneity in breast cancer, PI shall develop a multi-scale model coupled cell signaling with cell population to study the dynamics control of CSCs. This control mechanism capitalizes on emerging evidences in literature, and correlates with recent findings from new observed experimental data. It is widely believed that a key mechanism for proper maintenance of a cell lineage to occur is the formation and substance of the stem cell niche, a microenvironment where stem cells reside in a tissue. To explore the CSCs' spatial patterns for tumor growth, PI will also develop a continuum PDE model coupled HER2 signaling with multistage cell lineage models and spatial effects of nutrients. Specific tasks are: (1) to investigate the roles of HER2 signaling in controlling and maintenance of CSCs, and develop and evaluate multi-scale models to explore underlying mechanisms and biological factors to control the balance of tumor growth; (2) to further develop continuous mathematical models to better understand the spatial structures of CSC populations during tumor growth with different effects of various biological factors; (3) to design fast and efficient numerical methods for solving the mathematical models with moving and complex domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The team will record and store logs of the processes many different analysts use to explore a variety of datasets. From these logs of analyst behavior, the team will create models that identify both potentially advantageous and risky working strategies. They will use this model, along with tools designed to detect biases, to build new data analysis tools. The new tools will shape the presentation of data to users and suggest exploration choices to help counter errors and biases.  For example, if past successful analysts, when faced with a similar set of data, performed a particular sequence of operations, the tool might suggest that the current user pursue similar procedures.  The tools and work will be deployed publicly, benefiting individuals who may be less familiar with data science.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this research program is to construct data analytics technology that learns from experts' work in order to improve the experience of novice data scientists.

The effectiveness of VR systems relies on several critical factors, including interaction. Although interaction in real-life includes mutual encounters between two or more individuals through shared tangible objects, most VR interaction to date have not been like that. The goal of this project is to establish a research program that will ultimately shrink the boundary between the real and virtual worlds by incorporating mutual tangible embodied interactions between human users and virtual characters through shared objects that extend from virtual worlds into the real-world. This will increase the seamlessness of the system and the fidelity of the interaction, thereby preventing the technology from being an obstacle or distraction and enabling the user to derive more benefit from the VR experience. The research objectives are as follows: (1) To develop a custom VR system that affords the proposed novel mutual tangible embodied interaction between a human user and a virtual character. (2) To investigate the effects of the proposed form of interaction on user performance and experience in VR through controlled user studies and statistical analyses on the collected data. (3) To impact future VR research by disseminating the findings and reflections.  <br/><br/>In the envisaged custom VR system, the shared objects will be represented in two complementary forms: physical and virtual. The extension of the shared objects from the virtual world into the real world will be achieved through a custom projection surface and custom-developed mechanical systems. The projection surface will be modified so that only a portion of the physical object will be visible to the human user at all times, while the remaining complementary portion will be rendered digitally. The mechanical systems will include physical object parts, 3D printed attachments, microprocessors, actuators, and motion sensors. These mechanical systems will be employed for synchronizing the movements of the physical objects and their virtual counterparts in real time; as one of the agents (human or virtual) affects the corresponding form (physical or virtual) of the shared object (e.g., by moving or rotating it), the effect will be immediately observable on the other form.  Project outcomes will benefit not only the users of VR systems through enhanced experiences with a novel form of interaction but also the researchers through new findings in human-computer interaction. The research will be carried out in three phases. Phase 1 includes the investigation and design refinement of the proposed mutual tangible embodied interaction, including object and transform modality, custom hardware and software, tasks, and performance measures. In Phase 2, iterative development and in-house testing activities will be completed.

However, there is considerable disagreement on how grasslands will respond to environmental change, and the potentially dramatic changes to crop productivity, species invasions, and biodiversity remain unknown. Without a firm understanding of the climatic conditions that caused the spreading of warm-season grasses in the deep past, it is difficult to predict how they will respond in the future. The significant enlargement of grasses' geographic range millions of years ago during the Miocene is the focus of this study. This project is the first to collect data on precipitation and vegetation during the Miocene in South America and to use it to make simulations of ancient climate during this important ecological change. Results are leading to new understanding about how the abundance of warm-season grasses may change in natural and managed landscapes in response to future environmental changes.<br/><br/>The Late Miocene expansion of C4 grasses is one of the most dramatic ecological changes in the past 65 million years. In order to predict how these economically important grasses will respond to future enviornmental change, the factors controlling their past distributions must be understood. In South America, C4 grass expansion was coincident with a strengthening of the South American Summer Monsoon and regional tectonic changes. This project is combining multi-proxy paleovegetation reconstructions with proxy-based paleoclimatic reconstructions and paleoclimatic modeling techniques to understand the linkages between tectonics, climate, and environmental change in South America. Results are leading to new understanding of the conditions under which C4 grasses expanded.

However, the current management strategies for vehicular systems are mainly based on individual-level data knowledge, ignoring rich information from a fleet perspective.  In this project, the investigators design and implement a fleet-oriented management strategy for vehicular systems, which utilizes real-time data from sensors installed in all vehicles to improve the overall performance of the vehicular system. In particular, the investigators aim to improve the taxi system performance by using onboard cameras to detect waiting passengers on streets and share this information with nearby vehicles and dispatch centers to pick up these passengers through a dispatching strategy. The research team will develop a clear understanding of how to design an adaptive autonomous vehicular sensing and dispatching strategy to improve urban mobility efficiency from a fleet-oriented perspective, with potential applications to future fully autonomous fleets. Such an understanding on vehicular sensing and dispatch will improve the quality of the every-day life such as more efficient commute for passengers, and lower energy uses for drivers, and finally improve the environment for the society by low vehicle mileage.<br/><br/>This research develops a fleet-oriented sensing and control framework to  enable seamlessly integration of historical and real-time data within a fleet for adaptive vehicular sensing, modeling, and control. Specifically, this project studies how to best use spatiotemporally-correlated contextual information (e.g., vehicular mobility, service demand, disruptive events) among vehicles. Although such correlations decay over time and distance, it is possible to enable autonomous vehicular sensing, modeling, and control adaptively based on the following research to develop novel services: (i) reconfigurable fleet-wide coordinated sensing by autonomously learning correlated vehicular interactions; (ii) models of mobility phenomena by collectively interpreting implicit data from different vehicles with a combination of deep learning, structured learning, and attribute-based learning; (iii) designs of robust dispatching strategies with uncertainty sets and receding horizon control frameworks by iteratively considering fleet-wide knowledge to improve mobility efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how such things control metal solubility, particularly for Cu, is important for a number of reasons. It helps researchers understand potential driving mechanisms for core formation in terrestrial planets, or the conditions that lead to the formation of economically important metallogenic ore deposits. It's also key to understanding how volcanic degassing may impact metal emissions to the atmosphere. This study proposes to use synchrotron-based X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy of natural and synthetic magmatic glasses with the goal of providing the first direct, experimental constraints on the speciation of Cu in terrestrial melts. XAFS is currently the only methodology available for directly measuring Cu speciation in magmatic glasses at natural concentrations with high spatial resolution. In addition to the scientific goal of constraining which Cu species exist in melts, this work will broaden the participation of minority students in geoscience, and train students in state-of-the-art experimental and analytical techniques.<br/><br/>This will be achieved through three overlapping projects. Project 1 will include copper speciation measurements of synthetic basaltic glasses that are produced at controlled sulfur and oxygen conditions. This suite of synthetic glasses will have both oxygen and sulfur fugacity carefully controlled and will then be analyzed for changes in Cu speciation using XAFS. Project 2 includes Cu speciation measurements of natural glasses sampled from volcanic systems. This project targets natural samples from a sulfide-dominated system with H2O-poor melts (using samples collected from the Kilauea summit vent between 2008 and present), samples from a sulfide-dominated system with higher-H2O melts (from a basaltic cinder cone in the southern Cascade Range), and from sulfate dominated volcanics from both the southern Cascades Range and the Colima Graben in western Mexico. Project 3 will focus on developing advanced, synchrotron-based spectroscopic techniques for Cu K-edge XAFS of magmatic glasses, which will be applied to samples available from Projects 1 and 2, with a focus on developing High Energy-Resolution Fluorescence Detected XAFS (HERFD-XAFS) techniques for the analysis of Cu in geologic materials and magmatic glasses specifically. Such new HERFD-XAFS techniques hold the promise of providing superior spectroscopic sensitivity and resolution compared to conventional XAFS methods for uniquely constraining the copper ligands are present in these samples. These proposed measurements will be the first application of these methods to magmatic glasses and will establish a new database of spectroscopic measurements that will be available to the petrology community.

Marine cyanobacteria are one such key group of organisms, since they supply much of the essential carbon and nitrogen that supports nearly all the rest of the marine food web. Currently, the growth of cyanobacteria is mostly constrained by scarce supplies of the micronutrient element iron, but they are also very sensitive to the ongoing increases in seawater temperature. Preliminary results suggest that warming could partly mitigate the negative effects of iron limitation on marine cyanobacteria. This project examines in depth how these interactions between warming and iron limitation will affect the future ocean carbon and nitrogen cycles, using laboratory culture experiments showing how cyanobacteria respond to simultaneously changing temperature and iron supplies. Both short-term response studies and long-term evolutionary experiments testing for adaptation use a comprehensive set of molecular biology tools targeting genes to proteins. The final goal is to apply the results of these experiments to improve quantitative models predicting how the ocean's carbon and nitrogen cycles, biological productivity, and living resources will respond to a warming future climate. Two graduate students, a postdoc and 3-4 underrepresented undergraduate researchers are supported, and the investigators also mentor summer science interns from largely Hispanic local high schools. <br/><br/>The physiology, biochemistry and biogeography of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and unicellular picocyanobacteria are strongly influenced by temperature, subjecting them to intense selective pressure as the modern ocean steadily warms up. These groups have likewise been rigorously selected under chronic iron (Fe) scarcity, and the availability of this crucial micronutrient is also changing with a shifting climate. This project examines short-term acclimation and long-term evolutionary responses of Fe-stressed marine cyanobacteria to a warmer environment. Preliminary data show that Iron Use Efficiencies (IUE, mols N fixed.hr-1 mol cellular Fe-1) of Fe-limited Trichodesmium increase 4 to 5-fold with a 5oC temperature increase, allowing the cells to much more efficiently leverage scarce available Fe supplies to grow and fix nitrogen. This means that warming can to a large degree mitigate the negative effects of Fe limitation on Trichodesmium, resulting in a modelled 22% increase in global nitrogen fixation by 2100 in a warmer climate. This project aims to uncover the cellular biochemical mechanisms involved in this Fe-limitation/thermal IUE effect in a four-year experimental evolution study of the diazotrophs Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera and the picocyanobacteria Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, under a multi-variate selection matrix of temperature and Fe availability. The objectives are to 1) Assess the long-term adaptive responses of fitness, IUE and physiology to Fe limitation and warming interactions in these four major cyanobacterial groups; 2) Determine the molecular and biochemical mechanisms behind the surprising Fe/warming interactive effect on IUE using genomics, transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics coupled with 'metalloproteomics' determinations of Fe content in critical proteins; 3) Compare and contrast acclimation and adaptation responses to Fe limitation and warming in key cyanobacteria taxa, and 4) Integrate results using a published biogeochemical modeling approach to assess global consequences for marine productivity and nitrogen fixation.  This project offers a mechanistic and predictive understanding of adaptation to Fe and warming co-stressors in a rapidly changing future ocean environment for some of the most important photoautotrophic functional groups in the ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are the location of many societally-relevant hazards, including the generation of Earth's deadliest earthquakes, such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and associated tsunami, and volcanic eruptions such as those at Mt St Helens (1980) and Mt Pinatubo (1991). The processes that lead to these earthquakes and volcanoes are ultimately dependent on the thermal structure of subduction zones - that is how hot it is at great depths. Metamorphic rocks exhumed from ancient subduction zones contain unique records of the temperatures that they witnessed as they traveled down a subduction zone before being exhumed. Geodynamic models and geophysical observations provide estimates of the thermal structures of present-day subduction zones. Interestingly, the rock record suggests significantly warmer conditions than those predicted for modern subduction zones. The proposed work will investigate the reasons for this discrepancy, which may lie in the way we interpret conditions from the rocks, the way they are exhumed, or even in how we compare model predictions and the rock record.<br/><br/>This proposal aims to address the rock-model discrepancy through two key questions: 1) Does our current interpretation of the rock record accurately represent the thermal structure of the associated ancient subduction zone? and 2) Did rocks get exhumed from ancient subduction zones that were hotter on average than modern subduction zones? To address Question 1 this team will determine P-T conditions for metamorphic rocks exhumed from five well-characterized localities that represent a range of thermal structures using relatively new analytical methods: trace element thermometers (e.g. Zr-in-rutile) and mineral inclusion barometers (e.g. quartz-in-garnet barometry). To address Question 2, they will develop geodynamical models of the ancient subduction zones represented by the exhumed rocks. These models will incorporate the effects of region-specific subduction dynamics, such as variations in slab age and subduction rate with time, subduction initiation, ridge subduction, and slab breakoff, when applicable. The model-predicted P-T conditions along the subduction interface will be compared with the newly produced P-T estimates to re-evaluate their disparity. The two-pronged approach of combining petrological observations and geodynamical modeling allows quantitative exploration of the thermal evolution of subduction zones. Subduction-related metamorphic rocks are the only direct samples of material from the plate interface; evaluating the P-T conditions using the latest thermobarometric approaches will provide the team with a more accurate and precise way to untangle the complex history they have experienced. Through geodynamical modeling, the effects of individual parameters on the thermal structure of subduction zones can be isolated, and this targeted approach will allow evaluation of possible explanations for the warm conditions that are recorded by exhumed rocks. The application of the two-pronged approach to the selected ancient subduction localities will allow researchers to determine whether the disparity can be reconciled. The results of this work have important implications for many processes, including geochemical cycling of volatiles, construction of continental crust, and the conditions that lead to arc volcanism. This work will engage graduate students and early career scientists in new collaborations between scientists of different disciplines (petrologists and geodynamicists) and at different institutions both in the US and abroad. EarthCache (TM) sites will be created in California (Franciscan and Catalina) as part of the project. These sites will engage the public in geoscience through the popular activity of geocaching and will disseminate information about subduction zone geology through information tied to direct observations of geologic features exhumed from subduction zones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the processes that govern evolution of monogenetic volcanoes, and the time scales over which these processes operate, is critical for hazard and risk assessment in active monogenetic volcanic fields. In particular, it is important to understand whether magmas ascend rapidly from the mantle to the surface, or instead undergo prolonged residence in the shallow crust, as this will influence the nature and timing of potential eruptive precursors that might be monitored, including seismicity, ground deformation, hydrologic changes, or gas emission. This project will provide key constraints on the sources, processes, and time scales of magma ascent and storage leading to eruption of monogenetic volcanoes in the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt - the largest monogenetic volcanic field in the world - and will provide an important framework for better understanding the behavior of monogenetic volcanic fields globally. The project will support the thesis work of a female graduate student in a STEM field where females are underrepresented. Two female high school students will be recruited to participate via internships. A colleague of Mexican heritage is co-PI an will work directly mentoring students.<br/><br/>This project will investigate recent, individual monogenetic cones and cone clusters linked closely in space and time, to address the processes and timescales governing magma evolution and temporal-compositional variations in the Michoac?n-Guanajuato Volcanic Field (MGVF) in the central Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt. Primary objectives of the project include assessing the relative importance of mantle versus crustal control on magmatism producing MGVF monogenetic clusters, and evaluating the similarities and differences that lead to formation of successive individual cinder cones versus small shield volcanoes. Specific questions include: 1) are multiple magma sources tapped in single eruptions?; 2) are the same magmas tapped in successive eruptions?; 3) are magmas stored at crustal levels, and if so, for how long?; 4) do different clusters exhibit common compositional progressions?; and 5) how do the processes and timescales of small shield volcano evolution compare to those of cinder cones? Target study areas include Late Pleistocene and Holocene cinder cone clusters in the Tac?mbaro, Tanc?taro and Zacapu areas, and the Holocene El Metate small shield volcano, all of which have recently been mapped in detail and dated. These questions will be addressed through geochemical and isotopic analysis at the mineral and whole-rock scales. The project will support the research of a female graduate student and several undergraduate students, including collaboration with a minority-recruiting organization on campus.

Because the multi-body motion planning problem involves computing collision-free trajectories for a large number of physical bodies, it is a highly challenging to solve with good optimality guarantees. This CAREER project will carry out a multi-thrust study on multi-body motion planning with the goal to push the state-of-the-art in the area through the development of fundamental theories, effective algorithms, and prototype hardware-software systems. From a practical point of view, the advances brought forward by this project will help enable a wide range of real-world applications including material handling (e.g., autonomous multi-robot systems at warehouses and shipping ports), entertainment (e.g., choreography with aerial vehicle swarms), digital biology (e.g., microfluidics chips), to list a few.  <br/><br/>The optimal motion coordination of many labeled physical bodies in a bounded 2D/3D environment, even under the relatively simple discrete setting, is known to be computationally hard. Until very recently, the best polynomial-time algorithm for labeled multi-body motion planning only guarantees time optimality that is quadratic with respect to the size of input problem, which is highly sub-optimal. This is far from ideal because it suggests that algorithms that compute optimal or near-optimal multi-body motion plans could potentially require super-polynomial running time. This CAREER project intends to bridge this long-standing gap that divides solution optimality and computational efficiency in multi-body motion planning. That is, could we construct algorithms that not only compute highly optimal solutions but also run in guaranteed low polynomial time? Our initial efforts over the past few years indicate that this could indeed be possible through a novel composition of algorithmic techniques including divide-and-conquer, regular bipartite perfect matching, and network flow, among others. Exploiting these techniques and our insights to their full potential, the project will develop theories, methods, and systems that will shatter the optimality-efficiency barrier in multi-body motion planning. The proposed research could bring foundational advances to robotics and intelligent systems research, including (1) a thorough structural analysis of discrete and continuous multi-body motion planning problems, leading to a solid understanding of key factors that affect the achievable optimality lower bounds, and (2) the development of state-of-the-art, practical algorithmic solutions with simultaneous optimality and computational efficiency guarantees, pushing the limits on the achievable optimality upper bounds. At the same time, the significant system development effort of the project, which involves the adaptation of algorithms to hardware subject to physical constraints and uncertainty, will help expose and resolve issues keen to real-world applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to increase the recruitment, retention, academic success, and graduation rates of these students  who begin their academic path at community colleges and transfer into engineering and computing degree programs at four-year institutions.Over a five-year period, this project will provide scholarships to 316 transfer students to pursue bachelor's degrees in engineering or computing. A national challenge in STEM education is the low graduation rate of engineering students who transfer from community colleges to four-year institutions. One driver of this low success rate is the insufficient preparation of community college students for the cultural differences they will face at the four-year institution. In addition, the four-year institution often lacks social and academic support to help bridge this gap.  The project components include: 1) a scholarship program to financially support low-income, high-achieving transfer students; 2) an evidence-based mentorship and cohort building program that supports transfer success; and 3) a Ph.D. student traineeship program that includes training in teaching, mentoring, and education research. It is expected that the program will contribute to the quality and diversity of the national STEM workforce and increase understanding of what works to support success of transfer students.<br/><br/>In addition to providing scholarships to low-income, academically high-achieving transfer students, this project addresses the well-known hurdles for transfer students by implementing and assessing a cohort mentoring model based on evidence-based strategies including communities of practice and cognitive mentorship.  The program elements are designed to support transfer student enculturation in the university, as well as degree completion and placement in the industrial workforce.  The program will recruit and train ten Clemson STEM PhD students for careers in academia by engaging them in immersive experiences in teaching, mentoring, and applied educational research. This training will include a residency at the community college sites where they will: 1) co-teach engineering courses with community college faculty; 2) develop and lead a cohort of low-income community college students in a project-based Creative Inquiry course that will be a focus of applied educational research; and 3) return to Clemson with the developed cohort, thus helping to bridge the institutional gap.  The program will conduct rigorous internal and external educational assessment and program evaluation to identify key indicators of student success and to provide information that can be used to improve STEM education at other institutions. Results from this work will be broadly disseminated through digital outlets (e.g., e-newsletters; listservs), presentations at national conferences, and publications in peer-reviewed and trade journals to reach audiences ranging from higher education to low-income students with aspirations of excellence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While much is known about the biological processes largely responsible for the transfer of carbon into the deep sea, very little is known about the microbial decay and subsequent remineralization processes that occur when the carbon reaches the deep sea.  Using newly-designed deep-sea incubators deployed off the east coast of the United States, researchers will explore the microbial communities and remineralization processes that transform carbon in the deep sea. The incubators will be filled with tracer-labeled algae or fecal material mimicking the diet and waste products of animal plankton. The tracers allow the researchers to follow the material through the microbial food web, and simultaneously determine the net release of carbon dioxide during the incubations. Using a combination of genetic analysis and novel analytical techniques, the researchers will be able to identify the organisms involved in the decay processes and rates at which changes occur at the single-cell level. Results will shed light on these understudied biological phenomena and contribute to an improved understanding of the global carbon cycle. In addition to novel advancements in oceanographic technology, the research supports graduate and undergraduate student education, and public outreach through partnerships with the Virginia Aquarium and National Ocean Sciences Bowl to increase ocean science literacy. <br/><br/>In this project, researchers will study the organisms, mechanisms, and physical and ecological factors that modulate the remineralization of organic material in the deep sea. The methods include using in situ incubations of well-defined and stable isotope-labeled sources of organic carbon (live and dead phytoplankton and fecal pellets of zooplankton) with natural microbial communities. The incubations will take place northeast of Cape Hatteras, a region characterized by strong offshore transport of phytoplankton carbon. Net carbon dioxide release rates will be measured over time by conversion of Carbon-13 labeled organic carbon to 13CO2 . The dependence of degradation rates on the source material, seasonality, oxygen concentration, and the type of microbial colonizers will be assessed. Parallel laboratory experiments will elucidate the exact shape of the time course of carbon release by phytoplankton into dissolved organic and inorganic fractions as well as determine how representative laboratory and ship-board generated values are relative to those obtained in situ. Target eukaryotic and prokaryotic taxa are identified by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) after the incubations and individually interrogated using Raman microspectrometry to investigate the relative Carbon-13-enrichment rates in organisms assimilating labeled detrital carbon. This multi-faceted approach will provide better constrained parameters for ecosystem and biological pump models and shed light on carbon balances of the deep sea.

Understanding how such things control metal solubility, particularly for Cu, is important for a number of reasons. It helps researchers understand potential driving mechanisms for core formation in terrestrial planets, or the conditions that lead to the formation of economically important metallogenic ore deposits. It's also key to understanding how volcanic degassing may impact metal emissions to the atmosphere. This study proposes to use synchrotron-based X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy of natural and synthetic magmatic glasses with the goal of providing the first direct, experimental constraints on the speciation of Cu in terrestrial melts. XAFS is currently the only methodology available for directly measuring Cu speciation in magmatic glasses at natural concentrations with high spatial resolution. In addition to the scientific goal of constraining which Cu species exist in melts, this work will broaden the participation of minority students in geoscience, and train students in state-of-the-art experimental and analytical techniques.<br/><br/>This will be achieved through three overlapping projects. Project 1 will include copper speciation measurements of synthetic basaltic glasses that are produced at controlled sulfur and oxygen conditions. This suite of synthetic glasses will have both oxygen and sulfur fugacity carefully controlled and will then be analyzed for changes in Cu speciation using XAFS. Project 2 includes Cu speciation measurements of natural glasses sampled from volcanic systems. This project targets natural samples from a sulfide-dominated system with H2O-poor melts (using samples collected from the Kilauea summit vent between 2008 and present), samples from a sulfide-dominated system with higher-H2O melts (from a basaltic cinder cone in the southern Cascade Range), and from sulfate dominated volcanics from both the southern Cascades Range and the Colima Graben in western Mexico. Project 3 will focus on developing advanced, synchrotron-based spectroscopic techniques for Cu K-edge XAFS of magmatic glasses, which will be applied to samples available from Projects 1 and 2, with a focus on developing High Energy-Resolution Fluorescence Detected XAFS (HERFD-XAFS) techniques for the analysis of Cu in geologic materials and magmatic glasses specifically. Such new HERFD-XAFS techniques hold the promise of providing superior spectroscopic sensitivity and resolution compared to conventional XAFS methods for uniquely constraining the copper ligands are present in these samples. These proposed measurements will be the first application of these methods to magmatic glasses and will establish a new database of spectroscopic measurements that will be available to the petrology community. Together, this suite of studies will significantly contribute to our understanding of metal solubility and transport in magmatic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In line with ongoing national efforts to train and diversify the workforce in science, this award supports students in the United States to attend the annual Conference on Principles of Advanced Discrete Simulation held in Chicago in June, 2019, with special emphasis on members of under-represented groups such as female and minorities. This serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission, to promote the progress of science as it provides a forum to disseminate research efforts, connect researchers, and train the next generation of scholars.<br/><br/>Selected students have access to traditional opportunities to support their career success and gain tools that support the advancement of science in theoretical as well as applied research on discrete simulations. Such traditional opportunities include presenting their work at the event (through oral presentations as well as posters), developing their scientific networks, and acquiring new state-of-the-art methods. Although the conference builds on a rich history dating back to 1985, the innovative format of the 2019 edition goes beyond traditional opportunities offered to students. In particular, the conference actively supports workforce development and the advancement of science by organizing (i) panels on careers beyond a doctoral program, with contributors from national laboratories, liberal arts colleges, and research universities; and (ii) round tables with editors of several prominent journals in the field. The funding provided by NSF thus has a significant impact on the careers of the future generation of researchers in discrete simulation, while encouraging diversity in the field.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project's strategy will also harness the excitement surrounding robotics and computer science, and leverage it with the investigators' exceptional infrastructure for education innovation and outreach to provide new, inspirational educational experiences for students. Finally, the project outcomes can broadly impact a number of other areas that would benefit from the developed novel methodologies, including search and rescue, construction and maintenance, and remote imaging, where the environment is dynamic or changes upon repeated inspection.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to gain a fundamental understanding of the cognition and adaptation needs of an intelligence-driven patient care approach to reduce medical errors. Realizing such an intelligent physical system would allow for augmenting physician capabilities. If one considers an operating room of the future, one can imagine scenarios where data is collected from, and shared with, all medical personnel including the surgeon, the supporting medical technicians, and anesthesiologists. In addition, artificial intelligence could be harnessed to look for unseen patterns in patient care. This operating room of the future will only be possible by establishing a new paradigm that includes medical devices with embedded smart and autonomous features. Such an intelligent physical system would gather knowledge from support personnel, sensors and diagnostics, and interpret physician intent and provide suggestions and diagnostic feedback in real-time. To provide real-world evaluation of this approach, the project will focus on robotic capsule endoscopy, with an intent to have immediate impact in conventional gastroenterology procedures. In pursuit of this goal, this project addresses three research objectives: the first objective focuses on robotic capsule endoscopy perception and control; the second objective formulates the perception and diagnostic support requirements to augment physician performance; and the third objective integrates multimodal, multi-label, temporal data analytics for intelligent physician support.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key challenge here is dealing with the low-level details of sensing and perception, while also reasoning at a high-level about the task to be completed. This project aims to develop a framework that allows robots to learn how to manipulate objects, how to usefully represent those objects abstractly, and how to generalize across objects that appear different but have the same functionality (e.g., different microwaves). This project will develop new algorithms that will enable robots to reason and plan in complex scenarios in the real world; it could therefore substantially accelerate the deployment of complex robots in semi-structured environments like the home, hospitals, light manufacturing facilities, and space. <br/><br/>This project aims to enable robots to autonomously learn reusable object-centric motor skills and the portable symbolic representations that support planning with those skills.  Learning motor skills to manipulate, and abstract representations to reason about, objects in the world---while generalizing across objects of similar functionality---will enable robots to generate intelligent, goal-directed mobile manipulation behavior. The project will 1) design practical algorithms that discover motor skills for manipulating objects by interacting with them, 2) design algorithms for generalizing those skills across objects with different appearances but similar functionality, and 3) develop a theoretically sound framework for learning object-centric abstract representations that support goal-directed planning using those skills, and demonstrate its use on a mobile manipulation robot.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to increase the recruitment, retention, academic success, and graduation rates of these students  who begin their academic path at community colleges and transfer into engineering and computing degree programs at four-year institutions.Over a five-year period, this project will provide scholarships to 316 transfer students to pursue bachelor's degrees in engineering or computing. A national challenge in STEM education is the low graduation rate of engineering students who transfer from community colleges to four-year institutions. One driver of this low success rate is the insufficient preparation of community college students for the cultural differences they will face at the four-year institution. In addition, the four-year institution often lacks social and academic support to help bridge this gap.  The project components include: 1) a scholarship program to financially support low-income, high-achieving transfer students; 2) an evidence-based mentorship and cohort building program that supports transfer success; and 3) a Ph.D. student traineeship program that includes training in teaching, mentoring, and education research. It is expected that the program will contribute to the quality and diversity of the national STEM workforce and increase understanding of what works to support success of transfer students.<br/><br/>In addition to providing scholarships to low-income, academically high-achieving transfer students, this project addresses the well-known hurdles for transfer students by implementing and assessing a cohort mentoring model based on evidence-based strategies including communities of practice and cognitive mentorship.  The program elements are designed to support transfer student enculturation in the university, as well as degree completion and placement in the industrial workforce.  The program will recruit and train ten Clemson STEM PhD students for careers in academia by engaging them in immersive experiences in teaching, mentoring, and applied educational research. This training will include a residency at the community college sites where they will: 1) co-teach engineering courses with community college faculty; 2) develop and lead a cohort of low-income community college students in a project-based Creative Inquiry course that will be a focus of applied educational research; and 3) return to Clemson with the developed cohort, thus helping to bridge the institutional gap.  The program will conduct rigorous internal and external educational assessment and program evaluation to identify key indicators of student success and to provide information that can be used to improve STEM education at other institutions. Results from this work will be broadly disseminated through digital outlets (e.g., e-newsletters; listservs), presentations at national conferences, and publications in peer-reviewed and trade journals to reach audiences ranging from higher education to low-income students with aspirations of excellence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, the ocean's long timescales and diverse regional circulations impose strong constraints on the patterns of surface and subsurface warming under greenhouse-gas forcing. In turn, oceans mediate the rate and magnitude of global warming through (i) storage of anomalous heat at depth and (ii) the coupling between surface warming patterns and atmospheric radiative feedbacks, which governs the evolution of global climate sensitivity. Insights into the role of oceans in climate have come from idealized coupled global climate model (GCM) experiments wherein different ocean circulations and climates are induced by prescribing distinct continental geometries. This project is to examine the role of large scale oceanic circulation in the earth's climate system in simplified geometries and with cloud feedbacks. Different idealized continental configurations will be considered. This work improves upon previous efforts that have used ocean-only models or coupled models that did not include cloud-feedbacks. This work would support a female graduate student, an assistant professor to advise the research, and a part-time software engineer to assist in technical aspects of computing and modeling. The graduate student would gain valuable experience in teaching and communicating climate science. The idealized nature of results from this project would make them valuable additions to undergraduate and graduate courses. Tools developed for the purposes of designing idealized continental (or bathymetric) geometries in the coupled model will be made widely available to the community through both GitHub and, eventually, within NCAR's Community Earth System Model (CESM) idealized ocean model hierarchy.<br/><br/>This project improves on previously idealized, coupled modeling framework in three key ways: (i) By employing state-of-the-art model components that, importantly, represent realistic cloud feedbacks which were previously neglected; (ii) By performing simulations with novel continental geometries and with varying planetary rotation rates; and (iii) By performing carbon dioxide forcing simulations with a range of background ocean circulation regimes induced by those distinct continental geometries. These model experiments are designed to answer key outstanding questions about the role of oceans in climate and climate change. The work will lead to improved understanding of the conditions by which large-scale ocean circulations arise and in turn govern: (i) large-scale asymmetries in climate; (ii) geographic patterns of climate change; and (iii) the rate and magnitude of global warming. In particular, it will provide deeper knowledge of the specific dynamics by which the oceans and atmosphere affect pole-to-equator temperature gradients; meridional heat transport and its partitioning between oceans and atmosphere; freshwater transport; tropical rainfall patterns; and localization of deep-water formation and meridional overturning. The work could also provide a physical theory for why GCMs predict increasing climate sensitivity under greenhouse-gas forcing, thus improving our understanding of one of the major uncertainties in climate projection. Evaluating the key role of clouds and cloud feedbacks in contributing to these features will be a focus throughout.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This process is associated with a large array of geological hazards such as magnitude 9 megathrust earthquakes and explosive arc volcanism. Today, millions of people live in areas that are potentially exposed to subduction zone hazards, including large regions of Cascadia and Alaska. However, the mechanisms by which water-rich rocks are transferred from the down-going plate (slab) into the Earth's interior, and the consequences of this transfer process on geological hazards, remain largely unknown. The best rock samples to study material transfer in subduction zones are unique rocks called melanges ('mixed' rocks) that come from the top of the slab. Although largely overlooked in most subduction zone models, these rocks may play a significant role in the generation of arc lavas, and strongly influence the geodynamics of subduction zones. This project will combine high-pressure, high-temperature laboratory experiments on melange materials with numerical modeling to quantify this transfer process in the Earth's interior. This transformative and interdisciplinary approach will provide novel constraints on the role of melanges in the development of subduction zone hazards, as well as training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate, and K-12 students.<br/><br/>Conventional models of subduction zones predict that trace element fractionations observed in arc magmas occur during two distinct events: (a) dehydration and release of fluids from altered oceanic crust, and (b) partial melting of sediments at the slab-mantle interface. However, no previous experimental studies have reproduced the chemistry of arc magmas by simulating this conventional model. By contrast, other studies argue that fluids, sediments, and serpentinized wedge mix together at the slab-mantle interface to form melanges, which are hybrid rocks composed of blocks of altered oceanic crust and sediments, mixed with serpentinized peridotite. As the slab descends, melanges formed at the top of the slab may partially melt and produce trace element fractionation typical of arc magmas directly at the slab-mantle interface. Alternatively, melanges may rise from the slab-mantle interface as solid diapirs and partially melt during their ascent, delaying the onset of trace element fractionation. In both scenarios, melange melts would react with the peridotite mantle wedge on their way to the surface, combining their chemical characteristics with that of the mantle. This project will combine a series of high-pressure, high-temperature experiments with numerical modeling to investigate the chemical and physical behavior of natural melange rocks in subduction zones. The combined experimental and modeling results will provide a transformative approach to assess the role of melanges in subduction zone magmatism.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The accumulation of magma reservoirs in the continental crust is a fundamental process that is responsible for the growth of the crust, the segregation of economically valuable ore deposits, and the generation of volcanic eruptions. Dating and compositional measurements of the mineral zircon are commonly employed to reconstruct the history of magma reservoir growth in the geologic record. Numerical models of magma emplacement and thermo-chemical evolution have promoted an increasingly sophisticated understanding of the processes by which magma is accumulated and stored. However, uniting the zircon and modeling perspectives is subject to the fundamental difficulty of relating chemical analyses made at the crystal-scale of nano and/or micro meters to processes at the magma reservoir scale of meters to tens of kilometers. Thus, these methods are poorly integrated. The objective of this project is to develop a numerical modeling framework that couples the growth rate of zircon crystals to the physical, chemical and thermal evolution of the host magma. This modeling approach will also serve as a basis for videos and animations illustrating magma reservoir processes that will be used to communicate the results of this research to the general public and for the production of publicly available materials for K-12 and undergraduate earth science education.  <br/>	 <br/>The ubiquity of zircon in the crust and its physical and chemical robustness make it an indispensable tracer of magma reservoir longevity and chemical evolution. Yet, these characteristics also contribute to ambiguous geologic interpretations of the geologic record. While advances in the analysis of zircon over the last two decades have resulted in dramatic improvements in analytical precision and spatial resolution, these new capabilities have revealed previously unappreciated complexities in the zircon record that drive contemporary petrologic controversies. This project will integrate a magma dynamics model --including multi-phase flow, phase equilibrium, and heat flow -- with a model of Zr-diffusion-limited zircon growth that also incorporates a range of trace element partitioning behavior and the development of enriched boundary layers. This framework will address three principal and interrelated questions surrounding the interpretation of zircon data: i) How does the trade-off between the spatial resolution and analytical precision of the zircon date affect its interpretation? Particularly, do dates produced for whole crystals lead to the same conclusions as those produced by in situ techniques? How well do either capture the evolution of the host magma system?; ii) What criteria are most effective at distinguishing inherited zircons from those crystallized in situ?; iii) How do -micrometer to sub-micrometer - scale variations in zircon chemistry relate to the host melt evolution? Initial models will comprise a single magma reservoir in the crust. Guided by the results of these simulations, greater complexity will be implemented through the tracking of individual zircon crystals that move within the magma reservoir, the development of interconnected reservoirs that comprise a trans-crustal magma system, and calibrated simulations designed to reproduce well-studied natural systems. This approach will yield new insights into the timescales and conditions of magma storage, the relationship between voluminous ignimbrites and plutons, and the scaling of volcanic eruptions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The results of the research project will provide researchers with tools to improve empirical economic research and therefore provide policy makers with more accurate policy inputs.  The research project therefore advances national economic prosperity by providing better and more reliable tools for evidence-based economic policy analysis in many areas such as antitrust enforcement.  The research project also provides pedagogical advances that better integrate economics into a broader STEM education on data science, computer science, and applied mathematics.  The results of this project will also establish the U.S. as the global leader in developing better tools for economic analyses.<br/><br/>Identification is a critical concept in empirical economics and many other fields.  It exhibits an inherent tradeoff: Stronger conclusions require stronger assumptions, but stronger assumptions may lead to wrong conclusions.  Empirical researchers differ in their preferences for resolving this tradeoff.  The goal of the proposed research is to widen the choice of available methodology in a way that gives researchers more flexibility in exploring the assumptions-conclusions frontier.  The proposed research will achieve this goal by casting the identification problem as an optimization problem.  This transforms the abstract question of identification into the concrete mathematical operation of maximizing a function subject to constraints.  This enables the application of computational and theoretical tools from applied mathematics and operations research.  The proposed research will apply this identification-as-optimizations link to three different empirical problems: (1) nonparametric discrete choice modeling; (2) sensitivity analysis in dynamic programming models; and (3) extrapolation in instrumental variable and regression discontinuity designs.

The planned rate of addition is 2-3 orders of magnitude higher than current levels of reactive phosphorus (P) in DW and urban streams.

They are the location of many societally-relevant hazards, including the generation of Earth's deadliest earthquakes, such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and associated tsunami, and volcanic eruptions such as those at Mt St Helens (1980) and Mt Pinatubo (1991). The processes that lead to these earthquakes and volcanoes are ultimately dependent on the thermal structure of subduction zones - that is how hot it is at great depths. Metamorphic rocks exhumed from ancient subduction zones contain unique records of the temperatures that they witnessed as they traveled down a subduction zone before being exhumed. Geodynamic models and geophysical observations provide estimates of the thermal structures of present-day subduction zones. Interestingly, the rock record suggests significantly warmer conditions than those predicted for modern subduction zones. The proposed work will investigate the reasons for this discrepancy, which may lie in the way we interpret conditions from the rocks, the way they are exhumed, or even in how we compare model predictions and the rock record.<br/><br/>This proposal aims to address the rock-model discrepancy through two key questions: 1) Does our current interpretation of the rock record accurately represent the thermal structure of the associated ancient subduction zone? and 2) Did rocks get exhumed from ancient subduction zones that were hotter on average than modern subduction zones? To address Question 1 this team will determine P-T conditions for metamorphic rocks exhumed from five well-characterized localities that represent a range of thermal structures using relatively new analytical methods: trace element thermometers (e.g. Zr-in-rutile) and mineral inclusion barometers (e.g. quartz-in-garnet barometry). To address Question 2, they will develop geodynamical models of the ancient subduction zones represented by the exhumed rocks. These models will incorporate the effects of region-specific subduction dynamics, such as variations in slab age and subduction rate with time, subduction initiation, ridge subduction, and slab breakoff, when applicable. The model-predicted P-T conditions along the subduction interface will be compared with the newly produced P-T estimates to re-evaluate their disparity. The two-pronged approach of combining petrological observations and geodynamical modeling allows quantitative exploration of the thermal evolution of subduction zones. Subduction-related metamorphic rocks are the only direct samples of material from the plate interface; evaluating the P-T conditions using the latest thermobarometric approaches will provide the team with a more accurate and precise way to untangle the complex history they have experienced. Through geodynamical modeling, the effects of individual parameters on the thermal structure of subduction zones can be isolated, and this targeted approach will allow evaluation of possible explanations for the warm conditions that are recorded by exhumed rocks. The application of the two-pronged approach to the selected ancient subduction localities will allow researchers to determine whether the disparity can be reconciled. The results of this work have important implications for many processes, including geochemical cycling of volatiles, construction of continental crust, and the conditions that lead to arc volcanism. This work will engage graduate students and early career scientists in new collaborations between scientists of different disciplines (petrologists and geodynamicists) and at different institutions both in the US and abroad. EarthCache (TM) sites will be created in California (Franciscan and Catalina) as part of the project. These sites will engage the public in geoscience through the popular activity of geocaching and will disseminate information about subduction zone geology through information tied to direct observations of geologic features exhumed from subduction zones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In most cases, this can be accomplished by genetic manipulations that result in reduced protein expression or protein inactivation. This strategy, however, is not feasible when the loss of such proteins is lethal to the organism. Moreover, some cellular pathways are very dynamic, and the effect of protein inactivation may be detectable only within short time frames. This project will develop an on-demand system to target specific proteins for degradation in plants and will allow plant biologists to determine the effect of removing such proteins from the cell within a short time. This protein degradation system is applicable to any plant pathway and therefore will become a transformative tool for plant biology. This work will train two undergraduates and a postdoctoral research associate in state-of-the-art techniques in molecular biology, live-cell imaging, communication and public engagement. The research will include outreach to underrepresented high-school students in hands-on research as part of NCSU's CAALS-3D program.<br/><br/>The goal of this exploratory EAGER project is to design, test and optimize the first plant-compatible inducible degron tool for inactivation of protein targets in plants. This system will also enable the characterization of essential proteins, for which the only genetic tool available today is dexamethasone-induced RNA silencing. RNA silencing requires days of incubation before changes in protein levels are detected, which makes it inadequate for dynamic cellular events. A fast, inducible system to control protein abundance in plants will be useful for studies of highly dynamic processes such as endomembrane trafficking and cell cycle control. The proposed degron is based on the specific interaction between a heterologous E3 enzyme and its target protein. A fusion of the target protein with a protein of interest will be co-expressed with the E3 enzyme fused to an inducible domain. This design will result in an inducible system for on-demand degradation of proteins of interest in plants. The aims of this project are: 1) To develop the first plant inducible protein degron; and 2) To demonstrate degron functionality by targeting two essential proteins. GoldenBraid cloning and genetic transformation into Nicotiana and Arabidopsis will be used to test the feasibility, efficiency and speed of the degron. Quantitative imaging of GFP and two endogenous essential proteins will be used as test cases for proof of concept. The induced degradation of targeted protein is expected to occur rapidly, within 30 min, which will allow plant biologists to query any pathway of interest with unmatched time resolution using stably transformed plants. This system will facilitate analyses of a wide variety of cellular processes that are controlled by essential proteins and will improve temporal resolution in protein knockdown experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, there is considerable disagreement on how grasslands will respond to environmental change, and the potentially dramatic changes to crop productivity, species invasions, and biodiversity remain unknown. Without a firm understanding of the climatic conditions that caused the spreading of warm-season grasses in the deep past, it is difficult to predict how they will respond in the future. The significant enlargement of grasses' geographic range millions of years ago during the Miocene is the focus of this study. This project is the first to collect data on precipitation and vegetation during the Miocene in South America and to use it to make simulations of ancient climate during this important ecological change. Results are leading to new understanding about how the abundance of warm-season grasses may change in natural and managed landscapes in response to future environmental changes.<br/><br/>The Late Miocene expansion of C4 grasses is one of the most dramatic ecological changes in the past 65 million years. In order to predict how these economically important grasses will respond to future enviornmental change, the factors controlling their past distributions must be understood. In South America, C4 grass expansion was coincident with a strengthening of the South American Summer Monsoon and regional tectonic changes. This project is combining multi-proxy paleovegetation reconstructions with proxy-based paleoclimatic reconstructions and paleoclimatic modeling techniques to understand the linkages between tectonics, climate, and environmental change in South America. Results are leading to new understanding of the conditions under which C4 grasses expanded.

While this technology is potentially ground breaking for society broadly, self-driving vehicles may prove especially beneficial for those who are blind or who cannot otherwise operate conventional motor vehicles due to their disability. Despite the tremendous promise of self-driving technology in this regard, advocates of the many blind and visually impaired persons in the United States argue that the needs of visually impaired persons are not being adequately considered in the design of the technology, resulting in what may become accessibility barriers to its use. The PI seeks to address this issue through research that will explore the potential accessibility barriers encountered by visually impaired persons in their practical use of a self-driving vehicle, and through fundamental research that will derive solutions to these problems.  <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to produce a model of interaction that will support the use of self-driving vehicle technology by visually impaired persons.

IRES participants will be immersed in producing and understanding solar analytics and creating algorithms and software to control solar arrays. The IRES program will engage faculty researchers from the Arizona State University SenSIP center and from the University of Cyprus KIOS Center in solar energy research.

This international research endeavor will energize students to innovate and disseminate results globally. <br/><br/> Solar energy or photovoltaic (PV) arrays encounter loss of efficiency under conditions of shading, panel faults and temperature variations.  In fact, shading, weather patterns, soiling, and temperature reduce power output considerably. For example, a malfunction of one panel will cause an entire PV string to fail.  To minimize inefficiencies, individual panel current-voltage (I-V) measurements, weather information, and imaging data are essential. Controlling the power output is possible through solar panel matrix switching and optimization (i.e., changing certain array connections from series to parallel using actuators). Matrix switching using programmable relays allows for different interconnection options. The research goal is to optimize PV array systems by: a) exploiting the measured I-V patterns to detect faults using machine learning, b) employing advanced imaging and vision techniques to predict shading, c)  using temperature, irradiance  and weather data to elevate PV efficiency, and d) include smart grid interfaces.  This collaborative IRES project between Arizona State University and University of Cyprus will engage students in the following research problems: a) How do we use imaging to detect cloud movement, predict shading and elevate efficiency? b) How can the array connections be reconfigured based on imaging, weather, and I-V data to elevate efficiency? c) How can we detect and classify panel faults in real time using machine learning and other algorithms? d) How do we extend these solar monitoring and control concepts from utility-scale solar farms to house rooftop systems?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, processes of conducting volunteer flood rescues, factors that affect immediate decision-making during rescues, decisions about volunteer group development, and use of social media for rescuing and group development will be researched through intense interviewing and participation with rescuers. Disasters are unique opportunities to study social processes, and they are also becoming more frequent social problems.  Disasters of recent years have introduced volunteer organizations supported by social media and new technologies. Limited scholarly research has studied this volunteer rescue movement, these volunteers, or these rescue operations. Findings will contribute to scholarly understanding of group formation and development and how this may be affected by new technologies.  They also will contribute to public welfare by being integrated in courses such as on emergency management and hazard mitigation and recovery, and by being directly shared with organizations that do rescues as well as the broader emergency management and public communities.<br/><br/>To address the research goal, ethnographic research will be conducted that includes participation with volunteer organizations that conduct rescues, 20-40 interviews with emergency management officials, 30-60 interviews with volunteer rescuers, and 20-30 interviews with persons rescued by civilian volunteers. Over the life of the project, this will involve training and traveling with volunteer organizations as they respond to disasters, such as the three to which these organizations responded in 2018, Hurricanes Florence and Michael and floods in Southeast Texas.  Participation will be in three different roles: boat rescuer, dispatcher, and leadership coordination. In addition, available social media data and media articles will be collected and analyzed inductively.

The investment in this equipment enhances the analytical capabilities of a stable isotope facility that is used by a large community of US scientists and will facilitate a broad range of experiments for decades. Isotopes of carbon in fossil shells are useful as a chemical fingerprint of how carbon moves between various forms such as carbon dioxide in the atmosphere, dissolved carbon in the ocean, and as carbon incorporated into organic materials formed by plants and animals. Isotopes of oxygen are typically used to trace changes in physical environments, such as past temperature changes, and movement of water through evaporation, rain, or snow, growth or melting of glaciers, and freshwater flows into the ocean. This is important for fundamental understanding of the natural interactions between climate and life on earth, and provides scientific background for policy interests of the United States related to changes in natural environments. The equipment supports education and training of students, including experiential learning in STEM fields. <br/><br/>The Kiel-IV high-vacuum acid-digestion device acquired through this project is enabling new research directions and improves the analytical capabilities of the Oregon State University/College of Earth, Ocean, and Atmospheric Sciences Stable Isotope Laboratory for measuring oxygen and carbon isotopes in ultra-small samples of carbonate (such as fossil foraminifera and other biogenic carbonates). The instrument is attached as an inlet system to an existing ThermoFisher 253Plus isotope-ratio mass spectrometer. This new equipment serves a large community of NSF-funded investigators, so will facilitate many projects. Primary applications are in paleoclimatology and paleoceanography. The equipment is also used in STEM experiential learning for students at the undergraduate and graduate levels.

While modern anthropological and sociological research is increasingly oriented toward the transnational nature of cultures and languages, other disciplines, like linguistics, may lag in comparison. Moreover, because many displaced people are speakers of minority languages, the pressure to shift to more politically and culturally advantageous languages threatens the transmission of minority languages to future generations. As a result, linguists are increasingly finding themselves conducting time sensitive work with speakers of understudied languages in diaspora communities. This award will convene a symposium to address this gap in linguistics, bringing the field into a fuller dialogue with other social sciences, as well as emerging research on transnational networks and their relevance to the economic, medical, and legal problems of the modern world. The broader impacts of the symposium include enabling community language experts who are personally affected by the threat of linguistic and cultural attrition in diaspora environments to connect with others in similar situations in order to develop mutually beneficial solutions, as well as to prepare a set best practices for linguistic research in diaspora contexts that incorporates perspectives from migration studies and can be disseminated to enhance the training of those involved in linguistic research with diaspora communities.<br/> <br/>The symposium will bring together linguists working with threatened languages spoken in diasporic contexts in both urban and rural communities around the United States of America to interact with specialists in different areas of migration studies, including political conflict, refugee studies, and urbanization. Best practices in the social sciences must adapt to the changing social and political circumstances in our world, in particular the worldwide flows of immigrants and refugees.  Yet many of the widely accepted best practices in linguistic research fail to take the sociopolitical situation of speakers into account and start from assumptions about language communities that are inapplicable to languages spoken in diasporic contexts. Working in diasporic contexts also raises questions beyond the scope of traditional training. These questions pertain to how a language community is defined; how to work with communities in conflict; and how language change takes place in hyperdiverse contexts. Symposium participants will write a consensus-based white paper proposing best practices for linguistic research in diaspora contexts and promulgate this text for wider scholarly discussion among linguists and other researchers with overlapping specializations. Such a collaborative effort has the potential to increase the efficacy of future work on languages spoken in diaspora communities. Project activities will be valuable to scholars already working in diaspora contexts and will offer foundational training to both undergraduate and graduate students in anthropological, descriptive, documentary, and theoretical linguistics programs. Activities also have the potential to enhance multidisciplinary research beyond linguistics with the involvement of other social scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is framed around the concept of biological normalcy, which refers to the ways in which human societies develop understandings of what a ""normal"" human body is - normal referring to normative ideas about what bodies ""should"" be as well as statistical distributions of different phenotypic traits. The researchers use this concept to address: 1) how cultural beliefs about what constitutes a ""normal"" or healthy body are related to statistical biological norms (i.e. obesity prevalence) within a population, and 2) how these normative beliefs influence the statistical distribution of biological traits (i.e. allostatic load) in a population. It is hypothesized that variation in obesity prevalence observed between the two field sites in Indiana will be associated with differences in perceived weight stigma, with those reporting higher perceived stigma also having higher allostatic load, and that this relationship will be moderated by several social and behavioral factors and coping strategies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As our communication methods have evolved, we are naturally led to deep mathematical problems which must be solved before we can make further progress. Some of these problems are also deeply connected to central questions in complexity theory and new advances in optimization.<br/><br/>The investigators will focus on advanced techniques toward tackling central problems in circuit complexity and pseudo-randomness. In particular, they will apply recent advances in arithmetic geometry to the construction of new pseudo-random generators and new complexity lower bounds. One technique the investigators will pursue is their recent discovery of an efficient method to count solutions of polynomial equations over finite rings. This technique will help analyze a new family of pseudo-random generators with potentially better unpredictability than earlier constructions based on discrete logarithms and factoring. The research team will also use techniques from real and p-adic geometry to study the number of integer solutions to structured polynomials. The latter problem is one of the few recent methods with the potential to yield new lower bounds for circuit complexity and a better understanding of the P vs. NP question.

Given the severity and urgency of this threat it is critical to investigate mechanisms by which some corals might survive warming, assess the degree to which this is happening on reefs, and apply these discoveries to inform conservation interventions that might improve survival trajectories wherever possible. This project aims to fulfill these objectives by testing whether reef corals in the Caribbean are undergoing shifts in their algal symbionts in favor of more heat-tolerant types, what the consequences of these shifts might be for coral reef ecosystems, and the way in which we might use this information to help conserve them. Scientific objectives will be leveraged to improve the effectiveness of reef restoration efforts in the Caribbean by applying findings to ongoing intervention trials which aim to seed outplanted corals (both adult fragments raised in nurseries, and sexually derived coral recruits) with heat tolerant algae that are climate-resistant. It also takes advantage of emerging opportunities at two major public aquariums to highlight the plight of coral reefs to engaged public audiences primed to receive this message and learn about the role of science in both understanding and mitigating the problem. Finally, numerous high school, undergraduate, and graduate students will receive mentorship during this project, helping to train the next generation of marine scientists. <br/><br/>This project tests whether continued climate warming is causing heat-tolerant algal symbionts (such as Durusdinium trenchii) to become increasingly common on coral reefs in the Caribbean. Understanding the changing symbiotic ""milieu"" in the region, the processes underlying the spread of D. trenchii, and the consequences of this spread, are very timely questions that have the potential to help us understand future reef states. This project will: (1) Manipulate coral symbioses in the laboratory, including a number of Caribbean coral species never before attempted, to assess in a standardized way their relative ability to acquire heat-tolerant symbionts; (2) Outplant corals with manipulated symbiont communities to reefs to assess real-world ecophysiological tradeoffs to heat tolerance, such as reduced growth rate; (3) Introduce heat-tolerant symbionts to coral colonies in the field using tissue implants in order to understand environmental controls on the persistence or loss of introduced symbionts; (4) Evaluate transgenerational feedbacks in the symbiotic milieu by investigating the roles of temperature and D. trenchii availability on the acquisition and establishment of these symbionts in newly settled coral larvae; and (5) Quantify changes in the incidence and relative abundance of heat-tolerant symbionts in the Caribbean over the last ~20 years using unique archived samples dating back to 1995-2002 from Florida, Bahamas, Belize, and Bermuda.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At convergent plate margins, a kilometer-thick lithospheric plate consisting of the Earth's crust and uppermost mantle is drawn - or subducted - beneath another lithospheric plate. At around 80-140 kilometers depth, the subducted plate releases volatile-rich material and 'recycles' it back to the Earth's surface via highly explosive, volatile-rich volcanism that forms chains of volcanoes aligned in arcs. On human time scales, eruptions of such single arc volcanoes have caused deadly climate perturbations (e.g. Tambora in 1815) and tsunamis (e.g. Krakatoa in 1883). Hence, understanding how arc volcanism is related to the material transfer from slab remains at the core of geoscience research. In such studies, the cosmogenic isotope 10Be, plays a pivotal role, because it is a unique, geochemical tracer that unambiguously identifies material recycled from slab material. In addition to the important scientific impact of this work, this work impacts society by fostering international collaboration between the U.S. and Mexico, and it also supports students at Columbia. Results from this project will also be incorporated into course curricula.<br/><br/>Recent analytical advances have much improved the detection limit of 10Be in arc volcanic rocks, now allowing for integrating critical volcanic rock series from convergent margins that could not be studied previously. In this project, the 10Be tracer will be further explored and tested through a study in the Transmexican Volcanic Belt (TMVB). The TMVB is a major convergent margin which is well-known for historic eruptions that produced an unusually broad spectrum of volcanic rocks in close temporal and spatial association. While previous geochemical studies showed that these volcanic rocks have direct bearing on the material recycling from slab, crucial details of material transfer (how? how much? how fast?) remain contested. A selected set of well-studied samples from the central (Popocatepetl volcano and surrounding) and western (Colima volcano and surrounding) TMVB will be analysed for 10Be in order to test current hypotheses of subduction recycling. Overall, the project will provide new constraints on the connectivity between slab subduction and arc volcanism and its role in regulating the longterm evolution and maintenance of habitable Earth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Marine cyanobacteria are one such key group of organisms, since they supply much of the essential carbon and nitrogen that supports nearly all the rest of the marine food web. Currently, the growth of cyanobacteria is mostly constrained by scarce supplies of the micronutrient element iron, but they are also very sensitive to the ongoing increases in seawater temperature. Preliminary results suggest that warming could partly mitigate the negative effects of iron limitation on marine cyanobacteria. This project examines in depth how these interactions between warming and iron limitation will affect the future ocean carbon and nitrogen cycles, using laboratory culture experiments showing how cyanobacteria respond to simultaneously changing temperature and iron supplies. Both short-term response studies and long-term evolutionary experiments testing for adaptation use a comprehensive set of molecular biology tools targeting genes to proteins. The final goal is to apply the results of these experiments to improve quantitative models predicting how the ocean's carbon and nitrogen cycles, biological productivity, and living resources will respond to a warming future climate. Two graduate students, a postdoc and 3-4 underrepresented undergraduate researchers are supported, and the investigators also mentor summer science interns from largely Hispanic local high schools. <br/><br/>The physiology, biochemistry and biogeography of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria and unicellular picocyanobacteria are strongly influenced by temperature, subjecting them to intense selective pressure as the modern ocean steadily warms up. These groups have likewise been rigorously selected under chronic iron (Fe) scarcity, and the availability of this crucial micronutrient is also changing with a shifting climate. This project examines short-term acclimation and long-term evolutionary responses of Fe-stressed marine cyanobacteria to a warmer environment. Preliminary data show that Iron Use Efficiencies (IUE, mols N fixed.hr-1 mol cellular Fe-1) of Fe-limited Trichodesmium increase 4 to 5-fold with a 5oC temperature increase, allowing the cells to much more efficiently leverage scarce available Fe supplies to grow and fix nitrogen. This means that warming can to a large degree mitigate the negative effects of Fe limitation on Trichodesmium, resulting in a modelled 22% increase in global nitrogen fixation by 2100 in a warmer climate. This project aims to uncover the cellular biochemical mechanisms involved in this Fe-limitation/thermal IUE effect in a four-year experimental evolution study of the diazotrophs Trichodesmium and Crocosphaera and the picocyanobacteria Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus, under a multi-variate selection matrix of temperature and Fe availability. The objectives are to 1) Assess the long-term adaptive responses of fitness, IUE and physiology to Fe limitation and warming interactions in these four major cyanobacterial groups; 2) Determine the molecular and biochemical mechanisms behind the surprising Fe/warming interactive effect on IUE using genomics, transcriptomics and quantitative proteomics coupled with 'metalloproteomics' determinations of Fe content in critical proteins; 3) Compare and contrast acclimation and adaptation responses to Fe limitation and warming in key cyanobacteria taxa, and 4) Integrate results using a published biogeochemical modeling approach to assess global consequences for marine productivity and nitrogen fixation.  This project offers a mechanistic and predictive understanding of adaptation to Fe and warming co-stressors in a rapidly changing future ocean environment for some of the most important photoautotrophic functional groups in the ocean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how such things control metal solubility, particularly for Cu, is important for a number of reasons. It helps researchers understand potential driving mechanisms for core formation in terrestrial planets, or the conditions that lead to the formation of economically important metallogenic ore deposits. It's also key to understanding how volcanic degassing may impact metal emissions to the atmosphere. This study proposes to use synchrotron-based X-ray absorption fine structure (XAFS) spectroscopy of natural and synthetic magmatic glasses with the goal of providing the first direct, experimental constraints on the speciation of Cu in terrestrial melts. XAFS is currently the only methodology available for directly measuring Cu speciation in magmatic glasses at natural concentrations with high spatial resolution. In addition to the scientific goal of constraining which Cu species exist in melts, this work will broaden the participation of minority students in geoscience, and train students in state-of-the-art experimental and analytical techniques.<br/><br/>This will be achieved through three overlapping projects. Project 1 will include copper speciation measurements of synthetic basaltic glasses that are produced at controlled sulfur and oxygen conditions. This suite of synthetic glasses will have both oxygen and sulfur fugacity carefully controlled and will then be analyzed for changes in Cu speciation using XAFS. Project 2 includes Cu speciation measurements of natural glasses sampled from volcanic systems. This project targets natural samples from a sulfide-dominated system with H2O-poor melts (using samples collected from the Kilauea summit vent between 2008 and present), samples from a sulfide-dominated system with higher-H2O melts (from a basaltic cinder cone in the southern Cascade Range), and from sulfate dominated volcanics from both the southern Cascades Range and the Colima Graben in western Mexico. Project 3 will focus on developing advanced, synchrotron-based spectroscopic techniques for Cu K-edge XAFS of magmatic glasses, which will be applied to samples available from Projects 1 and 2, with a focus on developing High Energy-Resolution Fluorescence Detected XAFS (HERFD-XAFS) techniques for the analysis of Cu in geologic materials and magmatic glasses specifically. Such new HERFD-XAFS techniques hold the promise of providing superior spectroscopic sensitivity and resolution compared to conventional XAFS methods for uniquely constraining the copper ligands are present in these samples. These proposed measurements will be the first application of these methods to magmatic glasses and will establish a new database of spectroscopic measurements that will be available to the petrology community. Together, this suite of studies will significantly contribute to our understanding of metal solubility and transport in magmatic systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The principle impetus of this research is to focus primarily on advanced diabetic patients who suffer from nerve damage to their feet. These patients cannot feel their feet, leading to two important and related results. First, they are at high risk for an increased number of undetected ulcerating injuries from tissue damage produced by walking (friction) or standing (pressure). Second, since these injuries are undetected and unfelt, there is a decreased urgency by the patient to seek medical care. Delays in medical intervention further exacerbate injuries and complicate treatment, leading to an economic burden associated with foot ulceration estimated at $15 billion annually. More importantly, the 5-year mortality rate after first ulceration (40%) approaches mortality rates from heart failure (50%). The key need for a simple and cost-effective ulcer-prevention paradigm is a safe, easy-to-use foot monitoring system with temperature-sensing capability with a remote readout.<br/><br/>The proposed project utilizes an innovative approach to develop a non-invasive sensing system that will provide the ability to constantly monitor skin temperature that would be integrated into a diabetic-friendly insole. Skin temperature has been shown to be a predictive indicator of foot-ulcer development and can additionally be used as a measure of wound healing. A simple system enabling early detection of imminent skin ulceration subsequently reduces further tissue damage, decreasing limb amputations and saving financial, medical and emotional resources. The proof of concept shoe insert is designed to reside daily in a patient's shoes to continuously record the patient's foot health. In addition, the software system, including a mobile app for users as well as a doctor dashboard, is developed as a communication channel between the patient, the healthcare provider and the caregiver.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For years, studies have tried to use isotopic and chemical mass balance calculations to better constrain major fundamental issues such as the structure of mantle convection and determination of the light elements in the core. Much work has focused on chemical partitioning experiments at a large range of both pressures  and temperatures but not on the effect of the stable isotopic fractionation that results from these processes. With this project, the team aims to create new interdisciplinary research at the interface of stable isotope geochemistry and experimental petrology. A graduate and undergraduate student will be engaged and trained in a range of experimental and analytical techniques. This project is highly interdisciplinary and will be of use to petrologists, geochemists, geodynamicists, planetary scientists, cosmochemists and astronomers.<br/><br/>Isotope fractionation will exist between phases with distinct bonding environments, and separation of elements between reservoirs manifests this fractionation. Experiments at high pressure and temperature can reveal equilibrium isotopic fractionation factors that cannot be directly measured in planetary materials, and, when combined with isotopic ratios found in natural materials, provide constraints on the formation conditions of those materials. These researchers will focus on the equilibrium stable isotopic fractionation of iron due to partial melting of the mantle. They aim to understand if and how partial melting of the mantle leaves an isotopic fingerprint on mantle rocks. During the course of this project, a new module will be developed to be part of the Center for Earth and Environmental Science curriculum. It will focus on mantle melting and magma production, which are relevant to volcanic eruptions and environmental hazards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Briefly stated, research identity refers to the ways in which graduate students define themselves as researchers and is an important factor in student success. Specifically, this project will implement and test approaches to foster research identity development for graduate students in non-research-intensive institutions. It should be noted that smaller institutions/programs often face deficiencies that can impact the ability of faculty mentors to foster student research identities both individually and as part of a larger group. In engineering, a faculty advisor generally guides the graduate research experience and the advisor is the primary resource to help graduate students develop their identities as engineering researchers.  Given this apprenticeship model, the mentoring and guidance that a student receives in developing a professional identity is largely dependent on the style, resources, and graduate student group size of the faculty mentor.  This project is testing interventions that could potentially overcome these limitations, particularly for students in smaller graduate programs.<br/><br/>This study on engineering research identity will be conducted at a Carnegie R2 institution (NCAT), a leading producer of African-American engineers, and it will implement a three-pronged approach that is grounded in sociological and psychological theories of identity.   The project entails (1) establishing a Research Engineer Network that will help graduate students develop a research engineer identity; (2) forming Small Research Groups of faculty members with common interests who will foster students' research skills; and (3) designing and administering a survey-based Research Engineer Identity scale and assessment using a mixed-methods research design that includes focus groups, structured interviews, and web-based surveys. The design will culminate with a quasi-experimental test comparing the development of research identify among students participating in the study and a control group of matched students. The three coordinated innovations in this project will collectively build and assess an innovative infrastructure for developing research identify in graduate engineering students. It is anticipated that the project results will be applicable to universities broadly, while particularly informing practice in smaller graduate programs.<br/><br/>The Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program is focused on research in graduate education. The goals of IGE are to pilot, test and validate innovative approaches to graduate education and to generate the knowledge required to move these approaches into the broader community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the current management strategies for vehicular systems are mainly based on individual-level data knowledge, ignoring rich information from a fleet perspective.  In this project, the investigators design and implement a fleet-oriented management strategy for vehicular systems, which utilizes real-time data from sensors installed in all vehicles to improve the overall performance of the vehicular system. In particular, the investigators aim to improve the taxi system performance by using onboard cameras to detect waiting passengers on streets and share this information with nearby vehicles and dispatch centers to pick up these passengers through a dispatching strategy. The research team will develop a clear understanding of how to design an adaptive autonomous vehicular sensing and dispatching strategy to improve urban mobility efficiency from a fleet-oriented perspective, with potential applications to future fully autonomous fleets. Such an understanding on vehicular sensing and dispatch will improve the quality of the every-day life such as more efficient commute for passengers, and lower energy uses for drivers, and finally improve the environment for the society by low vehicle mileage.<br/><br/>This research develops a fleet-oriented sensing and control framework to  enable seamlessly integration of historical and real-time data within a fleet for adaptive vehicular sensing, modeling, and control. Specifically, this project studies how to best use spatiotemporally-correlated contextual information (e.g., vehicular mobility, service demand, disruptive events) among vehicles. Although such correlations decay over time and distance, it is possible to enable autonomous vehicular sensing, modeling, and control adaptively based on the following research to develop novel services: (i) reconfigurable fleet-wide coordinated sensing by autonomously learning correlated vehicular interactions; (ii) models of mobility phenomena by collectively interpreting implicit data from different vehicles with a combination of deep learning, structured learning, and attribute-based learning; (iii) designs of robust dispatching strategies with uncertainty sets and receding horizon control frameworks by iteratively considering fleet-wide knowledge to improve mobility efficiency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are the location of many societally-relevant hazards, including the generation of Earth's deadliest earthquakes, such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake and associated tsunami, and volcanic eruptions such as those at Mt St Helens (1980) and Mt Pinatubo (1991). The processes that lead to these earthquakes and volcanoes are ultimately dependent on the thermal structure of subduction zones - that is how hot it is at great depths. Metamorphic rocks exhumed from ancient subduction zones contain unique records of the temperatures that they witnessed as they traveled down a subduction zone before being exhumed. Geodynamic models and geophysical observations provide estimates of the thermal structures of present-day subduction zones. Interestingly, the rock record suggests significantly warmer conditions than those predicted for modern subduction zones. The proposed work will investigate the reasons for this discrepancy, which may lie in the way we interpret conditions from the rocks, the way they are exhumed, or even in how we compare model predictions and the rock record.<br/><br/>This proposal aims to address the rock-model discrepancy through two key questions: 1) Does our current interpretation of the rock record accurately represent the thermal structure of the associated ancient subduction zone? and 2) Did rocks get exhumed from ancient subduction zones that were hotter on average than modern subduction zones? To address Question 1 this team will determine P-T conditions for metamorphic rocks exhumed from five well-characterized localities that represent a range of thermal structures using relatively new analytical methods: trace element thermometers (e.g. Zr-in-rutile) and mineral inclusion barometers (e.g. quartz-in-garnet barometry). To address Question 2, they will develop geodynamical models of the ancient subduction zones represented by the exhumed rocks. These models will incorporate the effects of region-specific subduction dynamics, such as variations in slab age and subduction rate with time, subduction initiation, ridge subduction, and slab breakoff, when applicable. The model-predicted P-T conditions along the subduction interface will be compared with the newly produced P-T estimates to re-evaluate their disparity. The two-pronged approach of combining petrological observations and geodynamical modeling allows quantitative exploration of the thermal evolution of subduction zones. Subduction-related metamorphic rocks are the only direct samples of material from the plate interface; evaluating the P-T conditions using the latest thermobarometric approaches will provide the team with a more accurate and precise way to untangle the complex history they have experienced. Through geodynamical modeling, the effects of individual parameters on the thermal structure of subduction zones can be isolated, and this targeted approach will allow evaluation of possible explanations for the warm conditions that are recorded by exhumed rocks. The application of the two-pronged approach to the selected ancient subduction localities will allow researchers to determine whether the disparity can be reconciled. The results of this work have important implications for many processes, including geochemical cycling of volatiles, construction of continental crust, and the conditions that lead to arc volcanism. This work will engage graduate students and early career scientists in new collaborations between scientists of different disciplines (petrologists and geodynamicists) and at different institutions both in the US and abroad. EarthCache (TM) sites will be created in California (Franciscan and Catalina) as part of the project. These sites will engage the public in geoscience through the popular activity of geocaching and will disseminate information about subduction zone geology through information tied to direct observations of geologic features exhumed from subduction zones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of the research component is to determine the properties of exotic, neutron-rich nuclear systems that are predicted to exhibit multiple shapes. Through experimentally quantifying this so-called shape coexistence, the research addresses the question, ""How does subatomic matter organize itself and what phenomena emerge"", as outlined by the broader nuclear physics community in ""Reaching for the Horizon: The 2015 Long Range Plan for Nuclear Science"". The experiments investigating shape coexistence are performed at the National Superconducting Cyclotron Laboratory and build on the principal investigator's experience using beta-decay to study exotic nuclei. To expand the impact of this project, the educational component will provide a new and unique physics summer school experience for students with Autism Spectrum Disorder in Mississippi.  By engaging students who are a part of this underserved portion of the population in physics, the opportunities of studying physics and performing research can be shown to a new generation of highly capable scholars. <br/><br/>The research that will be performed as part of this project focuses primarily on determining the lifetimes of excited states in nuclei that are predicted to exhibit multiple coexisting shapes at similar excitation energies. These lifetimes will be utilized to calculate transition strengths, which in turn enable calculations of the degree of deformation of a nucleus in a particular nuclear state. This information on the nuclear deformation serves as a unique fingerprint of different nuclear configurations and a stringent test of theoretical predictions. Transition strength information will be obtained for neutron-rich nuclei near neutron numbers of 20 and 50, which define regions where shape coexistence is predicted to occur yet remains to be quantified.  The objective of the education component is to develop a physics summer school for high-school aged students with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The summer school will offer students with ASD in Mississippi an opportunity to experience physics, including nuclear physics, in a highly interactive way. The summer school will be designed to be a comprehensive postsecondary transition program for students with ASD that will enable them to learn physics, socialization skills, and the opportunities of pursuing research projects and a STEM degree at a 4-year university.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Experimental Nuclear Physics Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When compared with traditional lecturing, studies have shown that active-learning instruction can enhance students' science learning. Active learning is also associated with increased retention of underrepresented minorities in science courses. However, studies also show that the learning gains achieved in active-learning classrooms vary substantially across different instructors. This variation may result because instructors who teach college science courses are highly-trained scientists but may not have formal training in teaching. How effectively instructors teach is likely to be influenced by both their knowledge of the course material and their knowledge about teaching and learning. Thus, we need to better understand what knowledge about teaching and learning is important for facilitating effective active-learning instruction in undergraduate science courses.  This need is especially important in challenging situations, such as biology classes with large numbers of students. In addition, understanding the knowledge about teaching and learning that instructors need to be highly effective would enhance our ability to help instructors to fully realize the potential of active learning for their students.<br/><br/>To advance understanding of instructor knowledge that is essential for planning and facilitating active learning, this project will elucidate instructor knowledge that is positively associated with students' conceptual learning gains in large undergraduate biology courses. The studies will include 100 instructors who use active learning in undergraduate biology courses that have 50 or more students. The investigators will elicit instructor knowledge using pre- and post-instruction interviews, including a stimulated recall approach. They will analyze instructor knowledge exhibited in interviews using qualitative content analysis grounded in theoretical frameworks of instructor knowledge and student conceptual change, as well as prior empirical work. Investigators will use hierarchical linear modeling to examine the associations between instructor knowledge and student conceptual learning gains, as well as the extent to which this relationship is mediated by instructional practices. A second set of investigations will develop longitudinal case studies to characterize how novice active-learning instructors develop knowledge for teaching. These investigations will examine instructor knowledge and practices, the relationship between them, and the factors that influence knowledge development. By examining instructor knowledge, instructional practices, and student learning among active-learning instructors, this research is expected to identify:  instructor knowledge that is associated with effective active-learning instruction; novice instructors' knowledge that professional development can build upon; and the challenges novices encounter as they develop more expertise in active-learning instruction. The project's education plans will apply what is learned through the research to design evidence-based tools that will support current and future biology instructors in using active learning in their classrooms. The project team will implement and assess the effectiveness of a Video Club professional development program for biology graduate students at the University of Georgia. In addition, they will create resources that will be added to the curated, online video collection called the Repository for Envisioning Active-Learning Instruction in Science Education to support instructors in developing the knowledge needed to effectively use active learning.<br/><br/>The Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program is a National Science Foundation (NSF)-wide activity that supports early-career faculty who have the potential to serve as academic role models in research and education.

However, virtual reality may not contain all sensory cues (e.g., smell, scent) and non-perceptual factors (e.g., consequence, time pressure) that would evoke behaviors normally exhibited in the real world. There is limited research on behavioral validity of participants in virtual reality experiments. Thus, the principal goal of this research is to study the validity of human behavior in virtual reality, and thereby strengthen the transferability and generalizability of findings. Researchers will benefit from this work, as they will be able to apply the postulated perceptual-behavioral framework. Society in general will benefit, as private industry will be able to leverage the outcomes and guidelines to yield enhanced virtual reality technologies and other consumer products.   <br/><br/>There are two primary research objectives.  (1) Understand effects of immersion on perceptual-behavioral relationship in an immersive virtual environment. Immersion is a quantifiable measure of virtual reality. A more immersive virtual environment will offer, for example, more extensive cues than a less immersive virtual environment. (2) Study and characterize non-perceptual factors that influence behavioral validity in an immersive virtual environment. Non-perceptual factors include time pressure and consequences (but not life or death because it is virtual).

Through investigations of Inuit foodways at the former Moravian mission of Lichtenau (1774-1974, now Alluitsoq), this project moves archaeological and anthropological studies in southernmost Greenland in a new direction by focusing on the emergence of new ethnic identities (i.e., ethnogenesis) and the sociopolitical dimensions of food during the colonial era. This project will integrate analysis of artifacts, animal bones, fat residue from foods, historic records, and local resident participation to better understand these interactions. The project was designed and will be carried out in conjunction with local Greenlandic communities, the Greenland National Museum and Archives, the University of Greenland, the University of Stirling (Scotland), and the Danish National Museum. Further, project data will be made available to other researchers working in diverse fields ranging from ancient DNA studies to environmental restoration and have applicability to Inuit societies across North America. Finally, the Alluitsoq project builds local capacity to mitigate loss of coastal heritage and takes part in world-wide efforts to save coastal archaeological sites in the Arctic, with implications for Alaskan coastal communities. <br/><br/>Advanced, well-established archaeological and ethnographic methods are integrated with the theoretical perspective of Historical Ecology to answer two research questions: 1) Do foodways exhibit statistically significant changes during the late 18th to early 20th century occupation of Alluitsoq; and 2) are foodways used to generate and perform an emergent ethnic and national Inuit identity in Colonial Greenland's Reconstructing past foodway change and persistence is achieved through an analysis of durable faunal remains that considers represented species, minimum numbers of individuals of different taxa, and processing evidence. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of lipids preserved on artifacts and in sediment deposits reveals the contribution of non-durable or completely consumed foods (e.g., dried peas or wheat flour) to the diet of Alluitsoq residents. Ethnohistoric data from descendant interviews and historic documents build an interpretive framework to assess whether the observed foodway patterns are the result of reconfigured Inuit ethnic identities. To articulate these ethnohistoric data with archaeological results, the researchers use the methods of Grounded Theory to code interviews and documents, identify conceptual categories, and assess the salience of ethnic taxa to the historic and present-day Greenlandic community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research has shown that early intervention for children with social skill deficiencies is critical for success in the classroom and success in life. Children from vulnerable, underserved social niches are particularly likely to be 'less ready' for school, including those who experience poverty, family instability, and trauma, each of which disproportionately impact children from racial and ethnic minority groups. The game being developed by this project empowers educators to provide that much needed social emotional learning support for their young students. First, it provides an affordable, feasible, and scaleable means for identifying the social emotional needs of young students as they transition to formal schooling. Second, it enables educators to quickly translate this formative assessment data into personalized, digital intervention that can be applied with K1 students on a much broader scale than is possible with traditional, in-person services. And lastly, because this innovation is game-based and fun, students are more likely to fully engage and fully benefit from the embedded instruction. <br/><br/><br/>This project will advance understanding of how an Intelligent Tutoring System (ITS) can be used effectively to help educators provide social emotional instruction to all students. Within academic domains such as science and mathematics, many successful ITS implementations have employed learning models where answers to problems and the knowledge being evaluated can be easily represented. However, traditional ITS techniques have not been as effective in domains like social emotional learning, where the connection between what a student does and what the student knows is less well-defined. This project will develop several significant innovations for ITS that apply to social and emotional learning, but may also be useful in other, less well-defined learning domains. These innovations are represented by our adaptive Student Model and Tutorial Manager which collectively enhance student learning via personalization, pacing, and engagement. As more student data is collected, the student model will become increasingly accurate, leading to more intelligent choices from the tutorial manager to better enhance the social tutoring of our innovation and thereby, student learning. In addition to addressing significant societal and market needs, research findings from this SBIR will be published to more broadly inform the efforts of the ITS community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, most of the existing interference management techniques are highly inefficient and not amenable to practical implementation as they require network-wide coordination as well as knowledge of interference characteristics. It is therefore important to develop blind interference cancellation (BIC) techniques that can tame unknown interference in uncoordinated networks. The objective of the proposed research is to develop BIC techniques and use them to advance networking solutions for 5G communications. Success of the proposed research will not only improve spectrum utilization efficiency and flexibility by enabling transparent spectrum sharing between uncoordinated networks, but also reduce the costs of network deployment and maintenance through infrastructure integration for heterogeneous networks. <br/><br/>Although there exist many sophisticated interference management techniques, most of them are limited to cooperative networks where the network nodes have knowledge of interference characteristics (e.g., waveform, frame format, and pilot signals). The goal of this project is to develop BIC techniques that can tame unknown interference by leveraging recent advances in Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology, and use the BIC techniques to advance networking solutions for 5G communications. The proposed research will be carried out through three inter-dependent research thrusts: (1) develop a generic MIMO-based BIC framework that enables a wireless receiver to decode its signal in the face of strong unknown interference; (2) develop a transparent spectrum sharing scheme that allows uncoordinated networks to use the same spectrum at the same time; and (3) integrate a small-cell base station into a multi-antenna Wi-Fi access point (AP) to demonstrate the feasibility of infrastructure sharing between heterogeneous networks (e.g., Wi-Fi and current cellular). The research effort is inter-disciplinary, utilizing communications theory, algorithm and protocol design, as well as cross-layer optimization. The algorithms and protocols developed in this project are complemented by a system-level prototyping and experimentation effort aimed at guaranteeing that the technologies developed are suitable for deployment in real-world wireless systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This cost is primarily associated with generation of silicon powder which is a waste stream and requires energy intensive recycling strategies. Thinner wires can lead to minimal powder generation during wire sawing. However, thinner steel wires (smaller than 100 microns in diameter) break easily under the stress required for efficient cutting of silicon. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award supports scientific investigations on the use of carbon fiber wires smaller than 100 microns in diameter in diamond coated wire sawing of silicon ingots into wafers. Research results from this project will lead to reduced wastage of silicon and, therefore, reduced dollar-per-watt of silicon based solar cells. <br/><br/>The first research objective is to establish relationships between sawing conditions (such as wire velocity and normal force) and the chemical and structural changes of individual diamond particles coated on a carbon fiber wire. The changes observed in the diamond particles are softening (i.e., graphitization), cleavage, blunting, or complete removal from the carbon fiber wire. The approach to achieve this objective is to measure chemical and structural changes after sawing in diamond particles, carbon fiber wire, and generated silicon powder using micro-Raman spectroscopy. This technique can map chemical and structural changes in the diamond particles, carbon fiber wire and the silicon powder with micron scale spatial resolution. An industrial sawing machine, and single crystalline silicon ingots with a 15 cm x 15 cm square cross-section, will be used for sawing experiments. Wire velocities of up to 25 m/s and a normal force of up to 15 N will be used. The second research objective is to understand the effects of wear of diamond particles and carbon fiber on sawing rate. The approach to achieve this objective is to measure, in situ, wire bowing of the diamond coated carbon fiber wire as it performs sawing. This allows estimation of wire tension and frictional forces experienced by the wire inside the silicon kerf during sawing. As wear proceeds, wire bowing increases and so do frictional forces. Sawing rate will be measured as the vertical velocity of the silicon ingot as it presses down on the wire. Parameters such as carbon fiber wire diameter (from 60 m to 100 m) and diamond size (from 6 m to 20 m) will be varied."

Explicit knowledge is conscious-verbalizable knowledge while implicit knowledge is unconscious knowledge of language that is widely held to be a key component for fluent communicative skills. Understanding how L2 knowledge emerges and what processing activities contribute to it is an important area of L2 research that can inform how languages can best be learned and taught. It will also advance researchers' understanding of the cognitive basis of L2 acquisition and to what extent this basis differs from, or is similar to, first language acquisition. <br/><br/>Psycholinguists have studied the relationship between and within L2 knowledge and processing for decades, yet the nature of the interface remains unclear. To demystify the interface debate, a large body of international students in the U.S. will complete a battery of five linguistic knowledge tests three times over twelve months. An untimed written grammaticality judgment test (GJT) and metalinguistic knowledge test will serve as measures of explicit knowledge whereas a timed written GJT, oral production task, and elicited imitation will be used to measure implicit knowledge. Students will also report their engagement in the L2 periodically through a mobile app. Using structural equation modeling, the proposed study addresses two research questions: (1) To what extent does explicit knowledge influence the development of implicit knowledge? (2) To what extent do the amount and type of language processing (i.e., grammar-focused and meaning-focused) contribute to the development of different knowledge types?

For any species, the maximum group size represents a breaking point, where the costs of group-living outweigh the benefits. Yet, most research on the social dynamics of groups has focused on societies with one level of social organization. These ""single-level societies"" are bound to one compromise solution when faced with competing selective pressures - grow in size to protect against predation? Or, shrink in size to alleviate feeding competition? Yet, a few societies have solved this group-size conundrum through the evolution of ""multi-level societies"" - comprising many modular core groups where individuals within the core group are consistent while the associations between core groups can quickly change. This research will explore how individuals transitioned from single- to multi-level societies by investigating the multilevel society of a wild primate, the gelada. This project asks two questions that each focus on a hallmark of gelada society. First, what permanently splits groups apart? And, second, what keeps groups together - forming the higher levels? This project has previously demonstrated that geladas have an unusually high tolerance for strangers. Identifying the mechanisms behind this remarkable tolerance could help us understand the evolution of another species' tolerance for strangers - humans. The directors of this project will continue a long-standing tradition of national and international STEM outreach (http://geladaresearch.org/db) and  significant time investment into conservation efforts in Ethiopia through Save the Simiens, a 501(c)(3) non-profit they created dedicated to protecting the wildlife of the Simien Mountains National Park of Ethiopia where the research takes place. This project is co-funded by the Animal Behavior Program in the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Biological Anthropology Program in the Directorate for Social, Behavioral and Economic Sciences.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to identify how individual interactions lead to the higher-order structure of multi-level societies by harnessing long-term data on multiple core groups of wild geladas (Theropithecus gelada), an easy-to-observe primate with a multilevel society. Specifically, this project will identify: (1) what causes core groups to split up (i.e., fission into two or more core groups) and (2) what causes multiple core groups to remain together (i.e., maintain higher-level cohesion). This research will investigate the fitness consequences of behaviors that produce a multi-level society and examine the mechanistic processes by which group structure may emerge from individual interactions. To understand why groups fission, it is necessary to track network dynamics to examine female social networks before and after a fission to identify the changes in social relationships that may predict an impending fission. To understand higher-level cohesion, this research will use GPS collars to track simultaneous movement across core groups that have (and have not) undergone fission. Thus, these results will identify the ""decay"" in association patterns across time. By identifying the origin of two key features of multilevel societies - small core groups and cohesion among those groups - this research will uncover not just why gelada units fission but how they fission; and this evolutionary pathway can then be tested in other taxa.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Large earthquakes threaten our cities while tiny ones can be used to understand and monitor underground processes. Subsurface fluids play an important role in earthquake source processes. They can trigger fast, destructive, earthquakes or promote slow, nearly-silent, fault slip which can generate weak tremors. To better understand the role of fluids in earthquake processes, the PI will carry out fault-rupture experiments in a controlled laboratory environment on meter-scale rock samples. These experiments will be a stepping stone between previous smaller-scale laboratory studies and larger field studies. In the experiments, sensors will track the fluids on the fault planes and monitor acoustic wave propagation by methods analogous to those used in seismology. The goal is to better understand the role of fluids in the generation of tremors and other seismic signals, and to scale these observations to natural events. This work will improve our capability to interpret seismic observations, notably tremors, hence earthquake hazard assessment. It will also support a graduate student and educational outreaches toward undergraduates and the public.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the fundamental processes underlying fluid-assisted earthquake triggering and frictional slip, and the scaling of laboratory observations to the field. The team will carry out rock-rupture experiments. They will use a new apparatus that squeezes a 3-m slab of granite and can generate magnitude-2.5 dynamic slip events, where rupture nucleation, propagation and termination occur within the sample. These new large-scale experiments with confined ruptures allow simulating natural earthquakes in the laboratory. Over 60 sensors are installed on the sample, the laboratory equivalent of seismic and geodetic networks. The simultaneous measurements link seismic observations to fault slips and stress changes. Fluid injection experiments will be first carried out on small transparent plastic samples, where fluids can be tracked visually, then on meter-scale rock samples where fluids will be monitored acoustically. Finally, the results will be compared to those of 20-m-scale fluid-injection experiments at Grimsel underground laboratory in the central Swiss Alps. The goal is to improve the interpretation of natural earthquake and tremor seismograms, hence earthquake hazard assessment.

The Incorporated Research Institutions for Seismology (IRIS), a consortium of over 120 research universities and institutions dedicated to monitoring the Earth and exploring its interior through the collection and distribution of seismological data, will accomplish this by providing at least 10 undergraduate students per year with research experiences as part of a 9 to 11-week internship program. Participants will attend an intensive week-long preparatory course that will help build a support system amongst the cohort. Then the students will work with leaders in the seismological community, in both lab-base and field-based settings, to conduct research. The program is designed to provide participants with close mentoring from their research mentor and the program's alumni mentor to guide not only their scientific research, but also to enable their own personal growth, skill development, and scientific identity. Throughout the summer students complete weekly assignments designed and sequenced to enable the production of a suite of work products that will become the foundation for presenting their results, provide opportunities to reflect on their work and solidify learning gains, and allow them to benefit from experiences of prior participants. The culmination of each student's internship experience is the opportunity to attend a professional conference and present the results of their summer research.  Such experiences bring closure to the research project, offers undergraduate student interns an opportunity to share their experience and expertise with their new peer community, and provides meaningful exposure to the full spectrum of Earth science research as a viable career option. <br/><br/>The primary work of this project will be to provide undergraduate research opportunities (URO) within the field of seismological research. However, this proposal also seeks to improve the scientific communities understanding of and ability to improve both the short and long-term impacts of UROs on undergraduates as they consider and pursue careers within the geosciences. Through this project we will target three aspects of a URO that, when viewed through the lens of a cognitive apprenticeship, have the ability to influence student outcomes. First, we seek to develop and pilot a curriculum that contributes towards the development of a more inclusive geoscience culture that is resistant to all forms of harassment and discrimination. Next, we seek to develop resources for mentors in the seismology community to successfully assess undergraduates research skills and use these assessments to mentor undergraduates. Finally, we seek to develop resources and programing to enable undergraduates to develop and embrace their own science identity. Data to both measure the impact of the URO on students and efficacy of the resources developed will be collected from both mentors and mentees through surveys, semi-structured interviews, and professional and academic artifacts (e.g. abstracts, papers, technical reports, presentations). The program will also work collaboratively with other REU sites to collect similar data, especially when measuring the efficacy of URO resources.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This market is served by rare earth (RE) magnets based on neodymium-iron-boron and samarium-cobalt. RE magnets are not without issues; they can chip, suffer thermal shock, and can suffer grain boundary corrosion. However, their biggest problems are: price volatility; that China largely controls the RE metals market; and that the extraction of RE metals creates severe environmental degradation. The compound MnAl has been of interest as a permanent magnet since the early 1960s. It has a  theoretical energy product (a measure of its magnetic strength) between that of traditional AlNiCo magnets and RE magnets with a value comparable to that of bonded neodymium-iron-boron magnets. Further, it does  not suffer from the issues associated with RE magnets, and potentially has the lowest cost per unit energy product of any permanent magnet. The magnetic properties of MnAl are affected by the numerous types of defects present, but how these defects affect the magnetic properties and under what conditions these defects occur is unknown. In this project, we will determine both the conditions under which defects and second phases form during processing of MnAl and how these control the magnetic properties. The expectation is that superior magnetic properties can be obtained by carefully manipulating the defect structure. While the work focuses on MnAl, understanding the relationship between the occurrence of defects, their production and their relationship to the magnetic properties in MnAl will be useful for understanding similar behavior in the related compounds MnBi, MnGa, NiFe, PtFe and CoPt, all of which are of interest as hard magnets. The project includes the training of both a Ph.D. student and several undergraduates in state-of-the-art techniques.<br/><br/>Tau-MnAl is a metastable phase that transforms from the high temperature epsilon phase, during which anti-phase boundaries (APBs), twins, stacking faults and dislocations are created. Depending on the processing conditions, the equilibrium beta and gamma 2 phases can also form. The fundamental difficulty with improving the magnetic properties of tau-MnAl is that there is no clear understanding on how they depend on the defect structure. The grain size can also influence the magnetic properties either directly or by affecting the beta and gamma 2 phases arrangement and defect formation. Our aim is to understand both the conditions under which APBs, twins, stacking faults, dislocations and second phases form during processing of tau-MnAl and how these control the magnetic properties. The local chemistry will also be explored at high resolution using atom probe tomography via collaboration with Dr. Baptiste Gault, Max-Planck-Institut fur Eisenforschung, Germany. Our working hypothesis is that we need a strong, c-axis alignment and a low density of APBs, twins and stacking faults (which locally disorder the material) for a high saturation magnetization, while a low density of APBs, twins and stacking faults but a  high dislocation density are required for a high coercivity. It is thought that a fine distribution of beta and gamma 2 phases will also contribute to a high coercivity through magnetic domain wall pinning. While the work focuses on MnAl, understanding the relationship between the occurrence of defects, their production and their relationship to the magnetic properties in MnAl will be useful for understanding similar behavior in the related compounds MnBi, MnGa, NiFe, PtFe and CoPt, all of which are of interest as hard magnets.

However, there is considerable disagreement on how grasslands will respond to environmental change, and the potentially dramatic changes to crop productivity, species invasions, and biodiversity remain unknown. Without a firm understanding of the climatic conditions that caused the spreading of warm-season grasses in the deep past, it is difficult to predict how they will respond in the future. The significant enlargement of grasses' geographic range millions of years ago during the Miocene is the focus of this study. This project is the first to collect data on precipitation and vegetation during the Miocene in South America and to use it to make simulations of ancient climate during this important ecological change. Results are leading to new understanding about how the abundance of warm-season grasses may change in natural and managed landscapes in response to future environmental changes.<br/><br/>The Late Miocene expansion of C4 grasses is one of the most dramatic ecological changes in the past 65 million years. In order to predict how these economically important grasses will respond to future enviornmental change, the factors controlling their past distributions must be understood. In South America, C4 grass expansion was coincident with a strengthening of the South American Summer Monsoon and regional tectonic changes. This project is combining multi-proxy paleovegetation reconstructions with proxy-based paleoclimatic reconstructions and paleoclimatic modeling techniques to understand the linkages between tectonics, climate, and environmental change in South America. Results are leading to new understanding of the conditions under which C4 grasses expanded. A societal benefit of this research includes the ability to make better predictions for how the abundance of C4 grasses may vary in natural and managed landscapes in response to future environmental changes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project intends to place 36 new STEM teachers into high-need schools in the lower Eastern Shore of Maryland, thus enhancing STEM learning in these schools.  In addition, results of project analysis and research should increase understanding of strategies to recruit, educate, and support exceptional secondary STEM teachers.  The project will use first- and second-year school-based internships, together with junior- and senior-level scholarships to encourage and support STEM majors to become secondary mathematics and science teachers.  All STEM majors who participate in the project will work together to design and analyze lessons under the guidance of expert teachers in local schools. The project will revise the teacher education curriculum to increase learning about instructional technology and equity issues in schools. Support for scholarship recipients will continue into their first years of teaching, when the project will provide expert mentor teachers and peer communities to ensure their successful professional induction.  <br/><br/>The project aims to produce 36 new STEM teachers by supporting undergraduates as they complete majors in the fields of biology, chemistry, earth science, mathematics, and physics. The project seeks to motivate 24 first- and second-year STEM majors who are not yet in the professional teacher education program, to pursue teaching by hiring them for early field experience internships.  The project will award junior- and senior- level Noyce scholarships of up to $10,000 per year to 36 academically high-performing STEM majors, with emphasis on including those from underrepresented populations. The scholarship recipients will develop strong knowledge in STEM content and pedagogy as they complete their degree programs. The project will provide an induction program that fosters the development of skilled and reflective practitioners, so that the scholarship recipients will receive support as they graduate and enter the teaching profession. The project seeks to lay the foundation for the long-term retention and success of scholarship recipients as STEM teachers in high-need school settings. Wicomico County Public Schools, a high-need local education agency, will partner with Salisbury University to provide school-based clinical experiences and mentors for the STEM majors. Lesson study, a research-based method for continuous improvement of teaching, will be a key component of the clinical experiences. Quantitative and qualitative data will be gathered to address research questions including: (1) How does lesson study participation influence STEM majors' motivations to teach? (2) To what extent does lesson study encourage academically talented STEM majors to pursue teaching careers? and (3) To what extent does lesson study encourage STEM majors from racial minorities to pursue teaching careers?  Findings related to these research questions will be disseminated at professional conferences and in journals, adding to the knowledge base about effective strategies for preparing STEM teachers for teaching in high-need schools and districts. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts and experienced,exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers. It also supports research on the persistence, retention, and effectiveness of K-12 teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Creativity is the cornerstone and the fundamental motive of both the aesthetic and engineering disciplines. It is a critical element of our economic and social prosperity, as a precursor to scientific discoveries, technological advances, and new forms of cultural and aesthetic experiences. Held every other year in an international location since 1993, C&C serves as a gathering place for the diverse communities of researchers, designers, engineers, and artists who provide an innovative and cross-disciplinary perspective on creativity and cognition as well as technological innovation. C&C is the only ACM-sponsored conference in which human creativity is the central focus, and as such it provides pathways for substantially different kinds of work including interactive art pieces, user studies of creativity support tools, and new sensor technologies for creative practice. It serves as a premier forum for presenting the world's best new research investigating computing's impact on and ability to promote creativity in all forms of human experience. The conference particularly values research that explores new, synergistic roles for computing and people in creative processes, or that addresses situations where computing, as contextualized in sociotechnical systems, may sometimes have an undesirable impact. More information about the 12th conference may be found online at http://cc.acm.org/2019/.  The GSS will bring together up to 12 promising doctoral students (8 of whom will be eligible for funding) and 4 distinguished researchers from academia and industry as mentors, in a day-long event that will be held on June 23, 2019, the day before the main C&C conference. The student submissions will appear in the C&C Proceedings, and they will be indexed in the ACM Digital Library. The students will also be invited to present their work at the main conference during the poster session, which will give their work wider visibility in the community while also affording an opportunity for them to talk one-on-one with peers and other senior researchers. To promote diversity, no more than two graduate students will be accepted from any one institution, and if there are two then at least one of them must be female.<br/><br/>The GSS will provide graduate students with a unique opportunity to present early stage research and receive feedback from mentors with different disciplinary backgrounds. They will gain experience and skills in communicating their own work and critiquing the work of peers. They will come away with new research insights and possible directions, with better understanding of prior work and of the field overall, and with new awareness of potentially useful methods that draw from different disciplines. And they will have the opportunity to build professional and social connections that transcend the event, and to gain awareness of potential career paths in both academia and industry. During the morning, each student will briefly present his or her work in a short formal talk. Mentors will lead a brief discussion of the work, including the research question, method of addressing the question, possible results and findings, significance of the work, and pointers to related work and research areas. The mentors will also offer a critique of each student's written and oral presentation. These discussions will continue through a working lunch. In the afternoon the mentors will lead a broad discussion that relates the presentations to one another and to the other work in the field. They will attempt to highlight common themes that emerged across the individual student works, and note differences and similarities in research methods both across individual research projects as well as across diverse intellectual threads within the creativity and cognition field as a whole. In the last portion of the day, the mentors will lead a discussion on pursuing a career in this interdisciplinary field and what the opportunities are from different disciplinary perspectives (e.g., arts and design vs. technology, or academia vs. industry).  The GSS will conclude with a working dinner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

General, historical interpretations and descriptions of the landscape were replaced by detailed studies to understand processes at fine scales using quantitative techniques. Soon thereafter, new tools and technology improved data collection techniques and expanded observations, providing geomorphologists with a wealth of data to reveal new research questions. Contemporary geomorphology has become a challenging system science that evaluates the interaction and complex connectivity among many variables and incorporates many other disciplines. The history of the discipline is an important educational resource that can be used to help shape perspectives of modern geomorphologists. The 50th Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium (BGS) will be a milestone event which provides an introspective assessment of the past and future of the discipline. The agenda for this BGS aims to make the event more student friendly and diverse. The plans include a peer mentoring program called ""Rocky Mountain Rendezvous"" to connect students and senior researchers, coordination with Diversity Officers and Equal Opportunity Offices at local colleges, and a panel discussion designed to address the challenges of inclusivity. A Diversity and Inclusion Statement will be developed and included in conference materials as well as on the website.<br/><br/>During the past 50 years, BGS has offered many benefits to the scientific community, culminating in 25 special issues of Geomorphology and other book publications for the early symposia. The longevity and continued success of the BGS to advance the discipline has been recognized at a global scale. The symposium continues to provide a prominent forum for established and emerging scientists to present, exchange, and disseminate methods, techniques, and results on geomorphic research to the global community. Because of its size and focus, the symposium offers an unrivalled opportunity to engage actively in discussion with a broad range of scientists linked by the discipline. Opportunities for scientists, researchers, and students to interact closely in single-session symposium for an extended period are virtually non-existent at large society meetings such the American Geophysical Union (AGU), Association of American Geographers (AAG), and Geological Society of America (GSA). Whereas the symposium will contribute substantially to the scientific foundations of geomorphic research, it also will address topics of great importance and relevance to society, including topics such as natural hazards, environmental change, human impacts, landscape evolution and management, and policy.

Additional international graduate students will also take part in the event, however funding to support those students from non-US institutions is not requested from NSF.  Virtual reality is a multidisciplinary field involving human-centered computer simulations that seek to imitate or augment real world senses (usually sight, sound, and touch) and experiences.  VR research includes the development and assessment of methods and systems, and facilitating and understanding user perceptions, beliefs, and behaviors.  First organized by the IEEE Computer Society in 1993 and held annually since 1995, IEEE Virtual Reality is the premier international conference and exhibition in this field and includes technical paper presentations, workshops, tutorials, research demonstrations, and exhibits from industry.  Based on prior year participation, the organizers expect IEEE VR 2019 to attract approximately 350-400 attendees; more information about the conference may be found online at http://www.ieeevr.org/2019.  The goal of the Doctoral Consortium is to provide a unique venue for interactive, supportive, and prestigious mentoring for mid-level graduate students in virtual reality, to afford these students a valuable opportunity to get independent perspectives on their research from senior individuals with a wide collective breadth and depth of knowledge, and to build a cohort of young researchers within the VR community.  Due to this year's timing constraints, the DC student participants have already been selected; special efforts were made to recruit participants from groups traditionally underrepresented in the field of computer science, including women, persons of color, and people with disabilities.<br/><br/>This year's IEEE VR Doctoral Consortium builds on the successful format of the previous such events, which were also supported by NSF.  The main activities of the workshop will take place on Saturday, March 23.  The full-day event will include morning and afternoon sessions in which each student presents his/her work to the other student participants and a panel of senior VR researchers, with sufficient time set aside after each talk for discussion and constructive feedback that addresses the strengths of the work, challenges and issues that may arise, and implications of the results.  A group working lunch attended by all the students and mentors will be particularly valuable for unifying the individual goals and projects presented within the group as part of a ""big picture"" envisioning of the future of the field.  Additionally, a dinner will be held on Saturday, March 23, to welcome the students and provide initial mentorship and tips for networking at the conference.  Beyond the main event and dinner on Saturday, small groups of 2-3 students will meet on an additional day during the week for mentoring lunches and other networking events with senior members of the VR research community.  DC attendees will also take part in a poster session, which will give them more opportunities to network and discuss their research.  The conference organizers will generously provide as much financial support as possible to the DC through the conference's budget, including meeting space, audio-visual rental, and food and beverage during breaks for free.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In these places, the collection of some other type of information can be remarkably useful in understanding flow patterns. This project investigates how fragments of biological material can be used in predicting river and stream flows. The biological material investigated in this project is the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) of microbes found within water samples. This material can be collected and analyzed quickly, easily, and inexpensively. By using advanced biological techniques, the DNA found in streams can be translated into the relative abundance of different types of microbes. This project is based on the understanding that different environmental conditions, including flow patterns in rivers, cause different populations of microbes to become more or less abundant. This project supports an interdisciplinary group of faculty and students to develop new tools that relate stream and river microbes to hydrologic flow patterns. The project partners with a local organization focused on connecting under-represented communities with science professionals.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the collection and sequencing of streamwater DNA at a suite of long-term gauging stations spanning a range ecohydrologic conditions across the Pacific Northwest. Using 16s rRNA amplicon sequencing, the relative abundance of different microbial community members is quantified at each location, and patterns in community composition is related to river flows with machine learning techniques. These methods are then extended to regional and national level datasets of streamwater microbiome composition to determine the macroscale hydrologic information contained within streamwater DNA at different scales. For the duration of this project, a team consisting of high-school, undergraduate, and graduate students is engaged in advanced biological, hydrologic, and machine learning techniques to investigate connections between streamwater DNA and watershed function. Both hydrologic and microbial tools and techniques developed through this project will be disseminated to the wider community in a variety of forms, including traditional scholarly outlets and as open-source interactive electronic text for general education about hydrology.

While much is known about the biological processes largely responsible for the transfer of carbon into the deep sea, very little is known about the microbial decay and subsequent remineralization processes that occur when the carbon reaches the deep sea.  Using newly-designed deep-sea incubators deployed off the east coast of the United States, researchers will explore the microbial communities and remineralization processes that transform carbon in the deep sea. The incubators will be filled with tracer-labeled algae or fecal material mimicking the diet and waste products of animal plankton. The tracers allow the researchers to follow the material through the microbial food web, and simultaneously determine the net release of carbon dioxide during the incubations. Using a combination of genetic analysis and novel analytical techniques, the researchers will be able to identify the organisms involved in the decay processes and rates at which changes occur at the single-cell level. Results will shed light on these understudied biological phenomena and contribute to an improved understanding of the global carbon cycle. In addition to novel advancements in oceanographic technology, the research supports graduate and undergraduate student education, and public outreach through partnerships with the Virginia Aquarium and National Ocean Sciences Bowl to increase ocean science literacy. <br/><br/>In this project, researchers will study the organisms, mechanisms, and physical and ecological factors that modulate the remineralization of organic material in the deep sea. The methods include using in situ incubations of well-defined and stable isotope-labeled sources of organic carbon (live and dead phytoplankton and fecal pellets of zooplankton) with natural microbial communities. The incubations will take place northeast of Cape Hatteras, a region characterized by strong offshore transport of phytoplankton carbon. Net carbon dioxide release rates will be measured over time by conversion of Carbon-13 labeled organic carbon to 13CO2 . The dependence of degradation rates on the source material, seasonality, oxygen concentration, and the type of microbial colonizers will be assessed. Parallel laboratory experiments will elucidate the exact shape of the time course of carbon release by phytoplankton into dissolved organic and inorganic fractions as well as determine how representative laboratory and ship-board generated values are relative to those obtained in situ. Target eukaryotic and prokaryotic taxa are identified by fluorescence in-situ hybridization (FISH) after the incubations and individually interrogated using Raman microspectrometry to investigate the relative Carbon-13-enrichment rates in organisms assimilating labeled detrital carbon. This multi-faceted approach will provide better constrained parameters for ecosystem and biological pump models and shed light on carbon balances of the deep sea. The research contributes to the development of new oceanographic technology, including new deep-sea incubators and application of single-cell Raman microspectrometry to natural microbial communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since 2005, the iConferences have provided a forum where information scholars, researchers and professionals from around the world gather to share insights on critical information issues in contemporary society.  An openness to new ideas and research fields in information science is a primary characteristics of these events, which have been successful in bringing together people who otherwise might rarely interact with one another, thereby helping to promote interdisciplinary research.  Recent iConferences have drawn close to 500 attendees, a testament to participants' appreciation for the inspiring sense of community, high quality research presentations, and myriad opportunities for engagement. The iConferences are presented by the iCaucus, now a consortium of 87 schools within the United States and abroad  (plus 10 associate members) ,dedicated to advancing the information field and preparing students to meet the information challenges of the 21st Century.  This year's theme is ""inform | include | inspire"".  The iConference doctoral colloquia traditionally bring together the best of the next generation of interdisciplinary researchers focused on the interplay of information and technology in a social context, allowing them to develop a network both among themselves and with senior researchers. Participation is encouraged from a broad range of relevant disciplines, thereby expanding attendees' perspectives on their topics of study and promoting advancement of the field.<br/><br/>The 2019 Doctoral Colloquium will be tightly integrated into the conference experience, starting with a full-day event on Sunday March 31, the first day of the iConference.  The primary objective of the Doctoral Colloquium is to help train the next generation of information science researchers. To this end, it will provide the student participants with an environment in which they can share and discuss their goals, methods and results in order to gain feedback on their work both from the mentors and from other students, which should allow them to enhance their research.  The student participants will come away with a better understanding of the various research communities engaged in the study of information science, and they will learn how to position their work within the field.  At the end of the day, a closing plenary session will provide an opportunity for the faculty mentors to discuss various professional issues, such as the job market, getting grants to support research, negotiating work-life balance, and developing one's research program post-Ph.D.  Thus, the colloquium will provide students with the chance to make new professional connections beyond their own disciplines and institutions, and it will also help them successfully launch their careers whether in industry or academia.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Considering households that are heterogenous with respect to their consumption, income, wealth, and information sets imposes challenges in modeling. This research develops a codebase in modelling heterogenous decision makers using recent advances in theory and computation. The developed toolkit will include codes, extensive documentation in the form of notebooks, as well as teaching materials. The developed codebase will provide researchers and policy makers a useful toolkit in considering heterogenous households by simplifying the computation and estimation of complex macroeconomic models.  <br/> <br/>This research on heterogenous agent models leverages new advances on the computation of equilibria in sequence space by jointly solving the equations characterizing equilibrium across all periods for time paths of the unknowns, given initial conditions on the distribution and other states. For models that are linearized to first order with respect to aggregates, the sequence and the state space approaches deliver the same impulse responses, but the sequence space has computational advantages for heterogeneous-agent models: it allows for a wider class of shocks, is easily scalable, and can achieve large speed gains. The developed toolkit will require as input the equations characterizing equilibrium, including specification of heterogeneous-agent ?blocks?. The toolkit will then automatically perform computation of steady state and transition dynamics for given shocks. Extensions will allow estimation as well as computation of optimal policy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the centuries, cryptography has advanced, from ad hoc secret codes that can be broken by hand, to methods based on number theory which remain secure even against adversaries using super-computers.  As algorithms from number theory have advanced, our codes for protecting data have also progressed in efficiency: NASA regularly transmits clear pictures of terrain on faraway planets, using error-correcting codes that cut through the noise of solar flares, cell phones, and radio transmissions. As our communication methods have evolved, we are naturally led to deep mathematical problems which must be solved before we can make further progress. Some of these problems are also deeply connected to central questions in complexity theory and new advances in optimization.<br/><br/>The investigators will focus on advanced techniques toward tackling central problems in circuit complexity and pseudo-randomness. In particular, they will apply recent advances in arithmetic geometry to the construction of new pseudo-random generators and new complexity lower bounds. One technique the investigators will pursue is their recent discovery of an efficient method to count solutions of polynomial equations over finite rings. This technique will help analyze a new family of pseudo-random generators with potentially better unpredictability than earlier constructions based on discrete logarithms and factoring. The research team will also use techniques from real and p-adic geometry to study the number of integer solutions to structured polynomials. The latter problem is one of the few recent methods with the potential to yield new lower bounds for circuit complexity and a better understanding of the P vs. NP question. In addition to this algorithmic research, the investigators will train graduate students, and use all work from this project to develop new content for courses and outreach programs for younger students.

For years, studies have tried to use isotopic and chemical mass balance calculations to better constrain major fundamental issues such as the structure of mantle convection and determination of the light elements in the core. Much work has focused on chemical partitioning experiments at a large range of both pressures  and temperatures but not on the effect of the stable isotopic fractionation that results from these processes. With this project, the team aims to create new interdisciplinary research at the interface of stable isotope geochemistry and experimental petrology. A graduate and undergraduate student will be engaged and trained in a range of experimental and analytical techniques. This project is highly interdisciplinary and will be of use to petrologists, geochemists, geodynamicists, planetary scientists, cosmochemists and astronomers.<br/><br/>Isotope fractionation will exist between phases with distinct bonding environments, and separation of elements between reservoirs manifests this fractionation. Experiments at high pressure and temperature can reveal equilibrium isotopic fractionation factors that cannot be directly measured in planetary materials, and, when combined with isotopic ratios found in natural materials, provide constraints on the formation conditions of those materials. These researchers will focus on the equilibrium stable isotopic fractionation of iron due to partial melting of the mantle. They aim to understand if and how partial melting of the mantle leaves an isotopic fingerprint on mantle rocks. During the course of this project, a new module will be developed to be part of the Center for Earth and Environmental Science curriculum. It will focus on mantle melting and magma production, which are relevant to volcanic eruptions and environmental hazards.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The dominate parasitic dinoflagellate group found in international global ocean surveys is referred to as MALV II Syndiniales. In the planktonic environment, the MALV II Syndiniales group not only exerts top-down controls on their prey populations, but based on their apparent ubiquity and abundance, they likely shape the pools of nutrients in marine water columns. Data on cultured samples reveals this hyper-diverse group can infect a wide range of protist hosts, as well as copepods, and fish larvae. Gaps in knowledge of the specificity and dynamics of the host-parasite interactions contribute to difficulties in estimating the impacts on the coastal ecosystems. In this project, researchers combine novel methods in microscopy, genomics, and chemistry to track host-parasite dynamics at a coastal site over an annual cycle followed by modeling to assess the impacts on microbial ecosystem dynamics. The researchers will engage undergraduate and high school students in field and laboratory research activities. In addition, support for a graduate student is included along with plans to disseminate the research results more broadly through publications and presentations.<br/><br/>Syndiniales parasitism is a widespread, albeit under-studied symbiotic interaction in the marine environment and little is known about regulation of protist populations by these parasites. In spite of their cosmopolitan distribution in the global ocean and their apparent abundance in molecular datasets of protist marker genes, little is known about the ecology of these parasites and almost no genomic data exists for them. In this project, the researchers combine high-resolution sampling, water chemistry (including nutrients) analyses, molecular marker gene analyses, fluorescence in situ hybridization, single cell genomics, and modeling to produce the first focused assessment of host-MALVII parasite dynamics and ecology at the community level in a coastal marine ecosystem. The researchers will evaluate temporal dynamics of host and parasite diversity and will examine temporal variation in levels of infection of the protist community and host-parasite specificity using high-resolution sampling in Salt Pond, Falmouth, MA, and in situ hybridization microscopy. Molecular approaches include amplicon tag high throughput sequencing, leveraging the emerging third generation sequencing technology, Oxford Nanopore's MinION to elucidate host-parasite identities. The researchers will also apply advances in single-cell genome sequencing to inform on strain-specific genome content, including the molecular mechanisms underpinning protist parasitism.  Contributions to pools of particulate and dissolved organic matter will be estimated for several of the most commonly infected host taxa in Salt Pond using laboratory experiments, providing the first set of values for modeling impacts of Syndiniales parasitism on pools of organic and inorganic nutrients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

International energy agencies note that if transport is to contribute to CO2 reductions to meet the 2 degree C global average temperature target, use of technologies such as hybrid electric and all electric transportation will have to increase in the future. Thus, advances in transportation technologies are clearly a national and international issue, and require globally-minded engineers and scientists to advance interdisciplinary technologies to develop cleaner regional and global transportation systems. Virginia Tech (VT) proposes to expand upon the Future Electric Transportation Systems ( FETS) IRES partnership with the University of Nottingham (UoN), with a broadened scope and stronger engagement with industry and the UK government to establish the Energy, Environment, and Future Electric Transportation Systems (E-FETS) IRES program. E-FETS cohorts of ~9 per year will investigate next generation electrical power systems for environmentally-friendly fuels and extraction methods; energy-efficient, hybridized power train vehicles and systems; light-weighting of vehicle structures; and the human factors issues that accompany their use and adoption. Among the broader impacts of this IRES program are the promotion of international research collaborations that foster innovative technical leaders capable of creating and effectively integrating electric transportation systems into our society as a means to address efficient energy use.  <br/><br/>E-FETS will provide an intensive ten-week research experience to undergraduates and graduate students with five of the University of Nottingham's internationally recognized research groups. These include power electronics, human factors, geo-energy, composites and manufacturing, and aerospace propulsion and advanced diagnostics. The program will consist of two phases. The first phase includes three pre-departure workshops plus three weeks of mentorship and research preparation at VT to orient students to the experience and the project scope. This pre-departure preparation aims to build the E-FETS student cohort team in preparation for their work individually and together. The second phase consists of 7 weeks at the UoN engaged in concentrated research with UoN faculty mentors and facilities. In addition to supervision from a VT and UoN faculty member, students will work collaboratively as part of a large research team including faculty, Ph.D. students and postdoctoral research fellows. To facilitate additional professional development, students will also be matched with an industry mentor who will meet with the student before, during and after their research experience. These mentors will enhance the students? experience with international career exploration, professional development, and networking in their field and industry. Seminars focused on the scope of E-FETS research goals are planned during each phase of the program, providing students with the opportunity to connect their individual research projects with the unified research theme of E-FETS, and present and get feedback on their IRES experience.

In response to this need, the NSF has funded 19 five-year Revolutionizing Engineering and Computer Science Departments (RED) projects from 2015-17, with a call for new proposals published in 2018. The preliminary results from funded RED projects show many examples of success. Transformative organizational change is difficult, however, and most project teams have navigated challenges related to leadership team dynamics. Most of these challenges are not shared with the broader community, in part, because of a fear of identifying individuals and of highlighting failures instead of successes. Yet, understanding the challenges associated with relationships in leadership teams is critical to making revolutionary change in engineering education. This project will develop a deeper understanding of team dynamics in large-scale engineering teams. This new knowledge will ultimately increase the effectiveness of RED teams and their organizational change initiatives, and will have implications for other large-scale initiatives such as Engineering Research Centers.<br/><br/>This exploratory research project is focused on developing a critical understanding of roles, perspectives, and relationships within RED teams and the potential impact of these concepts on creating and sustaining organizational change to improve the education of engineers nationwide. The NSF PFE/IUSE: RED solicitation requires the inclusion of faculty and administrators who serve in specific roles and from specific backgrounds; this project develops an understanding of the lived experiences of the individuals who served in these roles on teams funded from 2015-2017. In particular, the work will investigate how the experiences of team members shape attempts at organizational change. The project explores the following research questions: How do roles, perspectives, relationships, and structures shape how teams face, frame, and navigate challenges and tensions, as they work towards revolutionary organizational change in engineering education? How have RED team roles, perspectives, relationships, and structures evolved over time? <br/><br/>Data collection and analysis include artifact analysis of proposal documents, project websites, and shared RED documents. Narrative interviews with members of RED leadership teams, including principal investigators, social scientists, engineering education researchers, and disciplinary engineering faculty members will also be conducted. These data will be analyzed to identify larger patterns across interviews and develop broader themes. Findings will be disseminated in traditional venues, in workshops, and through white papers. By looking at the experiences of RED team members within specific roles across RED sites, key aspects of RED team dynamics (that cannot be reported on easily in individual teams because of the identifiable nature these roles) will be uncovered.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will do so by providing scholarships and educational opportunities to approximately 80 students who transfer from a community college in Washington to the University of Washington.  These Scholars will pursue bachelor's degrees in ""materials-intensive"" engineering fields, including Chemical Engineering, Materials Science and Engineering, and Mechanical Engineering. This project involves a partnership between the University of Washington and four community colleges in the greater Seattle region:  Edmonds Community College, Everett Community College, Green River Community College, and Seattle Central Community College.  Transfer students from these colleges will be selected to receive two-year scholarships to complete their bachelor's degrees at the University of Washington. These graduates will be eligible for an additional one-year scholarship to pursue a master's degree.  The project aims to support community college students with enrichment activities that are predicted to an increase their successful completion of degrees in materials-intensive engineering fields. <br/><br/>The specific goals of the project are to: i) double the number of transfer students who apply for admission to the materials-intensive departments; ii) increase the number of students from underrepresented groups in the materials-intensive departments; and iii) upon graduation, successfully place the Scholars in full-time STEM employment, graduate school, or an international experience.  The program will implement a blend of new and proven practices to achieve its goals.  Programming highlights include an advising outreach program brought from the University of Washington to the community colleges, a student mentor ladder that spans from regional high school students to graduates who were supported by the project, and a choice of experiential activities involving engagement of the Scholars in faculty research projects, industrial internships, and/or an international exchange experience at Tohoku University in Japan.  The program will also integrate academic and professional development activities to build community and promote the Scholars' academic and personal growth. Using a mixed-methods approach that includes surveys, focus groups and institutional data, the program's research study aims to identify the factors that influence community college students to pursue and complete bachelor's and, potentially, master's degrees in materials-intensive fields.  Additionally, the study aims to determine the impact of the project elements on student self-efficacy, achievement levels, and professional identity.  The efforts of this program have the potential to substantially impact the materials-intensive departments at the University of Washington and to yield a model that is broadly applicable, both across the State of Washington and nationally.  This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics Program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.

The goal of the workshop is to bring together experts to discuss and develop plans for a future aircraft campaign to investigate wintertime particulate matter (PM) in the mountain basins of the Western U.S. The outcome of the project will be a white paper outlining the scope and plan for a future aircraft and ground-based field campaign.  Early career scientists will be given priority for travel support,<br/><br/>Despite the now extensive knowledge of atmospheric chemistry and the formation of PM, existing models do not reproduce pollutant concentrations in several air basins in the Western US. The chemistry in these regions is significantly impacted by the boundary layer meteorology which can confine the pollution mixture below the height of surrounding terrain for an extended period. During the PCAPs local and regional emissions accumulate and age, changing the composition of the PM. While previous field studies have investigated the boundary and atmospheric chemistry individually, no studies have collected a suite of data needed to assess their interactions. Additionally, because precursors of PM are often emitted with GHGs, both will be impacted by GHG mitigation plans. The goal of this workshop is to bring together research leaders and young scientists in the boundary-layer meteorology, atmospheric chemistry, and urban carbon cycle communities to develop joint and complementary science objectives for a large measurement campaign in the western U.S. Discussions will focus on the following topics: 1) the impact of agricultural emissions, residential wood combustion, and volatile chemical products on wintertime air quality; 2) the data and parameterizations needed to improve models of wintertime PCAPs; 3) the impact of inter-basin transport and vertical stratification of PCAPs; 4) the emission ratios between PM precursors and GHGs; and 5) how GHG mitigation actions might affect wintertime air quality. The broader impacts of this project will be the development of a document to guide development of a future field campaign focused on addressing these scientific goals. Additionally, the workshop organizers have existing relationships with state and local air quality management agencies and the scientific knowledge and data obtained in this effort would be used to address current challenges within air quality management.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Key challenges herein are to decide what criteria to optimize, and what algorithms to use for performing the optimization. These challenges underlie the motivation for the present project. More specifically, this project seeks to make progress on three fundamental topics in optimization for ML: (i) theoretical foundations for a rich new class of optimization problems that can be solved efficiently (i.e., in a computationally tractable manner); (ii) a set of algorithms that apply to large-scale optimization problems in machine learning (e.g., for accelerating the training of neural networks); and (iii) theory that seeks to understand and explain why do neural networks succeed in practice. By focusing on topics of foundational importance, this project should spur a variety of followup research that deepends the connection of  ML and AI with both mathematics and the applied sciences. More broadly, the this project may have a lasting societal impact too, primarily because of (i) its focus on optimization particularly relevant to ML and AI; (2) the non-traditional application domains it connects with (e.g., synthetic biology); and (3) because the investigator is in an environment that fosters such impact (namely, the Institute for Data, Systems, and Society (IDSS), a cross-disciplinary institute at MIT whose mission to drive solutions to problems of societal relevance). Finally, the project has an education centric focus; it involves intellectual and professional development of students, as well as development of curricular material based on the topics of research covered herein.<br/><br/>This project lays out an ambitious agenda to develop foundational theory for geometric optimization, large-scale nonconvex optimization, and deep neural networks. The research on geometric optimization (which is a powerful new subclass of nonconvex optimization), is originally motivated by applications in ML and statistics; however, it stands to have a broader impact across all disciplines that consume optimization. The investigator seeks to develop a theory of polynomial time optimization for a class strictly larger than usual convex optimization problems, and thereby endow practitioners with new polynomial time tools and models; if successful, this investigation could open an entire subarea of research and applications. Beyond geometric optimization, the project also focuses on large-scale nonconvex optimization and on the theory of optimization and generalization for deep learning. Within these topics, the project will address key theoretical challenges, develop scalable new algorithms that could greatly speed up neural network training, and also make progress that reduces the gap between the theory and real-world practice of nonconvex optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Extreme ultraviolet lithography has emerged as a leading technique that can enable this. However, its performance is limited by the amount of ultraviolet light that can be produced. Optical mirrors used in these systems cannot withstand extremely high optical intensities and often fail, thus limiting the reliability of the system and increasing the production cost. This Grant Opportunity for Academic Liaison with Industry (GOALI) award addresses the need for better mirrors and develops a novel nanomanufacturing technique that allows for optical components to be fabricated in diamond. This is challenging since diamond is one of the hardest materials to shape. The team leverages expertise in material science, nano-machining, optics, and laser physics to overcome these challenges and develop a novel and scalable nanomanufacturing technique. This project has the potential to transform the way chips are made, which has great economic and societal impact owing to the ubiquitous presence of micro-chips in everyday life. In addition to the semiconductor industry, nano-machined diamond components have broad and direct impact on many technologies that use high power lasers, including defense, medicine, and automotive industry. The team's findings are shared with the general public through continued collaborations with Museum of Science (Boston), giving public lectures, and participating in science fairs. <br/><br/>In extreme ultraviolet source a high-power carbon-dioxide laser is focused onto micron-scale tin droplets, thus vaporizing them and resulting in plasma that gives off extreme ultraviolet light. Despite many decades of work, the overall conversion efficiency (infrared to ultraviolet) is only a few percent. As a result, kilowatts of infrared power are required, which demands better mirrors, since currently used ones often fail at high optical intensities. This project develops a novel nano-machining technique for forming three-dimensional nanostructures on the surface of bulk diamond surfaces, that feature > 99% reflectivity. Such diamond mirrors can handle much larger optical intensities and have much longer lifetime than state-of-the-art mirrors. In addition, the team develops a wide range of high-power diamond-based optical components, including filters, polarizers, wave-plates, and beam combiners. This collaborative effort focuses on fundamental understanding of nano-machining of optical surfaces from bulk materials and industry-university relationship through interactive research and exchange of students and engineers.

The STDC is one of the longest standing regular conferences in general topology, having started in 1967 and continuing as an annual conference.  It attracts participants nationally and internationally.  The STDC regularly attracts over 150 participants, and often over 200.  There are 7 plenary talks and 12 semi-plenary talks in most areas of topology and its applications by established researchers.  Talks bridging two or more research areas are encouraged.  In a highly technological society like the USA, a high level science research, and in particular mathematics research, is crucial for further progress. Conferences are an essential part for developing successful and competitive research programs in mathematics and for the education of young researchers. The STDC has played an essential part in the success and education of many of its participants. The conference will include contributed talks by PhD students, post-doctoral students, as well as junior mathematicians, and will encourage diversity among speakers.  There are six special sessions in subareas of topology including a new session in Topology and Graph Theory. More information and an invitation to participate may be found at the conference website:  http://www.uab.edu/cas/mathematics/mathnews/stdc<br/> <br/>The 53rd Spring Topology and Dynamical Systems Conference will run six special sessions: Continuum Theory, Dynamical Systems, Geometric Topology, Geometric Group Theory, Set<br/>Theoretic Topology, and Topology and Graph Theory that will include most topics of contemporary research in topology as well as highlighting connections between topology and other mathematical subjects.

Such settings are pervasive in the natural sciences and engineering, where in-depth investigation can require human intervention, expensive computer simulation, or costly laboratory experiments.  Humanity is at the tipping point of a data revolution, and our ability to collect and store information will likely outpace our capacity to extract useful knowledge from data. Active machine learning provides a solution to this dilemma: we adaptively design expensive experiments guided by statistical models of the underlying process to make the most-effective use of limited resources. Numerous studies have established active machine learning as a promising tool for automating scientific discovery; however, modern procedures are currently difficult for practitioners to adopt. Considerable expertise is required to effectively use the available tools, especially as the field of machine learning continues to develop rapidly. This project will transform the application of active machine learning to problems from science and engineering, developing novel experimental procedures and pioneering new paradigms of scientific discovery. This project will also dramatically increase the availability of these methods to non-experts through automation, facilitating the further integration of machine learning into practice across disciplines. All research will be motivated by problems and validated on data from applications across science and engineering, including materials science, drug discovery, astronomy, and robotics. The project's research objectives will be accompanied by a comprehensive education plan designed to introduce active machine learning to a broad range of future scientists and engineers.<br/><br/>The project will entail two broad themes of inquiry, corresponding to the two critical components of an active learning pipeline: (1) experimental policies and (2) modeling. (1): The core of an active learning procedure is its policy, which decides which data to analyze. A primary challenge when building an active learning system is developing a computationally efficient and empirically effective policy for the given learning objective. This is not a straightforward task: the optimal procedure is computationally infeasible and natural approximations can suffer from myopic, greedy behavior. This project will improve the performance and theoretical understanding of policies for automated scientific discovery, developing and studying both established and novel paradigms for active scientific discovery. A theme throughout this investigation will be nonmyopic decision making, where one reasons about the impact of each decision on the entire learning task. Algorithmic development will be accompanied by extensive theoretical study, establishing fundamental learning bounds and seeking efficient approximation schemes when possible. (2): The second thrust of the investigation will be on modeling complex processes from data, as a policy's success hinges on being guided by an informative model. Model selection for active learning is rendered difficult by inherently limited training data, and accounting for model uncertainty is often critical. The project will investigate automated model selection inline with active learning, advancing the nascent field of automated machine learning to create robust, fully automated active learning systems that do not require expert design or tuning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Strikingly, in all of these media, the absence of solid matter, called the porous space, triggers processes that lead to instabilities of the solid structure and/or of the fluid flow. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) site award, titled ""Mechanics of Porous Media across Scales - Research Experience in Paris"" (MPMS Paris), supports U.S. students for immersion in cutting-edge poromechanics research laboratories in Paris, France. The award aims to expose Georgia Tech students to poromechanics research applied to civil, environmental and biomechanical engineering, to immerse them in the academic culture of leading European institutions based in Paris, and to inspire them in the pursuit of a scientific career to create resistant, sustainable and safe porous materials in response to infrastructure, energy and health demands. IRES participants will do a 10-week research internship in one of several host laboratories at leading partners institutions in Paris under the supervision of dual mentors from Georgia Tech and the MPMS Paris partner. The project includes experienced teams who collaborated on a prior IRES award and teams new to the collaboration. Pre- and post- internship activities will be organized in partnership with Georgia Tech international education programs and the Science and Technology Department at the Consulate General of France in Atlanta. IRES participants will take ownership of a research project in elite engineering laboratories, acquire language skills and have longer exposure to history, technology and society than in a regular curriculum. The integration of activities for faculty and undergraduate and graduate students is expected to sustain long-term collaborations between groups focusing on experimental, theoretical and numerical research in poromechanics.<br/><br/>Technical description. A multi-scale approach is needed to gain a fundamental understanding of the complex phenomena that occur in porous media subjected to mechanical and environmental solicitations, such as hysteretic flow and adsorption, fracture initiation and propagation, in-pore crystallization and damage development, resin infiltration and tissue restoration. The IRES site will gather a community of scientists including world experts in theoretical poro-mechanics and thermodynamics, from Navier and IFSTTAR at Ecole des Ponts Paris Tech (a top European program in applied mathematics and mechanics), MSSMat at Centrale-Supelec (a top European program in mechanical and electrical engineering) and LMS at Ecole Polytechnique (the most selective engineering school in France). Host laboratories are equipped with unique experimental, imaging and material processing facilities and are located on the campuses of French ""Grandes Ecoles"", which are elite engineering programs. Fundamental research in the physics and mechanics of porous materials will combine cutting-edge simulation tools with advanced experimental and imaging techniques to establish multi-scale models that can capture coupled bio-thermo-hydro-chemo-mechanical processes and predict the sustainability and durability of engineered systems. Teams of dual mentors will foster long-term collaborations by working with several cohorts of IRES students on a core research topic. The IRES program will also support travel expenses for mentors to further enhance the student experience and collaborative research activities. The project will support the successful collaborations established through a prior IRES award led by the PI, expand the program to a larger and more diverse group of scholars and ensure a bilateral flow of scholars between Georgia Tech and Paris.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This method provides an alternative or complimentary reservoir permeability enhancement solution to current high-pressure water/acid injection-based method such as hydraulic or acid fracking. This proposed innovation will allow for an economical permeability increase without water contamination and induced seismic activities.

In this method, the conductivity of the geofluid along with the pulse discharge parameters (amplitude, width, frequency), and treatment time will determine the effect on the permeability of the reservoir rock. Fluid mobility is increased due to viscosity reduction and reservoir permeability is increased in the direction of interest from the vibrational removal of particles within pores.

However, in many ecosystems the combination of biological and chemical complexity can preclude a true mechanistic understanding of how microorganisms interact, are affected by viruses, and exchange metabolites. These kinds of insights are critical for our ability to manipulate microbiomes for beneficial outcomes, and better predict how biogeochemical cycles might change under varying environmental conditions. Deep fractured shales host more constrained microbial consortia that are more amenable to interrogation, and offer opportunities for new scientific insights and development of tools that can be applied to increasingly complex systems. Indeed, the investigator has previously revealed that the cycling of methylamines--simple carbon and nitrogen compounds--is a conserved metabolic strategy that fuels methylotrophic methanogenesis in deep shale formations across the Appalachian Basin. Work outlined in this proposal will determine the extent of functional conservation across geographically distinct shales, and use an extensive library of deep biosphere microbial isolates to investigate microbial metabolic interdependencies that enable persistence of life in these extreme environments. The role of viruses in driving microbial community dynamics and metabolite cycling will also be investigated. Finally, novel tools and insights developed in the shale ecosystem will be applied to a more complex wetland system to further illuminate the extent of methylamine metabolism in terrestrial environments. This project will train a graduate student and offer opportunities to undergraduate researchers. The involvement of industrial partners will enable internship placements for graduate students, and contribute to curriculum materials aimed at informing students of diverse career opportunities in subsurface science. Given the level of public interest in hydraulic fracturing and deep biosphere topics, a series of outreach events at local organizations are also planned.<br/><br/>Genome-resolved metagenomic and metabolomic analyses, coupled with laboratory experimentation, has revealed that methylamine cycling in deep terrestrial shales is a conserved functional process across the Appalachian Basin that enables microbial communities to persist for many hundreds of days. Using multiomic approaches, this work will expand investigations into western US shale plays, and determine how functional traits are altered under varying salinity and temperature conditions. Genomic insights into metabolite exchange and methane isotope fractionation in these systems will be tested in the laboratory using environmental isolates and high-pressure incubation apparatus that enables in situ conditions (e.g., pressure, temperature, salinity) to be recreated. Novel analytical tools including high-pressure real-time NMR will be used to track the cycling of substrates at high temporal resolution. The ability of novel and abundant viral populations to mediate carbon and nitrogen cycling in the deep biosphere will also be investigated using a combination of bioinformatic tools and laboratory experimentation. Data resulting from these studies will offer unique insights into the functioning of microbial and viral populations, and the impact of microbial metabolism on poorly-resolved carbon and nitrogen cycles in the deep terrestrial subsurface.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some recent examples include: Dermtreat's nanofibrous Rivelin patch for innovative treatment of mucosal diseases and DuPont's nanofiber-based EnergainT battery separator, which boosts up to 30% power of Li-ion batteries, just to name a few. The global market for nanofibers is expected to reach ~$2 billion by 2021, but its growth potential is hindered by limited ability of sizeable production of nanofibrous materials with predictable complex, macroscopic architectures, and desirable properties.<br/>Undergraduate and graduate trainees with diverse backgrounds from the University of Alabama at Birmingham, University of South Alabama, Troy University, and University of Montevallo will tackle the challenges in the nanofiber science and technology through intense real-life research on fabrication of nanofibers by an uncommon, high-yield alternating-current electrospinning (ACES) process. ACES unveils several new physical phenomena and features that significantly reduce or eliminate many disadvantages of traditional techniques while greatly increasing the productivity and simplifying material handling. All IRES trainees will gain critical international research, industry, and cultural sensitivity experiences expanding beyond each participant?s institution through the collaborative work at a number of high-profile labs and related industries in three European countries, joint presentations/publications, social activities, and interactions with diverse international student population at TUL, UT-Lodz and Aalto. The goals of this project are to accelerate innovation and increase outcomes in the nanofiber materials domain and to develop future leaders and experts capable of operating at a high level of advanced research and competence in global collaboration.<br/><br/>Part 2<br/>This project brings the ongoing collaborations to a higher level and establishes new collaborations in the emerging area of fabrication and application of nanofiber materials and structures with Technical University of Liberec (TUL, Czech Republic, a leading academic center in nanofiber research), Lodz U of Technology (UT-Lodz, Poland, a regional leader in heterogeneous catalysis), and  Aalto University (Finland, the #1 Finnish University with strong idea-to-industry programs in nanoscience and engineering). At least 27 students from the University of Alabama at Birmingham (UAB), University of South Alabama, Troy University, and University of Montevallo will engage in the hands-on pre-trip training at UAB and a 8 week-long cutting-edge research at the forefront of nanofibers science and technology at those premier European institutions, followed by the long-term post trip research and outcomes dissemination activities. <br/>IRES trainees will fabricate nanofibers using a high-yield Alternating Current Electrospinning (ACES) process, which unveils several physical phenomena that significantly reduce or eliminate major disadvantages of traditional DC-techniques, while greatly increasing the productivity. Trainees will apply the fabricated materials to biomedical scaffolds and smart fabrics at TUL, heterogeneous catalysts at UT-Lodz, and novel electrochemical sensors at Aalto. Students will have broad options to immerse in quickly evolving research ecosystem at foreign sites that stimulates breakthroughs and discoveries, as well as multiple opportunities to develop passion for exploration and innovation, and courage to influence and excel. Through the team and individual research projects, professional and soft skills-building exercises, this IRES will: (i) advance the theory and practice of ACES, (ii) help to design a better equipment for sizeable production of nanofiber materials and structures, (iii) develop new nanofiber-based materials and structures with desired properties and performance in controlled and predictable manner, and (iv) foster the training of  globally-engaged experts, visionaries, leaders, and team builders for the fast-growing nanofibers research and manufacturing domain, and for the relevant fields.<br/>IRES trainees will regularly reach out to the public, other college and school kids, e.g., through a new annual IRES student-led Nanomaterials Workshop at TUL, research immersion high school workshop at UAB, and broadcasts by JagTV, USA's student-run TV station.

The proposal will address the critical issue of developing children's identification with science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) fields, and will respond to the existing limited knowledge about the development of STEM identities through conversations, particularly among very young children from underserved and underrepresented populations. The study will be based on the premise that individuals who develop STEM interest and identify with STEM at a young age tend to pursue STEM-related careers more so than individuals who develop these interests later in life. Research on the topic suggests that after exploring a variety of childhood informal STEM learning experiences, such as playing with electronics, taking care of animals, and joining after-school science clubs, talking about science and consuming science-related media were the only predictors of STEM identity. The study will investigate whether STEM-related conversations outside of school with friends and family during formative years (i.e., 5 -9 years old) predict their STEM identity later in life and their STEM-career choices. The goals of the project will be : (1) To develop an understanding of the features and context of conversations that support STEM identity development in both majority and Hispanic/Latino populations; and (2) To translate the research outcomes into informal STEM learning practices that contribute to young people's perceptions of STEM fields in their future.<br/><br/>To achieve the goals, the work will address the following research questions: (1) What is the content, context, and structure of STEM-related conversations with friends and family that youth ages 5-9 participate in?; (2) How do these conversation features (i.e., content, context, structure) relate to the development of youth's STEM interests, sense of recognition as STEM people, and self-identification with STEM?; (3) How do the cultural values and science talk experiences of Hispanic/Latino youth shape conversation features related to youth's STEM interests, sense of recognition as STEM people, and self-identification with STEM in comparison to non-Hispanic/Latino youth?; and (4) Does professional development for informal STEM learning educators that focuses on encouraging youth to engage in STEM-related conversations with friends and family positively contribute to youth's STEM interest, sense of recognition, and self-identification with STEM? To address these questions, the study will adopt a qualitative research approach that applies phenomenological strategies in research design, data collection, and analysis to allow for exploration of the meaning of lived experiences in social and cultural contexts. Participants will include elementary-age students (ages 5-9; n = 50) from socially, culturally, and linguistically diverse backgrounds, enrolled in summer science camps in the greater Miami area that intentionally solicit the participation of children and families who would not typically participate in these kinds of programs due to socioeconomic and cultural barriers. To inform the development of interview protocols in terms of the kinds of childhood talk that leave a long-term impact on students, including the kinds of talk experiences remembered by students who choose or persist towards a STEM career in college; the project will also recruit first- and second-year college students as participants. Data gathering, and interpretation strategies will include surveys with college students (n=32) and interviews (n = 16), as well as recorded and coded semi-structured interviews with early-grade students (n= 50). Broad coding of the content, context, and structure of STEM-related conversations will be further subdivided into sub-codes to identify patterns using qualitative analytical strategies. The outcomes of this research will constitute a theoretical framework and models that can guide the development of both professionals and programmatic activities at informal learning institutions, particularly around scaffolding participation in STEM through science talk. An external evaluator will address both formative and summative aspects of the activity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Throughout its five years, this project will fund scholarships to two groups of seven students who are pursuing bachelor's degrees in biology.  The State of New Hampshire is experiencing rapid growth in STEM jobs. Therefore, growth in the number of students who complete STEM degrees is critical.  This project will provide financial, academic, and social support to help Scholars complete STEM degrees so that they can take advantage of these job opportunities.  Faculty from different STEM disciplines will mentor the Scholars throughout the program, from students' acceptance into the program through graduation. The faculty mentors will coordinate summer quantitative skill building and orientation activities for the Scholars, to reinforce the expectations and value of college education. Then, faculty will conduct weekly study seminars and provide regular advising throughout the students' college career. At early stages, the support activities will introduce the Scholars to a wide range of career and post-graduate opportunities in STEM. As the students advance, the support activities will shift to internships, research, resume writing, and interview strategies, to support career preparation and graduate school acceptance or job placement. The expected outcomes of the project include an assessment of the utility of specific study strategies and learning interventions for STEM students and placement of students into the STEM workforce or graduate school upon completion of their college degree. <br/><br/>The project will support 14 academically high-achieving, lower-income students as they pursue B.S. degrees in Biology at Colby-Sawyer College. By 2020, it is expected that 14% of employment in New Hampshire will be in STEM-related occupations. Yet, New Hampshire ranks last among states in the number of bachelor's degrees awarded in the STEM disciplines. Additionally, students from lower-income areas are known to be more challenging to retain, particularly during the first year of college. This project will recruit academically high-achieving students within that population and help students persist through graduation and on to careers or graduate school in STEM. The project will provide Scholars with scholarships, orientation and community-building activities, quantitative skill building, and study skills training. Faculty mentors will lead the study skills training, instructing students in Successive Relearning, a strategy that combines Distributed Practice and Practice Testing.  Successive relearning has been shown to be an effective study strategy, showing larger learning gains than traditional study strategies. The project will measure its efficacy for improving success and retention of academically-talented students from lower-income areas in a Biology major, thus contributing to knowledge about supporting STEM student success.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As iconicity is prevalent in sign languages, one might think that deaf children would have an advantage in learning new iconic signs. However, this does not appear to be the case, at least for some iconic signs. For example, depicting constructions (DCs) in sign language are iconic, yet children acquire these signs at a prolonged timescale relative to other signs. This research asks why, and thus has implications for early intervention in deaf children with language delays. There is a great need for sign language tests to assess children's sign language knowledge, and this project can inform the development of these tests.<br/><br/>Depicting constructions (DCs) have non-discrete, gradient properties, which may be difficult for children to understand. One hypothesis is that young learners are biased to interpret all movements within a linguistic system as categorical, resulting in difficulty in interpreting gradient mappings in sign, which leads to errors in DCs. Children might not apply this same linguistic bias to non-linguistic stimuli (such as gesture, which has no linguistic categories) and, and if so, should be able to interpret gradience within gesture. The alternative hypothesis is that young learners can interpret gradient mappings in both sign and gesture, but do not know the phonological constraints on forming DCs and thus overuse gradience, which leads to errors in DCs. This research has three aims: (1) examine the types of errors native signing children form when producing DCs; (2) understand how these learners interpret iconic, gradient movements within linguistic (sign) and non-linguistic domains (e.g., gesture); and (3) understand how specific language experiences shape children's assumptions about gesture and sign by testing children exposed to sign language and those not exposed to sign.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These stylistic aspects not only reflect a particular social context, but can also affect how the recipient interprets the message itself.  These relationships are often multifaceted and come with different linguistic expectations.  For example, while parents, professors, and police may all choose the language of authority, in their respective interactions with children, students, and the community, their language reflects a broader set of linguistic expectations in how they relate to others.  This project aims to study social relationships and their effect on language by building new technology that recognizes the linguistic cues of relationships resulting in significant improvements in everyday interactive language technologies such as voice assistants, translation, and summarization and lead to more natural human-machine interactions by improving the ability of machines to understand social aspects of communication that cannot be obtained from the words alone.  This research will also support an interdisciplinary cohort of PhD and undergraduate students and the development of a graduate-level course on Computational Sociolinguistics with open access materials.<br/><br/>This CISE Research Initiation Initiative (CRII) project investigates social relationships and their impact on language by developing new algorithms, methods, and datasets, building upon sociolinguistics theory to create a new framework for studying the interplay of language and relationships in real-world social environments.  This project contains two main phases.  The first phase develops new deep learning methods to accurately infer people's relationship from linguistic cues in their conversation.  To support this effort, it also constructs a new, massive corpus of interpersonal conversations from real-world settings and from fictional settings in movies, television, and literature.  The second phase builds interpretable computational models of communication that explain how a relationship is signaled through linguistic choices in communication, while also disentangling the linguistic influences of the conversational partners' identities.  These models enable testing and extending social science theories about relationship and social organization.  Further, this project also introduces a new natural language understanding task for identifying messages that are offensive only in certain contexts, where the linguistic cues violate social norms for a relationship, helping to further improve technologies to better the public's online experiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Our handheld electronic devices, for example, are made portable by the solid state components that can store energy. Many of the materials in those components are inorganic solids, which can be defined as solid materials that typically contain a wide range of elements including metals combined with nonmetals such as oxygen or metalloids such as silicon. Materials chemists constantly work to arrange the atoms of these solids to optimize their functional properties. Researchers in this field study the fundamental scientific problems that address the relationships between structure, or how those atoms are arranged, and properties such as the ability to store energy. At the 2019 Spring National Meeting of the American Chemical Society, leading experts in the field will hold a symposium to better understand these relationships in the solid state. Hosted by the ACS Division of Inorganic Chemistry, the symposium titled 'Structure-Property Correlations in Functional Inorganic Materials' consists of four half-day sessions that include a mixture of invited and contributed oral presentations. For the invited talks, the symposium brings in fresh, new ideas by inviting scientists early in their career such as faculty at the Assistant Professor level. The symposium also includes a poster session where PhD students and post-doctoral research associates will present their work on these functional materials. Therefore, this symposium, which is supported in part by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in NSF's Division of Materials Research, not only moves this field forward by presenting the latest findings in inorganic solids but also plays a large educational role by integrating young students and post-docs with the larger research community.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>Fundamental to designing and synthesizing new materials is the elucidation of structure-property correlations and relationships in solid state materials. To encourage the exchange of knowledge in this area of research, the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research supports the symposium titled 'Structure-Property Correlations in the Functional Inorganic Materials' at the 2019 Spring National Meeting of the American Society. The symposium includes four half-day oral presentation sessions and one poster presentation session. The topics are divided around five themes based on the invited speakers and contributed talks. These themes include: 1) the synthesis and crystal structure elucidations of new intermetallic phases; 2) chemical properties and structures of quantum materials such as superconductors, magnetic materials, and topological insulators; 3) luminescent and optical properties of novel semiconductors such as the halide-based perovskites; 4) innovative approaches towards solid state synthesis and crystal growth, such as use of the PARADIM user facility; and 5) investigating how various length scales, from the local to average, affect bulk properties in transition metal oxides. The session has a mixture of invited and contributed talks. The majority of the invited talks is given by early-career scientists rather than senior scientists. The former group includes post-doctoral research associates and young faculty. The latter group includes faculty who are current or past editors of relevant journals such as Chemistry of Materials and Science Advances. The contributed only session features several mid-career (post-tenure) scientists and the poster session graduate students in the field. Therefore, the session promises to mix several generations of workers in this field and to present diverse themes in materials and solid state chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Typically, industrial customer spends an average of 16,000 to 26,000 US dollars per patient recruited into a phase I, II or III trial, with phase III recruitment costing the highest. With this project's innovative model assisting virtual clinical trials, the cost of recruitment alone can potentially come down significantly as the costs associated with multiple sites setup and monitoring would be eliminated.

This was apparent as early as the nineteenth century from the extensive interconnectivity of nearby neurons and continues to be apparent from numerous measurements of the tuning curves and correlation of nearby neurons. Despite its fundamental importance, population neural codes are poorly understood. In this project the PI will test a recently developed principle for population code - namely, that neural activity patterns should always be organized into a discrete set of clusters. This organization is appealing, because clusters exhibit error correction, encode qualitatively different stimulus features than their constituent neurons, and can be learned in an unsupervised fashion by downstream neural circuits. Together, these properties enable a powerful form of hierarchical detection of complex stimulus features. The PI aims at developing a principle of population coding that applies widely across the brain. Furthermore, his hypothesis is connected to a model of hierarchical feature detection, which may be operating across all the ascending pathways in the neocortex. In addition, the neocortex's modular structure lends itself to machine learning algorithms. In addition,the project will involve the development and dissemination of software to perform fits of maximum entropy and hidden Markov models to neural data, which could help spur on the research programs of many labs that use these methods to analyze neural populations.<br/><br/>This proposal will combine large-scale neural recording methods from the retina and cortex with state-of-the-art theoretical analyses to study collective phenomena in population neural codes. The PI has an extensive track record in multi-electrode recording from the vertebrate retina, along with applying maximum entropy models to analyze states of network activity. In addition, the PI has recently started a collaboration with Prof. David Tank to record from cortical populations using two-photon calcium fluorescence imaging. The project's aims are: 1. Study how cluster codes can simultaneously encode categorical and continuous stimulus information; if true, this idea would constitute a new example of multiplexed coding in neural populations 2. Study how biologically plausible neural networks can learn and readout clusters; if true, then this makes possible hierarchical cluster processing in the neocortex and will lead us to formulate specific experimental tests to see if layer 4 of V1 is learning LGN clusters. 3. Test whether cluster codes are present in central brain areas, like the visual cortex and hippocampus; this study may generalize his results beyond the retina and help establish a new design principle for population codes.

Increasingly, this process is also argued to involve the prediction of upcoming parts of the sentence. However, open questions remain regarding what type of linguistic information is used in order to generate predictions, and to what extent individuals differ in their ability to engage in prediction. This dissertation research project uses electroencephalography (EEG), a brain-imaging technique with millisecond-level timing resolution, to examine whether the brain utilizes predictive cues to anticipate a complex syntactic structure in Mandarin. This study also examines to what extent the ability to predict complex structures depends on verbal and non-verbal cognitive abilities, providing new insights regarding the neurological basis of language and the cognitive abilities that modulate success in language comprehension.<br/><br/>This project examines what type of linguistic information is used to predict upcoming structure during processing, focusing on the prediction of relative clauses in Mandarin (e.g., the string ""Mary wrote"" in ""the book Mary wrote""). In Mandarin, it is only at the end of the phrase that there is any marker indicating that the words form a relative clause; therefore, predicting relative clauses in advance may be critical for processing these sentences without disruption. This project examines whether tense expressions that appear early in a sentence may provide a predictive cue indicating an upcoming relative clause. Brain activity will be recorded via EEG while participants read sentences in Mandarin, in order to track the dynamics of predictive processing throughout the sentence. Participants will also complete a battery of tests in order to examine whether engaging in structure prediction is modulated by individual differences in linguistic and cognitive abilities, shedding light on the individual properties which may affect language comprehension.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Following established guidelines for developing new psychological measures, the project will begin by interviewing a diverse group of undergraduate student researchers who have experienced negative mentoring.  Analysis of their responses will define a construct of negative mentoring in undergraduate research. A large pool of undergraduate students nationwide will take a draft survey based on this construct.  Results of this survey will provide preliminary insight into the effects of negative mentoring and helping to inform refinements of the survey instruments.

Liquid crystals (LCs) have properties between those of conventional liquids (in that they can flow) and those of solid crystals (in that they are oriented in a very specific way). Liquid crystal displays are widely used - one example is in digital watch faces.  This research seeks to use liquid crystals in capturing light and specifically and uniformly redirecting the light's energy into specific chemical reactions. The project is high risk as such a concept has not yet been demonstrated in practice.  If successful, this research may establish a new paradigm for controlling photochemical reactions so that very specific chemical products are made. This can potentially lead to new environmentally benign chemical processes which rely on light as a source of energy for chemical transformations.  Students participating in this program benefit from multidisciplinary and collaborative training, which allows them to become highly competitive in the technical job market. They also contribute to society through participation in special hands-on activities targeting local K-12 education.<br/><br/>The ultimate goal of this early-stage exploratory program is to develop and experimentally confirm a novel paradigm for controlling the course and selectivity of photochemical reactions through the uniform molecular alignment of photoreactive compounds in liquid crystalline (LC) media and spatially selective excitation of specific electronic transitions with plane-polarized light. In contrast to the conventional ways of controlling photochemical selectivity by imposing geometrical restrictions on the photoreactive molecule, this approach relies on selective excitation of the particular electronic transitions leading to a desired photochemical transformation. The research seeks to design and synthesize a series of photochemically reactive compounds with enhanced ability to align in nematic LC media, which can display excitation-selective photochemical reactivity.  The research group provides detailed experimental analysis and characterization of their LC-imposed alignment and transition dipole moment orientation using UV/vis polarization spectroscopy. This research program may establish a new paradigm for controlling and enhancing selectivity of photochemical reactions. This can potentially lead to new environmentally benign chemical processes which rely on light as a source of energy for chemical transformations.

Hence, their precision, speed and cost are critical to precision engineering applications in the automotive, aerospace and defense industries, and therefore directly impact economic welfare and national security. Stages that use mechanical (i.e., sliding or rolling) bearings are currently the only commercially viable option for a growing number of large-displacement nanopositioning applications. However, mechanical bearing stages suffer from poor precision and low positioning speeds due to the adverse effects of friction. This award supports a scientific investigation into a simple but effective approach for mitigating the effects of pre-motion friction on mechanical bearing stages by connecting the bearing to the stage using a compliant joint. Knowledge created through this investigation will increase the positioning speed and precision of mechanical bearing stages without significantly increasing their cost, hence contributing to the commercial viability of nanotech processes. Its broader impact plan includes: (i) collaborations with Aerotech, Inc., a U.S.-based nanopositioning stage manufacturer, to facilitate knowledge and technology transfer; (ii) educational curriculum development at two universities and training of professional engineers through tutorials offered by the American Society for Precision Engineering; and (iii) outreach to underrepresented minority middle school students, aimed at inspiring and equipping the next generation of highly-skilled manufacturing engineers. <br/><br/>The objective of this research is to gain a fundamental understanding of the dynamics and compensation of nonlinear pre-motion friction acting on a servo-controlled mass through a friction isolator. Empirical studies have demonstrated significant improvements in positioning precision and speed when a servo-controlled mass (e.g., a nanopositioning stage) interacts with nonlinear pre-motion friction through a friction isolator (i.e., a compliant joint). However, very little is known about the dynamics of the friction isolator. The premise of this research is that, under certain circumstances, harmful dynamic phenomena (e.g., limit cycles) could occur when pre-motion friction acts on a servo-controlled mass through a friction isolator. This premise will be tested scientifically, to discover the harmful phenomena and circumstances that give rise to them, leading to insights on how to avoid them. To achieve this goal, mathematical characterizations of interactions between friction, friction isolator and servo parameters (e.g., mass, stiffness and damping) will be made using various tools, like the method of multiple scales, from nonlinear dynamic analysis. This will be complemented by rigorous numerical and physical experimentation on mechanical bearing nanopositioning stages, to guide, validate or refine the mathematical characterizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One key to their utility is that programmers can quickly develop algorithms to solve new problems as by using well-understood mathematical abstractions of the underlying computational machinery. Ideally, modern robots should behave in the same way. They should perform useful tasks for people, and they should be easy to program so that roboticists can quickly adapt them to solve new problems as they arise. However, in practice, the process of developing robots is much more convoluted when they operate in unstructured, i.e., real-world, environments and requires iterative adjustments of the robot and its programming. The problem is that physical interaction is difficult to model, so that a robot action can inadvertently change the state of the world, sometimes directly causing accidents or causing problems in future robot-world interactions. This project addresses this problem in the context of robot construction by developing representations of the world state that robots can reason about and use for planning. These allow programmers to treat robots and embodied algorithms and to make robots that reliably operate when modifying the environment and building structures. This algorithmic view of robot-environment interaction is one approach to accomplishing the urgent societal need for innovative construction techniques that are adaptable and scalable and will help humans adapt to changing societal and infrastructure needs. <br/><br/>This project develops abstraction barriers with di&#64256;erent amounts of physical detail, which can be combined to produce robots that reliably work in highly unstructured environments.

While this market size currently represents displays that employ rigid LCD or OLED technologies, major handset manufacturers are looking to move to highly differentiated form-factors such as foldable phones to gain market share in the competitive flagship smartphone tier. To do so, the entire display module must be foldable and one of the last components to allow for this behavior is the cover lens. Foldable displays therefore must eliminate hard, brittle materials such as glass and utilize materials with the same excellent scratch-resistant properties of glass, but with the flexibility and durability under folding of polymers. This project develops a novel polysulfide thermoset for this application.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project aims to develop the first low-cost, high-performance foldable cover lens technology using polysulfide thermosetting polymer films. Currently, the amorphous polysulfide thermosets can yield the excellent optical properties and folding durability required for application in foldable display technologies. However, these materials are as of yet unable to meet the strict hardness requirement set by manufacturers looking to replace rigid glass cover lenses. In this work, the expansion of the polysulfide thermoset family of materials will be undertaken to introduce chemical and physical modifications which allow for the resultant thermosetting films to possess the requisite hardness. The resultant resin materials will then be converted using standard wet-film extrusion and curing tools commonly found in the printing industry, allowing for cost-competitive production of the resulting films.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dramatic turns of events are key to recognizing and communicating effective reports or stories about events.  Autonomous systems will work more effectively with humans in obtaining and conveying such narrative when they too can recognize what is dramatic (or tragic, or comical) about human events.  The challenge is to effectively convey such concepts to a computer in such a way that humans and autonomous systems can effectively work together in this. This research studies how to direct a team of robots to obtain video footage to produce clips that trace a dramatic story arc. It is an examination of how such systems might achieve goals that people consider to be abstract or high-level. Within this project, the programs that command teams of robots must predict likely events, direct the robots to be in position for obtaining the desired footage, and re-plan based on observed events. This challenge encompasses a rich and previously unstudied class of problems for robot systems.  It will constitute a unique demonstration of robots that are capable of achieving high-level goals as they process data in forms which combine both continuous and discrete views of the world in a new and unusual way.  More broadly, the research will advance how computers can fuse and summarize video streams. Both skills are needed for automatically generating synopses and in editing videos. Obvious places where this is useful include helping secure the nation (for surveillance), taming the deluge of online multimedia content (for summarization), and advancing applications in the creative industries (for editing). The research project will also use the ideas underlying these pieces in a new robotics course with students at three institutions going head-to-head in a series of competition-based class projects. This course (taught, among other places, at a Hispanic-Serving Institution) will contribute to the development of the STEM workforce of the future, helping increase American competitiveness.<br/><br/>The project advances current knowledge by formulating new theory and developing novel algorithms for autonomous and robot systems, with a focus on those systems with minimal or no human operator intervention. The research contributes novel data representations for robots that will inhabit rich environments such as those characterized by uncertain, unanticipated, and dynamically changing circumstances. One of the foundational ideas of the project is a means to specify sophisticated mission objectives via a recursive structure using prior work in compiler theory for computer languages.

The vast number of studies on AV hinge upon assumptions on how AVs behave with respect to other vehicles.  Unfortunately, few of the assumptions can be empirically validated due to the absence of AVs. And yet, a critical component of AV technologies, the adaptive cruise control (ACC), has been used for over a decade and can be used to fill this gap.  The research aims to study how vehicles with ACC behave when interacting with other vehicles on the road. The research will provide important insights on the behaviors of AVs in the future. The understandings gained from this research will also have important implications in traffic management, transportation planning, and design of ACC vehicles and AV.  Additionally, this project will engage in a range of integrated research, educational and outreach activities, including sharing the ACC data with the research and practice community, developing educational modules, and K-12 outreach through summer camp. <br/><br/>More specifically, the research will (i) collect empirical trajectory data of ACC vehicles of different car-makers and their counterparts, regular vehicles (RVs), and (ii) formulate car-following models that capture the similar and differentiating features of ACCs and RVs.  The project will focus on data collection and model estimation efforts using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). This enables the novel applications of statistical inference methods (e.g., the likelihood ratio test) to test various hypotheses to assess the differences and similarities among different ACC systems and between ACCs and RVs. In particular, the research will test if ACC systems from different car-makers differ from one another and from the RVs, and if they change substantially over time. Knowing this is important because it will dictate whether or not future research in this area has to focus on analyzing each individual carmaker, or if ACC systems will eventually converge towards human-like driving.   In the modeling efforts, the research will build a general stochastic model so that the behaviors of ACC vehicles and RVs can be reconciled.  The research will examine different variations of the distributions of the model components to specify the model(s) and use MLE for estimation of model parameters.

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. Using this methodology and via an international coalition of investigators from the US and four other countries in the Northern Hemisphere, this research involves integrating the economic, social, and natural sciences in a comprehensive framework to examine the consequences of human activities in coastal settings on terrestrial and nearshore marine water quality and coastal marine biodiversity. Such input is critical to ecosystem health and human well-being because many of our coastal fisheries, recreational activities, and nearshore marine ecosystems depend on the quality of freshwater that flows from the land to the sea. The US component of this international research consortium develops the economic/valuation component of the larger, coupled, modeling system that will be used to examine how changes in freshwater flows and water quality in coastal systems impact fisheries and fishing communities.  The Estuary and Northern Gulf of St. Lawrence in Canada serve as case studies. Collaborators from outside the US and their parts of the project are funded through their associated national funding agencies.  Project objectives are aligned with work of the Intergovernmental Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services. This entity encourages the integration of economic, social, and natural sciences to understand the complexities and linkages of human impacts on ecosystems. In addition to the valuation module, the US research team will help develop the decision support framework that can be used to inform policy and ecosystem service choices for coastal regions. Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration, between the US and Germany, Ireland, Sweden, and Canada. The research also has potential health implications for coastal populations and communities increasingly impacted by deterioration in freshwater sources, water quality, and loss of coastal marine biodiversity as a result of increases in coastal population pressure and habitation in a world subjected to rising sea level, increasing temperatures, and evaporation resulting from global warming. Study results will be useful to policy makers and resource managers of marine-freshwater ecosystems, with the modeling component providing useful input on possible coastal adaption strategies to climate change. Additional impacts include use of multiple communications platforms to reach out to stakeholders, the public, and policy makers to maximize utilization of and provide broad accessibility to research results. The Project also provides valuable student training in terms of becoming international scholars.<br/><br/>This award supports U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contributed to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models to improve data accessibility and fill gaps in knowledge. Using this methodology, a five-party, international, collaborative research project, in which investigators from the US are involved, focuses on developing an integrated framework of coupled models for predicting the immediate and long-term consequences of land-use and climate change on water quality, biodiversity, and ecosystems processes related to freshwater (surface and groundwater) and nearshore marine ecosystems. The process starts with engaging a broad spectrum of stakeholders to co-design scenarios of human and global change-associated pressures on terrestrial freshwater and marine ecosystems. From this input, conceptual models and mechanistic frameworks that can explore the impacts of multiple terrestrially-derived pressures on freshwater and marine biodiversity and ecosystem processes can be constructed and coded. The work of the US team focuses on providing modules to determine economic and other impacts, as a function of one or more stressors, on habitat and with regard to regulatory functions (e.g., changes in freshwater flows or/and quality/health of coastal systems). The US contribution will also provide critical input into the decision support component of the project. Overall project goals are to create effective and realistic decision support tools from which recommendations can be made that can be used by policy and decision makers, land use and resource managers, urban planners, and those examining possible mitigation and/or adaptation strategies to global change impacts in coastal areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More than 60 million people worldwide suffer from epilepsy, a debilitating, unpredictable chronic condition.  To reduce the risk of injury or death, neurologists frequently recommend caregivers constantly monitor patients, resulting in co-sleeping, significant changes in work and family schedules, and a substantial loss of independence. However, even under monitored conditions, caregivers fail to recognize more than 50% of seizures, resulting in sub-optimal treatment. Although technology is available to detect seizures in clinical settings, the necessary equipment is not currently suitable for continuous use in daily living.  The development and validation of technology to detect and alert patients and caregivers to all types of seizures in a non-clinical setting would have substantial benefits for timely treatment, improve patient outcomes, and improve patient and caregiver quality of life.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project further develops a core technology that uses analysis of eye movements to provide a reliable, reproducible means of identifying seizure activity.

Hence, their precision, speed and cost are critical to precision engineering applications in the automotive, aerospace and defense industries, and therefore directly impact economic welfare and national security. Stages that use mechanical (i.e., sliding or rolling) bearings are currently the only commercially viable option for a growing number of large-displacement nanopositioning applications. However, mechanical bearing stages suffer from poor precision and low positioning speeds due to the adverse effects of friction. This award supports a scientific investigation into a simple but effective approach for mitigating the effects of pre-motion friction on mechanical bearing stages by connecting the bearing to the stage using a compliant joint. Knowledge created through this investigation will increase the positioning speed and precision of mechanical bearing stages without significantly increasing their cost, hence contributing to the commercial viability of nanotech processes. Its broader impact plan includes: (i) collaborations with Aerotech, Inc., a U.S.-based nanopositioning stage manufacturer, to facilitate knowledge and technology transfer; (ii) educational curriculum development at two universities and training of professional engineers through tutorials offered by the American Society for Precision Engineering; and (iii) outreach to underrepresented minority middle school students, aimed at inspiring and equipping the next generation of highly-skilled manufacturing engineers.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to gain a fundamental understanding of the dynamics and compensation of nonlinear pre-motion friction acting on a servo-controlled mass through a friction isolator. Empirical studies have demonstrated significant improvements in positioning precision and speed when a servo-controlled mass (e.g., a nanopositioning stage) interacts with nonlinear pre-motion friction through a friction isolator (i.e., a compliant joint).  However, very little is known about the dynamics of the friction isolator. The premise of this research is that, under certain circumstances, harmful dynamic phenomena (e.g., limit cycles) could occur when pre-motion friction acts on a servo-controlled mass through a friction isolator. This premise will be tested scientifically, to discover the harmful phenomena and circumstances that give rise to them, leading to insights on how to avoid them. To achieve this goal, mathematical characterizations of interactions between friction, friction isolator and servo parameters (e.g., mass, stiffness and damping) will be made using various tools, like the method of multiple scales, from nonlinear dynamic analysis. This will be complemented by rigorous numerical and physical experimentation on mechanical bearing nanopositioning stages, to guide, validate or refine the mathematical characterizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Addressing these human-environment interactions is particularly important for tropical forest ecosystems as they contain approximately half of all living species, play an important role in climate regulation, and filter pollutants from water and air. Despite their importance, current policies are still largely ineffective as indicated by continued significant tropical forest loss over the past several decades. This NSF International Research Experience for Students award will support U.S. student projects across forests in Panama, Costa Rica, and Uganda to analyze how international variation in environmental policies influences land use practices and how these practices affect conservation outcomes related to forest condition and primate biology. By examining similar forests with different environmental policies and different forests with similar environmental policies, we will be able to evaluate the largescale effectiveness of conservation incentives, such as payments for ecosystem services (PES) and ecotourism, alongside the effects of agricultural practices linked to deforestation, air and water pollution, and biodiversity loss. Through this research program, underrepresented students in anthropology, human biology, and the environmental sciences will gain international field research experience in collaboration with the Organization for Tropical Studies and Makerere University Biological Field Station. Students will work closely with local field assistants and communities during their research, thus providing multiple opportunities for cultural exchange. At the end of the 10-week program, students will present their initial results to local communities and host country scholars at a public forum and will be encouraged to communicate their final results through peer-reviewed publication and presentations at professional conferences. An additional end product associated with this program and utilized by the IRES students will be a fully functioning laboratory capable of running immunoassays for quantifying primate hormone levels in the field, thus transferring scientific knowledge and infrastructure. Results from this research program will provide important insight useful to the design of policies for sustaining both biodiversity and human livelihoods. <br/><br/>Tropical forests are one of the world's most important ecosystems, containing at least half of all species, regulating climate, purifying air and water, and providing resources for local communities. Nonetheless, over the past few decades widespread deforestation has significantly reduced the extent of tropical forests, leading to declines in wildlife populations that depend on them through habitat loss and fragmentation. Primate populations have been especially affected with more than 60% of all species considered vulnerable or endangered by the IUCN. Efforts to preserve the remaining forests and threatened species dependent on them have largely focused on creating protected areas, such as national parks. However, citizens often rely heavily on natural resources for subsistence and environmental laws are regularly breached, thus weakening the effectiveness of protected areas. As a result, conservation policies have evolved from exclusionary protected areas to strategies that focus on local communities by providing economic and other incentives. Despite the increasing promotion of community-based alternatives by both scholars and practitioners, little evidence exists that they are any more effective than protected areas at maintaining forest quality or sustaining primate populations. Therefore, this NSF IRES research program has two main objectives: 1) To utilize international variation in environmental policies that integrate conservation and development objectives, such as payments for ecosystem services (PES) and ecotourism, for an analysis of the effectiveness of conservation strategies for both protecting tropical forests and their primates and maintaining human livelihoods; and 2) To provide international field research experience to underrepresented students in anthropology, human biology, and the environmental sciences. To meet these objectives, 15 upper level undergraduate and early career graduate student projects will examine the extent to which differing economic and participatory incentives and agricultural practices influence conservation outcomes as measured by on the ground data collected on forest condition (e.g., fragment size, % canopy cover, biomass) and primate biology (i.e., physiology, behavior, and population size) across forests in Panama, Costa Rica, and Uganda. At these sites, students will survey primate populations using line transects, quantify differences in primate behavior, measure primate fecal hormone levels with immunoassays, conduct interviews and surveys of local landowners, government officials and other stakeholders, and quantify forest characteristics using GIS and field methods. Students will also examine the effects of these strategies on local community livelihoods and how these effects influence local perception of environmental policy. Results from this project will add significantly to the knowledge of how economic and participatory incentives can affect conservation decisions and outcomes. As a breakdown in socio-environmental systems will negatively affect both humans and biodiversity, quantifying the effectiveness of various environmental management strategies to maintain biodiversity and local community livelihoods is necessary to ensure that these policies are actually meeting their sustainability and conservation goals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will create unique linkages to East African organizations that will train, educate and professionally develop 17 STEM student research scientists over three years focused on disaster resilience, displacement and GIS. The project will broaden participation of underrepresented groups as we will fully leverage RIT's existing underrepresented recruitments networks such as RIT's large Deaf-and-Hard of Hearing population, women, and minorities. The MCC student will create a unique opportunity for undergraduate international research experience as well as community college international research capacity development. Displaced people in Rwanda will also benefit through their participation as field research assistants as well as the research providing outreach and advocacy for their situations. Intellectual products created by IRES students, such as community-scale resilience maps displacement resilience indexes will provide important benefits to society that can bring global attention to displacement and disaster resilience research and GIS. The project is particularly strong in enhancing infrastructure for research and education as IRES students will become part of Rwandan and East African research networks only available by being on-site in Rwanda. CGIS and MIDIMAR for the first time become linked to NSF research. Workshops on disasters and resilience GIS mapping will be conducted by IRES students with Rwandan secondary schools and disaster stakeholder groups for broader project outreach. If successful, findings will be generalizable for additional internationally-focused research beyond displaced population natural disaster resilience in Rwanda (for example, the Syrian and Rohingya refugee crises) and particularly US-national interest disaster resilience and displacement issues like seen in hurricanes Harvey and Maria, creating the potential for broader US-national and international research on displaced population natural disaster resilience that can provide future students with the knowledge, motivation and inspiration to pursue internationally-focused science careers to solve US-national and global challenges.<br/><br/>The primary student research project goal is community-level scale field mapping with Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and remote sensing of resilience indicators relevant to displaced population natural disaster resilience. Data collected by IRES students will be used as an input for spatially modeling, indexing and quantifying the natural disaster resilience of displaced people. The research team will create transformative knowledge on understanding the relationship between displacement and natural disaster resilience. Spatial indexes of displaced population natural disaster resilience currently do not exist at any scale -  let alone at the community-level scale that will only be possible to investigate through the foreign research site. Student research efforts will make valuable intellectual contributions to understanding (a) the spatial relationships between displacement and disaster resilience, (b) how developing displacement disaster resilience spatial metrics can inform displacement planning, and (c) how resilience is developed and manifested in displacement and disaster contexts to inform disaster management decision making and risk-reduction. Rwanda is a unique location for research on mapping and quantifying displaced population natural disaster resilience due to both refugee populations and internally displaced Rwandan citizens who face natural disaster risks. Access to these diverse and unique groups is only possible by being in Rwanda.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The earthquake took place in the upper part of a subducting slab where the slab may be bending downwards, and early indications suggest that the event was related to stresses caused by plate bending.  In the weeks and months following a large earthquake, slip and deformation can continue to take place along a tectonic plate boundary.  To better understand that nature of this deformation, this study would place five continuous GPS (global positioning system) stations near the earthquake epicenter, as well as record campaign GPS measurements at other local benchmark locations.  Data from this study could be used to better understand the behavior along the Denali fault and improve constraints on local seismic hazards.  <br/><br/>This project focuses on constraining postseismic deformation due to the magnitude 7 Anchorage earthquake, a normal faulting event within the Yakutat flat slab, including how coseismic and postseismic deformation may trigger changes in slip along the subduction interface. To achieve this, five new continuous GPS sites will be installed in the near-field of the earthquake and repeat campaign surveys will be conducted at benchmarks throughout the region. These measurements will provide a dataset that will be able to more completely characterize postseismic deformation, variations in locking and creeping behavior on the subduction interface, and potential triggered slow slip events.  The effect of intraslab normal-faulting earthquakes on upper plate deformation, coupling along the subduction interface, and transient events on the interface is not well understood.   Coseismic displacements recorded at continuous GPS sites show a complex deformation pattern and the location of the event make it likely that viscoelastic relaxation in the asthenosphere will occur.  Aftershocks recorded in the first weeks after the earthquake roughly delineate a horizontal surface, suggesting that the events may be occurring at or near the plate interface. The main shock occurred within a region that has experienced multi-year slow slip events in the past and studies in other subduction zones suggest that such regions are more prone to triggered slow-slip events after an earthquake. Along the eastern limit of the Yakutat flat slab, a postseismic study of the 2002 Denali earthquake suggested that that event may have caused long-term changes of the coupling along that section of the subduction interface. The sparseness of GPS sites within the aftershock zone makes it likely that transient changes on the underlying interface may go undetected and that postseismic deformation and changes in the coupling along the interface may not be able to be fully characterized. Data collected from the proposed new network of continuous GPS added to the data from existing continuous GPS and repeat surveys at campaign benchmarks will allow an evaluation of these signals at a more temporally and spatially dense scale than is currently possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coupled natural-human systems; improved scenarios of biodiversity; and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of both direct and indirect drivers such as land use change, invasive alien species, overexploitation, environmental change, pollution, and models of impacts of these drivers on biodiversity and ecosystem service are needed to overcome these challenges.  These holistic approaches provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments and environmental co-benefits of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This research builds on such methodology to examine changes in Arctic ecosystems that are currently experiencing dramatic change with immediate impacts on ecosystem services involving food production, climate regulation, natural resources, and cultural integrity. This research will integrate indigenous knowledge and cutting-edge scientific approaches to develop long-term profiles of changes in the distribution and abundance of key Arctic species over time. Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration between Norway, Sweden, Finland, France, Germany, Canada, and Denmark as well as UNESCO.  This large international collaboration will help build bridges between countries and communities with interests in the Arctic; engage stakeholders ranging from local communities to national environmental protection agencies, including indigenous peoples; and develop a far-reaching and rich, public data resource on Arctic systems that will be available to natural and social scientists across countries and disciplines. In addition to the development of new processes that will allow the recovery of ancient DNA from sediments and their integration with other data types, this project will develop ecological forecasting models that incorporate how the diversity of organisms in the Arctic has changed in the past and is likely to change in the future. Additional impacts include the integration of science and education and training students to be the next generation of international scholars. <br/><br/>This award supports U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet.  The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance and to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility, and fill gaps in knowledge. Funds support U.S. participants in a large international consortium that will develop ecological forecasting models that incorporate chemical, physical, and multi-taxa ecological data. The models will include input from a broad spectrum of stakeholders, including indigenous peoples. Goals of this project are to dramatically improve understanding how the diversity of organisms in the Arctic has changed over time and is likely to change in the future.  Participants in this effort from other countries are funded through their associated national funding organizations. The U.S. component of the work will generate records of the changing distribution and abundance of plants and animals across the Late Pleistocene and Holocene by isolating environmental DNA from long sediment cores collected from lakes across the circumpolar North. These data will be combined with that from international collaborators about changes in the distribution and abundance of species over time taken from records from local communities and indigenous peoples extending back generations. The full suite of information will be used to address: how the diversity of living organisms has changed over time at different locations in the Arctic; determine how different these changes have been across space and time; tease out what the ecological and anthropogenic drivers appear to be in changes in Arctic biodiversity; and figure out how to combine quantitative ecosystems measurements with anecdotal and recorded accounts from local communities who interact with the vegetation, climate, herbivory, and other anthropogenic influences. With this information, model-generated scenarios will be created that support sustainable ecosystem management in the face of accelerating socio-ecological transformations occurring throughout the circumpolar North.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, this project will reduce the labor and cost associated with treating and preventing ulcers. Pressure ulcers are serious injuries that afflict those who are may already be suffering from other ailments such as paralysis and diabetes. They are often overlooked until it is too late, posing serious morbidity and mortality risk. Pressure ulcer prevention is a continuous job, and treatment of established ulcers is costly. Caretakers must constantly check, adjust, and turn at-risk wheelchair bound patients for the duration of the day. This is even more problematic with the nationwide staffing shortage in nursing homes. The most effective available cushions are cost prohibitive for most at-risk individuals and care facilities. Moreover, cushions that are widely used are prone to breaking, resulting in reoccurring costs and the need to reestablish constant care. Aside from the facilities and individuals who are affected, insurance companies in the US spend over $11 billion in treatment of ulcers every year and ulcers are the 2nd largest cause of medical malpractice lawsuits in the US.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will develop a new wheelchair cushion that can minimize pressure ulcer onset. Prolonged sitting can lead to extreme discomfort, the breakdown of skin tissue, and the development of pressure ulcers. Strategies to mitigate this issue are based primarily on the principles of immersion and offloading. Immersion is the process of distributing interfacial pressure evenly across a surface. This is normally achieved with a foam or air cushion. Offloading is the process of suspending a specific region of the body in the air to remove and or redistribute pressure. To date, traditional strategies are ineffective in managing pressure ulcers. Immersion techniques can only reduce pressure magnitudes. Offloading cushions result in increased pressure and risk of pressure ulcer formation at support sites. This project develops a cushion that utilizes targeted offloading of high-risk areas to remove pressure alongside cyclic alternating pressure to prevent prolonged tissue deformation in non-offloaded sites. Furthermore, the rechargeable battery powered cushion is compact and quiet, so it does not interfere with a user's daily life.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mobility is associated with functional independence and participation in society. Sufficient ankle control plays a vital role in mobility. A significant portion of populations with neuromuscular disorders, such as children with cerebral palsy (CP) and post-stroke survivals, live with insufficient ankle control. Our design, DEAFO, is a soft mechanized brace to help these individuals to walk easier and longer. DEAFO will provide assistance and correction about the ankle while preventing discomfort, to promote mobility and improve the quality of life of the users.  The project will first focus on the CP population (~700,000 in US), which is the most common motor disorder in children. CP's total economic burden, in direct and indirect costs, is $11.5 billion per year, in the US alone. A significant portion of this cost consists of assistive devices and physical training, needed due to insufficient ankle control. Hence, DEAFO will aim to provide both ankle assistance and physical training to promote motor recovery, which potentially decreases these costs over time. The company's ultimate goal is to expand DEAFO applications to post-stroke population (~8 million in US). <br/><br/>This I-Corps project will be the first light-weight, noiseless, soft, and mechanized ankle foot orthoses (AFO), that deploy dielectric elastomer (DE)-based artificial muscle. Thus, it is called DEAFO. Increased chance of falls, and inefficient walking speed, are major consequences of ankle-control deficit. Although this is a common disorder in a population of 8 to 10 million, the status of care for this pathology, usually, is a rudimentary, bulky, rigid uncomfortable AFO. Furthermore, the none-mechanized AFOs hold the ankle fixed at specific angles, and cause secondary problems, such as disuse atrophy of the muscles. DEAFO will be mechanized by dielectric elastomer (DE)-based artificial muscle. The novel DE actuators are soft, lightweight, compact, and acoustically noiseless, with muscle-like behaviors, which is benchmark tested in the company's lab. The softness and noiseless operation of these artificial muscles will substantially improve the comfort and natural feel of the device in comparison with other mechanized AFOs. Unlike most mechanized AFOs, the controller that will drive the artificial muscles in the device has been specifically developed and evaluated for pathological walking and showed 100% detection reliability in children with CP. This project can revolutionize the status of care for ankle-control deficit.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most of the damage and fatalities were caused by violent tornadoes spawned by supercell thunderstorms, with six tornadoes receiving EF5 rankings, the most violent category of the Enhanced Fujita scale.  Last year, several outbreaks occurred with over 140 confirmed tornadoes rated between EF2 and EF4 that resulted in substantial damage and over 30 deaths. While significant advances in our knowledge of supercell thunderstorms and tornadoes have occurred in recent decades, understanding of the fundamental processes occurring within supercells that result in tornadoes remains elusive. This void in knowledge is especially concerning for violent tornadoes that are responsible for a disproportionate number of fatalities and injuries as well as damage. Until these tornado genesis and maintenance processes are understood, our ability to forecast such events is severely limited. The primary goal of this research is to improve the fundamental understanding of processes underlying the formation and maintenance of tornadoes in supercell thunderstorms, especially as these processes relate to violent tornadoes. This knowledge is critical for improving tornado forecasts, tornado warning lead times, and estimations of potential tornado strength and longevity, and is especially applicable to tornadoes of strong and violent intensity. In conjunction with an awarded NSF grant providing continued access to the NSF-funded Blue Waters supercomputer, the research will analyze petabytes of data to study the processes occurring in supercells that result in tornadoes of varying strength, longevity, and structure.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Despite advances in observational and modeling/computing technology, much still needs to be understood about the evolution of tornadoes. Few computer simulations exist in which a well-resolved tornado forms within its parent supercell, and this work uses the highest resolution simulations of violently tornadic supercells conducted to date. A control simulation with 30 meter grid spacing has been completed where twenty fields in a volume centered on the tornado during its entire life cycle have been saved to disk every model time step, which will facilitate the most accurate analysis possible. 20 m and 15 m simulations containing long-track EF5 tornadoes have also been completed, and additional runs at these resolutions will be executed as needed. Tools to efficiently interrogate and analyze model data saved every time step will be improved and new tools will be developed. New simulations will be conducted in other environments in which violent tornadoes were observed. By analyzing simulated storms in different environments and comparing tornadogenesis failure cases to cases where violent tornadoes occur, the research team aims to identify processes common within unusually violent supercells involved in the formation and maintenance of tornadoes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>A better fundamental understanding of tornado development in supercell thunderstorms should help guide future field programs in which new features identified in these numerical simulations are targeted for study, and ultimately lead to improvements in our ability to accurately forecast significant tornadic events and increase tornado warning lead times. Improving our fundamental understanding of tornado maintenance, made possible through analysis of the simulations described, should provide insight critical for National Weather Service forecasters to better predict, once a tornado has developed, how long a particular tornado may last. This type of information is invaluable, especially when pertaining to high-end, long-track events. The improved understanding of tornadoes in addition to cutting-edge visualizations of this research will facilitate science education in forums ranging from formal courses for students to learning venues for the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Populations in higher latitudes are more likely to have vitamin D deficiencies due to lack of sun exposure; however, recent research indicates that vitamin D deficiency has become a global phenomenon, even in countries near the equator, with women often experiencing more severe deficiency. This doctoral dissertation project applies a biocultural perspective on vitamin D production from infancy through young adulthood to investigate how societal practices and norms create and dictate the physical environments that individuals experience. By using a longitudinal data set, the study delves deeper into the possible factors that contribute to vitamin D deficiency in both men and women, and for societies undergoing urbanization. The project not only addresses the complex interplay of human biology and culture, but also has the potential to inform public health efforts to understand and address vitamin D deficiency.  <br/><br/>Biological anthropology has elaborated the tradeoffs between the need for vitamin D production and the need to avoid damage from the harmful effects of exposure to ultraviolet rays, but unanswered questions remain regarding how vitamin D is regulated and why some individuals are at risk for vitamin D deficiency.  The primary focus has been on sun exposure, but other aspects of the current environment, and aspects of the environment experienced early in life, may be equally important.  This study will use longitudinal data collected from the Cebu Longitudinal Health and Nutrition Survey in the Philippines to assess the effects of rapid urbanization and socioeconomic change on vitamin D production in young adulthood.  A range of environmental factors early in development, and in adulthood, will be tested as predictors of circulating vitamin D.  Furthermore, DNA methylation - an epigenetic process that is associated with gene expression - will be measured at sites in genes associated with vitamin D production.  DNA methylation is a plausible mechanism through which environments during development can regulate genome activity in adulthood, and the study will investigate the association between environments in childhood, DNA methylation of vitamin D genes, and vitamin D production in adulthood. The use of a biocultural anthropological approach allows for an exploration of how lived experience affects vitamin D production and well-being over the life course.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, the sophisticated array of sensors combines several earth science techniques in a single instrument making the MSCL a valuable tool for STEM educational outreach and training.<br/><br/>The multi-sensor core logger (MSCL) funded by this grant to Syracuse University from the National Science Foundation includes the following components: 1) the MSCL-S base system with computer and software, 2) an acoustic P-wave system for measuring sound-wave propagation, 3) a gamma-density measurement system,  4) a magnetic susceptibility system for whole and split cores, 5) a color-spectroscopy system (wavelengths 360-740 nm) for quantifying color and lithology, and 6) a line-scan camera for high-resolution core photos. The integrated MSCL-S system will be used in the research of several faculty members in the Department of Earth Science at Syracuse University with expertise in paleoenvironmental reconstructions using core materials. Faculty research in the department that will be supported by this instrument include using color spectroscopy and lithological changes in lake-sediments to investigate tropical drought and ocean-atmosphere linkages during the Cenozoic, as well as Arctic climate and permafrost dynamics over the late Quaternary. Researchers studying basin evolution over a range of geologic timescales will use the combination of gamma and p-wave sensors on the MSCL-S to create ?synthetic seismograms?, which allow for precise calibration of core material to basin-wide seismic reflection data. Ongoing departmental research using a combination of anoxic lake sediments and geologic samples to explore global carbon cycle and ocean anoxic events will also benefit from access to the suite of sensors on this instrument.

Despite these broad societal implications, the mechanisms driving the deep warming are still poorly understood. This project aims to improve our understanding of these mechanisms through a global study using a new method to utilize chemical tracers (in this case chlorofluorocarbons; CFCs) to overcome previous obstacles due to limitations from sparse data. The analysis will capitalize on a growing data set of detectable CFC concentrations throughout the deep ocean as anthropogenic tracers enter and circulate along the bottom limb of the overturning circulation of the ocean. This data set allows for both defining new pathways that bring new waters into the deep ocean and assessment of the variability in deep water formation rates. The variability will allow for correlations with surface conditions to evaluate driving mechanisms so that they can be included in climate models. In addition, this work will update decadal trends in abyssal warming, anthropogenic carbon uptake, and deep steric sea level rise annually through the end of the project in 2021. The results  will help to close current global energy, carbon, and sea level budgets and advance our understanding of the physical mechanisms forcing the distribution of anthropogenic heat and carbon throughout the ocean. This work will demonstrate and explain modes of deep variability previously unknown for use in climate models leading to improved long-term climate projections under increased CO2 emissions, therefore enabling better societal adaptability to changes to come. The project will support a third year graduate student for his PhD work at SIO. In addition, smaller summer projects will be made available for undergraduate summer students through the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Undergraduates Research Fellowship (SURF) program. The project will produce gridded global CFC, deep ocean warming, and steric sea level rise data products that will be made available to the broader scientific and educational communities.<br/><br/>The overall objective of this proposal is to understand the variability in the bottom limb of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) in order to quantify, explain, and forecast the role that the deep ocean plays in ocean heat and carbon uptake. The deep ocean is warming at a significant rate with important climatic implications for sea level rise and ocean heat absorption.  Despite these broad societal implications, the mechanism driving this deep warming is still poorly understood and difficult to simulate in climate models, decreasing our ability to predict how the climate will change under increased CO2 emissions . One hypothesis is the warming is driven by a decrease in deep water formation around Antarctica.  The deep CFC data will be used to produce annual gridded maps within neutral density surfaces around the globe by modeling the oceanic subsurface response and fitting the data within its uncertainty. The gridded CFC dataset will allow for inference of deep circulation, ventilation, and assessment of any interdecadal change in locations with multiple decades of data. It will validate any observed interdecadal variability by comparing to changes in tracer age, oxygen, and volume of deep water along repeated hydrographic sections. The decadal variability will be compared to observed deep warming trends in order to identify if these changes are causing the recent accumulation of heat in the abyssal ocean and explore any mechanisms driving the variability.  This work will allow better characterization of the mean and variability of the deep transport along the bottom limb of the MOC and how it has affected deep-ocean temperatures. The new method to find tracer transport from CFCs to provide an improved estimate of deep ocean circulation, ventilation, and variability will also lay the groundwork for future monitoring of global deep-ocean warming.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Randomness arises naturally in many applications ranging from economics, operational research, and artificial intelligence. Take the network design problem for wild-life animal protection as an example. The movements of wild-life animals can be described using a stochastic function. The goal is to decide optimal protection measures that maximize animals' dispersal in expectation. Solving the network design problem, a special case of stochastic optimization, would help ecologists and government officials to prioritize environmental protection plans wisely, which is meaningful in securing our sustainable future.<br/><br/>Nevertheless, stochastic optimization is highly intractable because it combines two intractable problems, one of which is the inner counting problem to compute the expectation across exponentially many probabilistic outcomes, the other of which is the outer optimization problem to search for the optimal policy that maximizes the expectation. This proposal focuses on expanding a novel approach, Embedding Counting as Optimization with Randomized Constraints (ECOR), to solve stochastic optimization problems. ECOR approximates intractable counting sub-problems with optimization queries subject to randomized parity constraints, which are in turn embedded into the global optimization task. As a result, the stochastic optimization inference can be reduced to a single joint optimization of a polynomial size of the original problem with provable guarantees. This research focuses on expanding ECOR into a family of approaches that is practical for machine learning and network design applications. The limitation of the current ECOR algorithm is mainly due to its implementation as a single, large constraint program, in addition to the long parity constraints, which provide strong probabilistic guarantees but are challenging computationally. The key principle to scale up ECOR is to take an integrated view of the inner counting and the outer maximization problem. The algorithmic contribution will be driven by the intuitions gained from working on several real-world problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A poorly studied point of attrition occurs at the transition from lower- to upper-division mathematics courses.  This three-year research project intends to examine this transition by tracking the development of college students' mathematical agency and autonomy as they move into upper division math courses that emphasize mathematical proofs and argumentation.  For this work, agency refers to the student's capacity to take the initiative for their learning; autonomy refers to the student's ability to take responsibility for their learning.  The project team will investigate the agency and autonomy of students who are majoring or minoring in mathematics over time, as the students work through an introduction to proof course and into advanced proof-based courses. The project will contribute new knowledge about students' development as mathematicians over the course of their college education.   <br/><br/>Learning the concepts and skills needed for mathematical proofs and proving is a fundamental learning challenge for most college students, as their prior mathematics work has emphasized ""exercises"" (not problems), procedures modeled by instructors, and mastery via practice. This project aims to understand the dynamics of the change that happens as students move from computation-focused work to proof-focused work.  This information could inform improvements in introduction to proofs courses, in instructional practices, and in support structures such as Math Help Centers, so that students are better supported as they make the change. More broadly, this information can deepen understanding of how college students make choices about whether to continue in or leave challenging courses and majors.  Consequently, this study holds promise for improving both students' experience in and the overall ""flow"" through the STEM pipeline. The project will recruit a sample of 20 students and track their experiences in proof-based courses for five semesters. In that period, mathematics minors will take two proof-based courses, and mathematics majors typically will take four or five. Primary data will include interviews with students early and at the end of their mathematics courses (including work on proof tasks), observations of students as they work inside and outside of class, and course materials such as assignments and exams. A qualitative analysis will produce dynamic profiles of the of positive and negative changes in students' agency and autonomy over the five semesters. These results will complement and potentially help to explain student outcomes such as course grades, enrollment in additional math courses, and persistence in the mathematics major or minor.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, GBA research has been split across three fields -- organizational science, game science, and education -- without any systematic coordination or even much interaction between these silos.  Meanwhile, GBA vendors have developed their own approaches to GBA with little guidance from researchers, sometimes creating biased and otherwise problematic assessments that are currently in use within the US education system, the hiring and promotion processes for US businesses, and the US military.  Thus, the purpose of this workshop is to bring both researchers and vendors across applications domains together to create a roadmap for future research, to integrate knowledge across disciplines, and to connect researchers and vendors directly to facilitate basic research using real-world GBAs. We therefore recognize GBAs as a prime area reflecting two of NSF's ""Big Ideas"": Growing Convergence research in the context of the Future of Work at the Human-Technology Frontier.   By bringing these fields together, we will create a research roadmap to better assess the complex KSAOs needed as work continues to evolve.<br/><br/>We currently lack an integrative theoretical understanding or empirical evidence of the various cost-benefit trade-offs inherent to GBAs versus traditional measurement approaches, across relevant disciplines.  There are two primary trade-offs commonly cited: 1) broader and more responsive KSAO measurement at the expense of focused measurement and 2) improved overall assessment utility despite increased development cost.  Development of engaging and psychometrically meaningful GBAs to overcome these problems is more complex and multidimensional than survey development because prototype development requires large teams with diverse multidisciplinary expertise, yet researchers generally remain in tightly-defined disciplinary silos, developing parallel research literatures on GBA despite a general recognition of how this slows theory development. We aim to break across these disciplinary barriers with this workshop, to take the first steps towards an integrated research literature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The campaign seeks to understand the formation and development of tropical convective clouds and associated heavy rainfall in the adjacent but distinct regions of the eastern equatorial Pacific and the southwest Caribbean, along with their evolution over the intervening portions of Central America and Colombia. The campaign also examines the genesis and evolution of easterly waves, large westward-moving atmospheric disturbances (wavelengths of about 2,000 km) which occur on a weekly basis in the Caribbean and eastern Pacific. The full set of campaign awards is discoverable on the nsf.gov/awardsearch webpage by a keyword search on ""OTREC"".<br/><br/>Work supported under this award contributes to the campaign by adding a weather station in a region of interest.  The station provides continuous surface observations (winds, pressure, temperature, etc) as well as weather balloon launches to record vertical profiles of atmospheric conditions.  It is located at Nuqui (6N, 77W), on the west coast of Colombia.  The site is chosen for its proximity to the Choco' jet,  a low-level jet flowing northward over Choco' Province, which extends from the Serrania del Baudo', the western fork of the Andes in Colombia, to the Pacific coast.<br/><br/>The jet is of interest to OTREC because it extends significantly offshore and may contribute substantially to rainfall in the OTREC study area. It may also play a key role in the generation of easterly waves.  The PIs hypothesize that the diurnal cycle of heating and cooling over the western slopes of the Andes accounts for the diurnal cycle of offshore convection, despite differences in timing. They also argue that the Andean topography plays a role in organizing the rain-bearing mesoscale convective systems found over Choco' Province and the adjacent ocean.<br/><br/>The Nuqui station will operate through August and September, with balloon launches four times per day when the OTREC aircraft is collecting data over the eastern Pacific (see OTREC award 1758513).  The station is also complementary to rainwater sampling under OTREC award 1759255, for which Nuqui is one of three collection sites.  The project is also a follow-on to ChocoJex, a Colombian-led field campaign focused specifically on the Choco' jet.<br/><br/>A better understanding of extreme precipitation and its relationship to low-level jets is desirable for societal as well as scientific reasons. Research under this award directly addresses these issues, with a particular focus on hazardous mesoscale convective systems.  The work also addresses easterly waves, which can spawn destructive hurricanes.

In the past decade the explosion of available data has fundamentally changed the way researchers across disciplines approach problems. Industry is experiencing a similar disruption as data driven decision-making is driving innovation toward new skills and roles that are often coined ""data science."" While academic researchers have traditionally been the center of innovation and research, industry is pouring significant resources into developing solutions to many of these same problems. This isolated and paralleled approach to finding solutions is ripe for a conference dedicated to exchanging ideas across this traditional divide. This conference aims to draw leaders of data science in industry and academia to explore the latest theoretical advances and technological applications in data science to promote the next generation of cross-disciplinary research. This conference will make an equally important impact to the greater scientific community with a focus on recruiting and increasing diversity in data science with attendees that are not traditionally represented in STEM fields. This proposal is devoted to the support of students, post-doctoral scholars, and early-career researchers, especially those from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Data Science is a rapidly developing field with fluid boundaries but largely contains research areas in the statistical, mathematical and computational sciences. This conference will bring together both junior and senior researchers from industry and academia to exchange ideas on the recent advances of data science in these areas. Tracks include network analysis, experimental design, high dimensional signal processing and machine learning, as well as tracks dedicated to recent applications of these statistical topics to deep learning, social good, and marketing. There is a clear need for this novel approach to a conference in data science. Most conferences in this space have attendees numbering in the thousands and are either very broad with dozens of parallel sessions or focused on a single topic in data science. This will be of moderate size (~350) with three or fewer parallel sessions at any given time with many overlapping research threads so as to maximize the opportunity to collaborate and establish new research between academics and industry practitioners.

The project engages primarily Hispanic engineering students at UTEP, a majority Hispanic 4-year, public institution. Reciprocal visits to UTEP by UVic students will be supported with Canadian funds.  UTEP students will be afforded professional development and educational opportunities in cutting-edge research.  Specifically, the project engages the synergism of stem cell biology with advanced 3-dimensional biomaterial technology to manufacture tissue from stem cells. Generating patient-specific ""artificial"" tissue allows the researchers to control the rate of growth and differentiation of stem cells.  This research is significant in paving the way for modeling disease and for future drug development.  <br/><br/>Working together, the interdisciplinary team aims to identify unique approaches of targeting differentiation of human induced pluripotent stem cells [iPSCs] into neural phenotypes by utilizing advanced materials and processing. Specifically, the UTEP team has expertise in human induced pluripotent stem cell (iPSC) culture and 3D bioprinting, and UVic has expertise in culturing neuronal differentiation of human iPSC on fibrin-based scaffolds. The research focus is the application of microfluidic-based 3D bioprinting for coprinting of human iPSCs together with biomaterial scaffolds to generate bio-composites of the desired architecture with high fidelity. Bioprinting iPSCs with advanced biomaterials and scaffolds bears the promise to develop 3D tissues, ideally including encapsulated cells and facilitating their proliferation, and targeted differentiation. The project enables addressing critical questions in the field: 1) How can advanced materials and their unique designs facilitate stem cell culture and promote their differentiation? 2) How can 3D bioprinting be applied as an advanced manufacturing technique to mimic the complex environment for regulating growth and differentiation of stem cells? 3) Does the differentiated progeny of cells cultured atop micro-textured scaffolds exhibit enhanced functionality and phenotype, compared with controls? Thus, the scientific goal is to better understand the role of growth factors and micro-environmental niche and cues released from biomaterial scaffolds in the regulation of adult human iPSC differentiation into neural phenotypes. It is widely known that distractive biomaterial scaffolds that incorporate patterned structures and specific compartments of growth factors can more intricately guide stem cell development. Achieving this goal enables the ability to address fundamental neurobiological questions about neuronal growth, differentiation, which is essential for designing treatments for nervous system disorders or traumatic brain injury.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Coupled natural-human systems; improved scenarios of biodiversity; and ecosystem services that integrate the outputs of both direct and indirect drivers such as land use change, invasive alien species, overexploitation, environmental change, pollution, and models of impacts of these drivers on biodiversity and ecosystem service are needed to overcome these challenges. This type of holistic approach provides a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments and environmental co-benefits of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This research builds on such methodology to examine the impact of sea ice loss in the Arctic on ecosystems and ecosystem services in Arctic coastal regions because these nearshore waters are among some of the most productive in the world. Goals of the US part of the project are to examine biodiversity and food web changes resulting from present and future changes in seasonal ice-covered and ice-free Arctic coasts. Field data will be augmented by high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery. Collaborators from other countries will be supported by their associated national funding agencies. Results of the study will be applied to evaluate habitat loss; the impact increased coastal erosion and sediment loads have on changes in nearshore bottom habitats and biodiversity; and the cascading effects of these processes on food webs.  Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration with Norway, Poland, Canada, and Denmark. The project will build bridges between countries and communities with interests in the Arctic; engage stakeholders ranging from local communities to national environmental protection agencies, including indigenous peoples; and develop a far-reaching and rich, public, data resource on Arctic systems impacted by sea ice loss that will be available to natural and social scientists across countries and disciplines. The project also sets a framework for sustainable socio-ecological management of Arctic coasts that could be important for the planning, construction, and sustainability of new infrastructure in the development of mineral, oil, gas, and other resources; the siting of potential new shipping lanes; and assessing/predicting changes in fisheries. Additional impacts of the project include the integration of science and education and training a postdoctoral scholar to become one of the next generation of international scholars.  The project also supports a researcher from a gender underrepresented in the sciences at an institution in an EPSCoR state (i.e., Alaska).<br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance as well as to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility, and fill gaps in knowledge. Funds support U.S. participants in a large international consortium of Danish, Polish, Canadian, US, and Norwegian scientists who seek to dramatically improve understanding of how the biodiversity of organisms in Arctic nearshore environments are impacted by the loss of sea ice. Participants in this effort from other countries are funded through their associated national funding organizations. Activities of the US scientists include providing food web and other physical measurements required to evaluate the consequences of sea ice loss on biodiversity as northern Arctic coastlines change from seasonal ice-covered to ice-free coasts.  Target species include primary marine producers such as macroalgae, microphytobenthos, phytoplankton, and ice algae.  Species will be analyzed for diversity and food-web connectivity to primary producers in both pelagic and benthic realms.

MOSAiC will use intensive scientific observations from a year-long drifting station in the central Arctic to improve understanding of atmosphere-ice-ocean processes and enable significantly better models of the Arctic system and its sea ice.  MOSAiC participants from the US and more than 15 nations will work collaboratively to achieve a collection of related science objectives.  Such a large-scale scientific endeavor requires a MOSAiC Coordination Office (MCO) that coordinates the significant US contribution to MOSAiC from the National Science Foundation and other US agencies (collectively the second largest national contribution) and works jointly with German partners to provide international leadership for the overall effort. This office builds on, and formalizes, a co-leadership team between the Alfred Wegener Institute and University of Colorado that over the past nine years has jointly worked to conceive MOSAiC, develop international support and participation, secure substantial resources, and oversee the writing of MOSAiC Science and Implementation plans. Due to the overall size, scope, and complexity of MOSAiC, this dedicated coordination is essential to achieve two specific goals: to maximize the 1) scientific and 2) societal impacts of MOSAiC. The MCO provides a framework for effective scientific coordination, leadership, and communication across all MOSAiC activities using web-based tools, scientific workshops, modern multimedia content, and dedicated outreach and education activities.<br/><br/>MOSAiC is a high profile international expedition developed in collaboration with the modeling community to directly target many Arctic system processes that are still uncertain, and in most need of improvement, in coupled models. This once-in-a-generation project provides coupled-system observations, over a continuous annual cycle and over a model grid-box scale, that are uniquely positioned to build a foundation of process-level understanding for developing models that represent and predict the changing Arctic system. The MCO plays a vital role in coordinating and leveraging distinctly funded and narrowly focused science contributions towards achieving the complex, interdisciplinary, coupled system science objectives of MOSAiC. Coordination ensures the most effective use of resources and helps maximize the amount of research that is possible given limited resources. Towards advancing science, the MCO oversees the joint documentation of MOSAiC data and facilitates the development of coupled and synthesis data products that will have a lasting impact on the research community and other national and international stakeholders. The MCO also provides a framework and products to ensure significant societal impact through outreach and education efforts, and regular, effective media communication, beyond what is possible from individually funded science projects. Modern multimedia content is produced to support the development and dissemination of engaging educational products such as curriculum materials, immersive multimedia experiences, a planetarium show, and an engaging web interface. Graduate students are involved in obtaining and producing outreach content and communications products. The MCO also facilitates outreach activities across the broader MOSAiC community by engaging the participation of many MOSAiC scientists and hosting and disseminating outreach products and content. Products, such as the planetarium show along with its supporting educational curriculum materials, are intended to be distributed for use in local communities by numerous partners across the US and internationally. All activities of the MCO are subject to a rigorous evaluation to assess and maximize their overall impact. Lastly, the MCO's role in overall project co-leadership for MOSAiC science, outreach, and communications maintains a prominent role for the US in this international endeavor and ensures that US objectives are prioritized.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the proposed music generation technology, copyright issues can be avoided since the music generated is completely original. Furthermore, compared to traditional composing methods which take at least an hour for the user or composer to produce a one-minute piece of music, the proposed technology spends only less than a minute to generate the music of the same length. These advantages will allow small game developers and self-media producers to generate original music that fit to their needs in a very short amount of time with minimum cost, which significantly benefits the game and self-media industries.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project features the technology of automatic music generation from user's humming based on AI and music theory. Without any professional knowledge of music, a user can simply start by humming a short melody. Combining the AI algorithm with music theory, the application completes other necessary musical components (such as chord progression, beats and tempo) and expands the short input melody into a full piece of music for which the user can change genre and do post-editing. The technical differentiators of the proposed technology are threefold. Firstly, a pitch detection algorithm is developed to recognize the user's humming tune and turn it into musical notes, which are then optimized to conform to music theory and logic. Secondly, a novel algorithm combining Recurrent Neural Network and music theory is developed to generate a full piece of music, including the main melody, chord progression, motive and accompaniment, based on the user's short input melody. Thirdly, the post editing stage allows the user to modify the notes and genre according to the generated chord progression.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The approach is based upon the tenet that prediction serves as the ultimate test of the scientific understanding of geophysical systems. Achieving accurate forecasting of near-Earth space environmental conditions would be critical to society needs regarding radio communication, navigation, positioning, and satellite tracking. Effective numerical prediction of geospace conditions would allow improved protection of important space assets and related systems in the event of natural hazards. A full time graduate student and two undergraduate students would be supported in this award. Coursework concerning data assimilation methodology would be developed that would also addresses portions of the modeling framework that underlies the inclusion of data from Earth and Geospace sensors.<br/><br/>The funded research represents a paradigm shift from a deterministic to a probabilistic modeling framework that possibly would be pivotal to the generation of foundational knowledge regarding the predictability of the whole atmosphere dynamical processes. This knowledge would facilitate optimization of observing systems and the targeting of observations to maximize data impact. The project strategies would develop the capacity to understand the role of uncertainty in constructing meaning out of ambiguous facts, which is also a central concern of probabilistic forecasting research. The ingestion of data from geophysical sensors into a comprehensive global circulation model framework using data assimilation techniques would provide significant enhancement of the accuracy of any forecast predictions generated. Thus, the funded research would provide realistic, global and instantaneous probabilistic perspectives on the day-to-day variability of the thermosphere and ionosphere, which up to now, have been difficult to assess. The project achievements in the data assimilation procedures utilized would be made accessible to the community through open source portals. Consequently, this project would help alleviate the geospace community's need for new research tools to optimally combine heterogeneous observational data from distributed arrays of small ground-based instrumentation with current and future satellite data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To do this, the work will: (1) develop novel insights as to how teens experience online risks, (2) identify the mechanisms by which teens seek support to cope with these experiences, (3) translate these insights into reusable design patterns for sociotechnical interventions for online safety, (4) work directly with teens to co-design solutions that promote self-regulation and leverage their support networks, (5) instantiate these designs into high-fidelity prototypes and real-world applications, (6) evaluate whether these solutions are developmentally appropriate in helping adolescents manage online risks more effectively, and (7) disseminate these evidence-based sociotechnical interventions for protecting adolescents from online risks to designers and developers of online platforms that cater to teens.  This work serves to protect particularly vulnerable youth populations that are at highest risk of severe harm because they lack active online parental mediation.<br/><br/>The research integrates adolescent developmental psychology with interaction design and computer science to create new knowledge, theoretical frameworks, reusable design patterns, and technologies. It uses a social ecological framework of adolescent resilience to design technologies that help teens self-regulate and leverage their existing support networks in a way that teaches them how to manage online risks more effectively. By doing so, this project makes fundamental contributions to the adolescent online safety literature by: (1) closing the sociotechnical gap between the unique developmental needs of adolescents and the systems designed to keep teens safe from online risks, and (2) building on the risk and protective factors that have been identified in the literature to design effective and novel sociotechnical interventions to more effectively protect teens from online risks. Further, this novel ""Safety by Design"" approach will empirically contribute to a body of useful knowledge that improves the lives of young people by designing, developing, evaluating, and disseminating evidence-based sociotechnical interventions for adolescent online safety that can be easily translated to practice.

The project seeks to promote inclusion, diversity, equity, and access for learning experiences and careers in STEM. It provides middle and high school students opportunities and resources to immerse themselves in STEM activities throughout the year. The project has identified guidance counselors as an untapped resource. Counselors play a pivotal role as gatekeepers to informal learning opportunities and to educational paths into STEM careers. The project also enables multiple school stakeholders to effectively prepare students for a STEM major/career. This effort will benefit society by widening the path to high-demand, high-wage, high-skill STEM jobs and thereby improve the diversity of our nation's technical workforce. The project is a 3-pillar intervention strategy with 24 partner schools participating in a comprehensive 10-day (80 hour) summer institute to equip teams (each consisting of a counselor, a teacher, and a third school stakeholder) with the knowledge, attitudes, behaviors, and resources to act as effective STEM advocates. The project will facilitate a school-year networked improvement community (NIC) that connects teams within and across schools as research is being conducted to better understand and address underlying inclusion, diversity, equity, and access issues in STEM. The NIC process will allow the PIs to work with the teams to implement out-of-school-time STEM clubs to provide unique engineering design, project-based, and other hands-on experiences to 1,000 students throughout the school year. <br/><br/>The Strategies project will address the following questions.  What learning experiences involving emerging technologies effectively enable diverse populations of students gain familiarity and relevant competencies with these technologies, and what factors influence the outcomes of the learning experiences?  What factors and key experiences effectively promote awareness of STEM careers, motivation to pursue a STEM career, and persistence in undertaking education pathways to those careers, particularly among students from underrepresented populations? What strategies to engage principals, guidance counselors, and other school system administrative leaders effectively promote student and teacher adoption and effective use of practices and technologies that support STEM learning and career awareness, and what factors influence the outcomes of those strategies? The fundamental project goal is to enable female, underrepresented minority, and/or low-income middle and high school students to participate in sustained, intensive, hands-on STEM learning experiences that build technical knowledge and ability and that offer insights into different STEM careers. The project will enable students access to participate, make the impact of such experiences endure, integrate them with other school efforts, and purposely engage underrepresented students. The project team has significant infrastructure for the summer camps and an extensive network of partner schools, districts, and career and technical education consortia to assist in implementing and institutionalizing the strategies. Using a mixed-methods approach, the project team will examine program effectiveness on the development of technical skills and self-efficacy in students and on the practices of counselors and other team members. Each out-of-school-time STEM club will be outfitted with equipment, software, and using published curriculum materials to do challenging yet age-appropriate projects that teach basic concepts in design of experiment, analog and digital circuits, signals, electromagnetics, communications, controls, power and energy, microscopy, nanotechnology, photonics, algorithms, and programming. Scholarships will be provided to 228 students to attend existing STEM summer camps at the University of Illinois, where the students can explore different STEM majors and develop technical skills under the guidance of university faculty in high-tech instructional labs. The project team will investigate the synergistic effects of school year STEM clubs, university-hosted summer camps, and a NIC that includes counselors and teachers. The research is potentially transformative because it creates a new paradigm for advancing students' interest, self-efficacy, abilities, and pathways in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite these broad societal implications, the mechanisms driving the deep warming are still poorly understood. This project aims to improve our understanding of these mechanisms through a global study using a new method to utilize chemical tracers (in this case chlorofluorocarbons; CFCs) to overcome previous obstacles due to limitations from sparse data. The analysis will capitalize on a growing data set of detectable CFC concentrations throughout the deep ocean as anthropogenic tracers enter and circulate along the bottom limb of the overturning circulation of the ocean. This data set allows for both defining new pathways that bring new waters into the deep ocean and assessment of the variability in deep water formation rates. The variability will allow for correlations with surface conditions to evaluate driving mechanisms so that they can be included in climate models. In addition, this work will update decadal trends in abyssal warming, anthropogenic carbon uptake, and deep steric sea level rise annually through the end of the project in 2021. The results  will help to close current global energy, carbon, and sea level budgets and advance our understanding of the physical mechanisms forcing the distribution of anthropogenic heat and carbon throughout the ocean. This work will demonstrate and explain modes of deep variability previously unknown for use in climate models leading to improved long-term climate projections under increased CO2 emissions, therefore enabling better societal adaptability to changes to come. The project will support a third year graduate student for his PhD work at SIO. In addition, smaller summer projects will be made available for undergraduate summer students through the Scripps Institution of Oceanography Undergraduates Research Fellowship (SURF) program. The project will produce gridded global CFC, deep ocean warming, and steric sea level rise data products that will be made available to the broader scientific and educational communities.<br/><br/>The overall objective of this proposal is to understand the variability in the bottom limb of the Meridional Overturning Circulation (MOC) in order to quantify, explain, and forecast the role that the deep ocean plays in ocean heat and carbon uptake. The deep ocean is warming at a significant rate with important climatic implications for sea level rise and ocean heat absorption.  Despite these broad societal implications, the mechanism driving this deep warming is still poorly understood and difficult to simulate in climate models, decreasing our ability to predict how the climate will change under increased CO2 emissions . One hypothesis is the warming is driven by a decrease in deep water formation around Antarctica.  The deep CFC data will be used to produce annual gridded maps within neutral density surfaces around the globe by modeling the oceanic subsurface response and fitting the data within its uncertainty. The gridded CFC dataset will allow for inference of deep circulation, ventilation, and assessment of any interdecadal change in locations with multiple decades of data. It will validate any observed interdecadal variability by comparing to changes in tracer age, oxygen, and volume of deep water along repeated hydrographic sections. The decadal variability will be compared to observed deep warming trends in order to identify if these changes are causing the recent accumulation of heat in the abyssal ocean and explore any mechanisms driving the variability.  This work will allow better characterization of the mean and variability of the deep transport along the bottom limb of the MOC and how it has affected deep-ocean temperatures. The new method to find tracer transport from CFCs to provide an improved estimate of deep ocean circulation, ventilation, and variability will also lay the groundwork for future monitoring of global deep-ocean warming.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The need to extract quantifiable information from such data sets has stimulated, in particular, a vibrant development of diverse mathematical methodologies. Despite the size of available data sites, often referred to as ""Big Data"", they nevertheless often fall short of providing enough information about a complex process to come up with reliable predictions, a must for any technological design. The physical laws that govern such processes can often be formulated in terms of mathematical models with excellent predictive capabilities. The more detailed information is sought on complex processes the more complex the models become with ensuing consequences for their mathematical and numerical treatment. Moreover, the identification of proper models in the classical sense may become increasingly limited. Therefore, a proper integration or synthesis of information provided by data as well as by models will be of paramount lasting importance. The central objective of the Spring School is to support young researchers in developing the necessary conceptual orientation. The project helps accelerating and fostering a broad based expertise in most topical research areas with high impact on technology and society.  Internationally renowned experts, representing  the relevant areas, will deliver six two-hour block lectures. These lectures aim, in particular, at unveiling important conceptual interconnections between different areas that are often not obvious. The lectures will be interlaced with break out sessions and opportunities for the participants to actively engage. <br/> <br/><br/>This covers forward and inverse tasks in Uncertainty Quantification, parameter and state estimation, data assimilation, machine learning, structural imaging in material science, and modeling.

Coupled natural-human systems; improved scenarios of biodiversity; and ecosystem services that integrate the outputs of both direct and indirect drivers such as land use change, invasive alien species, overexploitation, environmental change, pollution, and models of impacts of these drivers on biodiversity and ecosystem service are needed to overcome these challenges. This type of holistic approach provides a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments and environmental co-benefits of biodiversity and ecosystem services. This research builds on such methodology to examine the impact of sea ice loss in the Arctic on ecosystems and ecosystem services in Arctic coastal regions because these nearshore waters are among some of the most productive in the world. Goals of the US part of the project are to examine biodiversity and food web changes resulting from present and future changes in seasonal ice-covered and ice-free Arctic coasts. Field data will be augmented by high-resolution multispectral satellite imagery. Collaborators from other countries will be supported by their associated national funding agencies. Results of the study will be applied to evaluate habitat loss; the impact increased coastal erosion and sediment loads have on changes in nearshore bottom habitats and biodiversity; and the cascading effects of these processes on food webs.  Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration with Norway, Poland, Canada, and Denmark. The project will build bridges between countries and communities with interests in the Arctic; engage stakeholders ranging from local communities to national environmental protection agencies, including indigenous peoples; and develop a far-reaching and rich, public, data resource on Arctic systems impacted by sea ice loss that will be available to natural and social scientists across countries and disciplines. The project also sets a framework for sustainable socio-ecological management of Arctic coasts that could be important for the planning, construction, and sustainability of new infrastructure in the development of mineral, oil, gas, and other resources; the siting of potential new shipping lanes; and assessing/predicting changes in fisheries. Additional impacts of the project include the integration of science and education and training a postdoctoral scholar to become one of the next generation of international scholars.  The project also supports a researcher from a gender underrepresented in the sciences at an institution in an EPSCoR state (i.e., Alaska).<br/><br/>This award supports US researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a coalition of 26 funding agencies from 23 countries through the Belmont Forum call for proposals on ""Scenarios of Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services"". The call was a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that contribute to the development of scenarios, models, and decision-support tools for understanding and solving critical issues facing our planet. The goal of the competition was to improve and apply participatory scenario methods to enhance research relevance and its acceptance as well as to address gaps in methods for modelling impact drivers and policy interventions. It was also to develop and communicate levels of uncertainty associated with the models, to improve data accessibility, and fill gaps in knowledge. Funds support U.S. participants in a large international consortium of Danish, Polish, Canadian, US, and Norwegian scientists who seek to dramatically improve understanding of how the biodiversity of organisms in Arctic nearshore environments are impacted by the loss of sea ice. Participants in this effort from other countries are funded through their associated national funding organizations. Activities of the US scientists include providing food web and other physical measurements required to evaluate the consequences of sea ice loss on biodiversity as northern Arctic coastlines change from seasonal ice-covered to ice-free coasts.  Target species include primary marine producers such as macroalgae, microphytobenthos, phytoplankton, and ice algae.  Species will be analyzed for diversity and food-web connectivity to primary producers in both pelagic and benthic realms. Measurements of the physical and chemical characteristics of habitats will complement and provide context for the biological measures. International collaborators will use remote sensing with high-resolution multi-spectral satellite imagery to generalize results from local sites to be applicable the wider, geographical, pan-Arctic scale. Remotely sensed optical data of chlorophyll a (Chl a); total suspended sediment; colored dissolved organic matter (CDOM); and, where applicable, nearshore vegetation will be used to provide insights into the dynamic, spatial, and temporal variability of key food-web environmental parameters of Arctic coasts under different icing conditions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The membrane filtration technology developed allows for the separation of components of interest and value in the oil & gas, food & beverage, life sciences, textiles, and semiconductor manufacturing spaces in a more efficient manner than the methods in use today. By replacing these more expensive and energy intensive processes, the technology can provide a significant cost savings to the industrial end user, thereby generating surplus revenue, increased hiring capacity, and facilitating growth. In addition, the project will yield a societal benefit by providing a more effective and energy efficient approach for industrial process separations and wastewater treatment.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project further develops a robust membrane filtration technology. The membrane consists of commonly available thin-sheet silicon through which nanoscale pores are chemically etched using a simple patented process. These pores extend from one side of the silicon sheet to the other, thereby acting as channels through which water can flow. Molecules, particles, and other constituents of interest are rejected both by the physical size of the pores, and by the chemical character of the membrane surface, allowing for the removal, concentration, or separation of important components. The membrane offers a unique value proposition in that it combines a very small size cutoff offered by polymeric filters with the harsh environment compatibility of ceramic filters, while possessing excellent resistance to clogging and blockage. These properties enable low maintenance separation performance in a wide range of industrial applications where exposure to harsh environments such as high or low pH, organic solvents, and high temperatures is required.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These components work in concert to efficiently convert sunlight to chemical fuel for the cell.  The components are arranged so that when sunlight is absorbed by the pigments (color-containing compounds), the energy can move quickly from one component to the next before the energy is lost.  Nature accomplishes energy transfer with remarkable efficiency using light-harvesting organelles. Mimicking such a complex structure artificially could lead to formation of light-weight materials, whose photosynthetic function could be exquisitely controlled. However, making artificial photosynthetic systems remains a major challenge.  With support from the Macromolecular, Supramolecular and Nanochemistry Program of the NSF Division of Chemistry, Professor Ayzner at the University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) and his students are building artificial light-harvesting organelles based on soft molecular materials, such as polymers. These polymers can self-assemble into larger structures that can rapidly transport excited states through space, thus mimicking the fundamental aspects of photosynthetic organelles. The project is providing training opportunities for graduate students.  Professor Ayzner is using the topic of energy harvesting as the vehicle to teach advanced chemical problem-solving skills to transfer students, thereby helping to prepare them for sustained success in the chemical sciences. <br/><br/>Accomplishing the formation of an artificial light-harvesting organelle first requires laying a foundation for assembling and interfacing an efficient electronic energy transfer (EET) relay with a larger structural scaffold. To this end, Professor Ayzner is synthesizing and assembling conjugated polyelectrolytes (CPE) into donor/acceptor complexes, whose structure and thermodynamics can be controlled via the coupling between electronic and ionic degrees of freedom. This project elucidates how the backbone of a CPE influences the EET efficiency within the complex by systematically tuning the mean polyelectrolyte length and chemical structure. The phase separation behavior and EET in co-existing phases of inter-CPE complexes is then characterized to elucidate the influence of excess ions on light-harvesting. Complexes are then interfaced with self-assembled vesicle-type compartments to form the foundation of a soft light-harvesting super-structure. Characterization of resulting assemblies involves combining time-resolved electronic spectroscopy, photon scattering, microscopy and rheological measurements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the research value, some of these collections are in distress due to lack of local institutional support.  One approach for raising awareness and support for the research and education value of campus collections is a student-led Natural History Collections Club (NHCC).  Since 2013, several clubs have formed based on the NHCC model to train the next generation of undergraduate students in biological collections methods and management; and to raise awareness, increase scientific and educational use, of their campus natural history collections.  These clubs collectively form the Natural History Collections Club Network (NHCCN). The Network has hosted workshops at international and regional meetings to encourage other groups to take up the NHCC model on their campuses and to start a student club and become part of the NHCCN. Through this award, workshop activities are planned that recruit and educate interested students and faculty advisors to develop a NHCC, strengthen the existing network, and support participation in existing NHCCs. <br/><br/>A 2019 workshop will take place during a full day of the annual meeting of the Society for the Preservation of Natural History Collections (SPNHC), which meets May 26-31.  The workshop agenda includes training and discussion on topics such as natural history collections documentation, specimen digitization, and experiential learning. Invitations for workshops will target institutions that may benefit most from joining the NHCCN, such as those that have expressed interest in improving student involvement in collections, particularly institutions with small collections and institutions with minority-serving emphases such as Historically Black Colleges and Universities (HBCUs), Tribal Colleges and Universities (TCUs), and Hispanic-Serving Institutions (HSIs). Universities with small natural history collections often contain many records of their surrounding ecosystems not duplicated in larger facilities and therefore provide unique representation of biological diversity to national and global data resources. The support provided through this award represents a cost-efficient way to ensure the maintenance, expansion, and data sharing of participating collections by involving students and recruiting participants from small collections that are committed to the success and sustainability of those collections.

The specific research focuses on the preparation of a series of specialized compounds that present carbohydrates in a precise fashion to study fundamental carbohydrate-protein interactions. These interactions are important because they play critical roles in a number of biological processes from cell communication to microbial infectivity and cancer. Despite their importance, many questions remain as to how the precise presentation of carbohydrates impacts their ability to be recognized by proteins, and how the resulting carbohydrate-protein interaction impacts downstream biological events. The research outlined in this award aims to address this knowledge gap while simultaneously providing valuable research opportunities in a high-impact international research setting. Undergraduate participants will receive training in carbohydrate chemistry, polymer chemistry, molecular spectroscopy, and biochemical and biophysical techniques that will enhance their education and prepare them for a competitive international workforce. Furthermore, results from this award will promote the progress of science by directly advancing the fields of carbohydrate and polymer science, including initiatives highlighted under the National Academy of Sciences report, ""Transforming the Glycosciences: A Roadmap to the Future (2012)"", which specifically emphasizes a broader understanding of the roles of carbohydrate polymers in chemical, biological and industrial processes. Long term, the results from this research may ultimately lead to advancements in national health, prosperity and welfare by providing a better understanding of the fundamental roles carbohydrates play in human health and disease. <br/><br/>One of the major challenges in studying molecular interactions between carbohydrates and other biomolecules is the low binding affinity of individual carbohydrate subunits. Biological systems overcome this issue by increasing localized concentrations of carbohydrate residues or by the multivalent presentation of carbohydrate ligands on proteins, lipids or cell surfaces. Molecular scaffolds, which can be selectively tuned to vary the number and density of sugar ligands along a defined oligomeric backbone, can be used to gain fundamental insights into multivalent carbohydrate interactions and the processes they govern. The research in this proposal, which will be conducted with Davidson College undergraduate participants and in collaboration with Prof. Dr. Laura Hartmann and her team at Heinrich-Heine-Universitat, uses a systematic approach to synthesize several precision glycoconjugates to study the relationships between the ways in which carbohydrate ligands are presented (e.g. on a rigid oligoproline scaffold versus a more flexible oligo(amidoamine) scaffold), and how that presentation impacts carbohydrate binding in two classes of carbohydrate binding proteins: galectins and the C-type lectins. The overarching research question that will be addressed by the proposed research is: How does the presentation of carbohydrates on well-defined rigid or flexible scaffolds impact their ability to engage proteins involved in specific recognition events? The outcomes of this research will provide greater insight into factors that govern carbohydrate recognition and may help scientists better understand how recognition events and the corresponding biological outcomes of those events are tuned by carbohydrate display.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project investigates new approaches to perform grasping and in-hand manipulation using multi-fingered robot hands. The primary novelty in this work comes from examining new ways of combining knowledge gained automatically by the robot from its own sensors with models given to the robot by its programmer. The research team will perform extensive empirical evaluation of the algorithms developed in order to quantify the benefit of these new techniques over previously proposed analytic or data-driven approaches. This will allow for fast translation of the research results into robots used in industrial and service settings. This project will conduct educational outreach activities using robot manipulation to increase and reinforce middle and high schoolers' interest in computing.<br/><br/>For autonomous robots to operate seamlessly as assistants in human environments, they must be endowed with the ability to aptly perform dexterous manipulation. Contemporary robot hardware provides the necessary dexterity and sensitivity to perform dexterous manipulation, but algorithmic shortcomings currently cripple deployment of robust multi-fingered grasping, regrasping, and in-hand manipulation of unknown and partially modeled objects. The research goal of this project is to unify concepts from model-based planning and data-driven learning for manipulation to improve dexterous manipulation of unknown objects. The first research thrust examines adding model-based constraints to perform grasp synthesis with a learned deep network. The second research thrust evaluates the hypothesis that learning feedback policies, approximate models, and graph structures from tactile and visual sensing will improve execution of pre-planned in-hand manipulation trajectories.  The investigator proposes viewing these problems as an instance of probabilistic inference.

This project will apply advanced microscopy techniques to study how material crosses the polymer rich interface of the blood vessel wall, and seeks to build our basic understanding of structure of the interface and its biological function. The research effort is closely linked to an educational plan that seeks to develop new laboratory experiences for students at the interface between physical and life sciences. This plan is focused on the inclusion of undergraduate researchers in the outlined research, the development of a new laboratory course, and a sequence of related K-12 outreach activities. These endeavors seek to establish strong links between the field of biophysical research, the undergraduate life science curriculum, and K-12 cross-curricular activities to highlight roles played by materials in living systems. This project will expand our knowledge of the basic physics of the polymer rich interface in the blood vessel wall and its role in maintaining the integrity of the blood vessel wall.  The results of this project may lead to the development of new drug delivery methods or selective filtering technologies. <br/><br/><br/>Technical<br/>The mechanical environment of living cells plays an essential role in regulating cell function and maintaining the integrity of tissue.  In the vascular wall a polymer brush tethered to the cell surface, known as the glycocalyx, forms a critical part of the cellular microenvironment. Current models of the glycocalyx leave important questions about their role in vascular function unanswered.  Two areas of particular importance are: (i) how these brushes are dynamically structured when exposed to pulsatile fluid flow and (ii) how this affects key functions of the vasculature such as material transport from the bloodstream to surrounding tissues.  This project will address these questions using fast particle tracking and advanced fluid flow control to directly visualize the dynamics nanoparticles interacting with the glycocalyx of living cells.  The primary goal of this project is to expand our understanding of the role of interfacial polymer brushes in maintaining the integrity of the vasculature and regulating material transport from the blood stream to the layer of endothelial cells in the blood vessel wall. This could lead to new diagnostic techniques to detect the early warning signs of vascular disease, reveal new mechanisms for drug delivery or lead to new approaches for selective filtering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently robot design is a time and skill intensive process requiring years of training and multiple iterations of prototyping and testing. Unlocking the full potential of ubiquitous robotics requires new intelligent design tools that support experienced and novice users alike in the design process, from ideation to prototyping to validation stages. The resulting methods will have the potential to revolutionize the way robotic devices are created, increasing people's ability to design and use custom devices while reducing the time spent on this customization. New flexibility and availability of robotic systems will improve the integration of these technologies into everyday society. Professional engineers will gain the ability to perform systems-level analyses and verification of their designs, streamlining their work, encouraging more creativity, and ultimately producing more efficient and effective machines. In education, this project will inform next generation scientists and engineers by providing intuitive tools for exploring engineering concepts.<br/><br/>The project will synthesize ideas from mechanics, computational geometry, robotics, and data clustering and compression to create a computational framework for designing, fabricating, and controlling legged robots that are robust to task, environment, and fabrication uncertainties. While the application will be legged locomotion, the work will focus on computational frameworks and insights that can be generalized to broader areas of robot design and customization. Unlike static objects, legged robots rely on complex interactions with their surrounding environment to locomote, and their performance is therefore very dependent on their physical designs. Compared with existing computational design tools, which focus on optimizing a single metric, this work will therefore evaluate the robustness of a proposed design and its suitability for a practical locomotion task. The project will produce 1) modular, graph-based representations for a robot's combined geometry, kinematics, and joint motion, 2) new hierarchical data clustering and compression techniques for semantic representation and evaluation of a design, and 3) algorithms for design synthesis that provide explainable designs based on evaluated efficiency-robustness tradeoffs. The integrated education plan also brings together ideas from engineering and computer science to incorporate numerical simulations and design techniques into courses at the undergraduate and graduate level, form an open-source robot design community, and encourage broader participation in STEM through outreach to K-12 students and teachers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Daniel Crawford, of Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University is supported by an award from the Chemical Theory, Models and Computational Methods program to develop computational tools to predict the optical properties of chiral molecules in solution.   A chiral molecule has the same atoms connected in a different order.  Chiral molecules cannot be super-imposed on their mirror image.  There is a ""left-handed"" and a ""right-handed"" form each of which turns the waves of light into different directions.  Understanding chiral molecules is especially important to the pharmaceutical industry as one chiral form may be of great medicinal value, while the other form may be of no value or toxic.  The accurate prediction of the optical properties of chiral molecules dissolved in liquids is a daunting task for computational chemistry. While computer models of simple molecular properties are well established, interactions of chiral molecules with light present unique challenges even for state-of-the-art computational methods.  In this research project, Professor Crawford and coworkers develop robust and accurate computational techniques that take less time than current methods.  These computational tools allow researchers to understand the relationship between chiral molecular structures and their interactions with light.  The new tools provides the chemistry community with a deeper understanding how molecules interact with light.  This research program benefits the larger field of computational science through the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students in the fundamental theory and development of quantum chemical methods. Software developed during this project is included in PSI4, a widely used computational chemistry package that is freely available to the community.  Dr. Crawford is one of the lead developers of PSI4.<br/><br/>Daniel Crawford and coworkers advance the high-accuracy modeling of chiroptical properties in the liquid phase by streamlining coupled cluster theory through complementary approaches.  They build upon reduced-scaling methods to develop production-level implementation of an ""extended local-pair-natural-orbital"" approach, in which the correlation domain for each pair of localized occupied orbitals is constructed based on natural orbitals computed via an approximate second-order field-perturbed density. The Crawford group is extending their recent collaborative work on the development of a ""diagrammatic"" stochastic coupled cluster approach that exhibits a hundred-fold reduction in the memory costs for the solution of high-accuracy coupled cluster methods (through quadruple excitations). Following their demonstration that the introduction of a time-dependent external electric field yields substantially greater wave function sparsity than that of the field-perturbed wave function, they are developing a locally correlated real-time coupled cluster approach that can take advantage of existing linear-scaling frameworks. Development of these new models involves numerous, well-established collaborations with both experimentalists and theorists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They also it possible to produce new products that only a decade ago were considered unproducible. For example, 3D printing with metals now allows engineers to create mesh-based items that weigh less than the same solid item.  North Carolina State University, in collaboration with Iowa State University, aims to improve how engineers and technicians learn the principles and skills of additive manufacturing.  This project will host a series of workshops to catalyze the creation of a central repository for state-of-the-art curricular materials to facilitate authoring, evaluating, and disseminating materials for advanced manufacturing education.  The intention is to develop teaching materials that instructors can customize to meet the needs of their specific course and student population. It is expected that a repository of such materials could significantly reduce costs to students by limiting the need for text books.  In addition, these materials may improve student learning outcomes by incorporating specific laboratory hardware and illustrations so that the training is more relevant to the local setting.<br/><br/>The investigators have previously developed customizable materials for teaching additive manufacturing and shared them with colleagues.  These materials will be used as the foundation for the repository.  Each workshop will assemble groups of engineers, technologists, and faculty involved in manufacturing and/or manufacturing education to discuss the use and adoption of these materials.  The workshops are intended to: 1) critique the proposed concept of these materials as user adaptable resources; 2) obtain buy-in for a repository from the manufacturing community; and 3) identify early adopters and developers to create a plan to build the repository. Each workshop will last about four hours.  Three of the workshops will be held at existing meetings, including two at engineering professional society meetings and one at a technical educators meeting.  The final meeting will be held at North Carolina State University and serve to consolidate what was learned from the previous workshops.  The expectation is that results of this effort will contribute to increasing the quality and efficiency of advanced manufacturing education.

In current surgical procedures, hydrogel adhesives are limited to applications as sealants in conjunction with sutures. In addition to the unmatched strength of sutures, problems such as poor bonding on wet surfaces, low strength, and high swelling limit the reproducibility, applicability, and adoption of currently available adhesives and commercialization of other advanced tissue regenerative materials. The goal is to bring to market an adhesive platform that will overcome those limitations and introduce new functionalities. Furthermore, the ability to use protein engineering to improve material functionality will broaden the target market segments. The availability of an effective hydrogel adhesive platform will empower patients and health care providers with a next-generation tool that can replace sutures to achieve cosmetically and functionally improved healing, decrease complications, and increase patient comfort.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is focused on the development of a protein-based adhesive that can bond to soft tissues. An advantage of the bioinspired recombinant protein in our core technology is that it can resist washout once applied because it deswells (does not absorb water) at body temperature. Once cured, the resulting hydrogel is flexible and can maintain its properties unlike other hydrogel adhesives which absorb water and swell. Genetic engineering also allows direct integration of functional peptide sequences. During development and testing, the project will establish the design principles that will enable the creation of next-generation adhesives with high bonding, flexibility, and bio-interactive properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to enable these opportunities by developing an automated educational intervention tool for learning engineering mechanics.  This open-access, problem-solving interface will provide engineering students with feedback and tutoring, based on their performance on practice exercises. Since all developed materials will be open-source and open-access, the project can also inform and support the work of students and teachers beyond the local institution. By focusing on developing strong analytical problem-solving skills, this project directly responds to industry and the federal government priorities for developing an engineering workforce that is capable of innovative problem solving.  Thus, this project has the potential to contribute to the ability of the U.S. to maintain its economic competitiveness and position as a global leader in innovation. <br/><br/>The project will: 1) develop an innovative problem delivery and assessment system and evaluate its effectiveness in meeting specific learning and assessment goals in engineering mechanics; 2) systematically study how this technology-rich problem-solving interface can enhance the learning, teaching, and assessment of complex knowledge through an education research study; and 3) critically evaluate opportunities and barriers to scaling and transferring the innovation across educational contexts.  This study should contribute to understanding how technological solutions, such as automated tutoring systems, can enhance learning and assessment of complex knowledge and skills.

Spoken language use reflects many factors, including cognitive constraints on production and perception of sound, speech community membership, and cultural practices, among others. This study models the interrelationships between these factors and participation in regional sound changes or resistance to change, bilectal use of mainstream English together with a heritage language variety used in the local speech community, or monolectal use of an ethnic variety of English. The study site is Washington state. Unlike many places in the United States where ethnic groups settled into small communities with relatively insular social networks (resulting in the famous ethnic enclaves of the East coast and Inland North), the Pacific Northwest has long been characterized by regional and social mobility. The notion of ""community"" itself is complex, but requires better understanding as non-white, mobile individuals become a larger part of the US population. This study also uses practice-based, rather than assignment-based methods for determining ethnic group membership. General practice in the language sciences in North America has been to sample primarily from majority-ethnicity groups in a speech community. The assumption taken has been that non-white speakers do not participate in regional sound changes, but are embedded in separate speech communities defined by shared ethnic identity. While partly true, this assumption has been shown to be a vast oversimplification. There is scholarship showing that speakers' use of ethnolectal forms is not predicted by race as much as by social network composition. But complex social models need to be better-integrated into linguistic research. Race has been conflated with ethnicity, for one thing. Race (physical appearance or genetic heritage), rather than ethnicity (cultural heritage, practice, and perceived affiliation) has been used as an initial tool for constructing research samples, leading to a priori determinations about speech community membership.  <br/><br/>This project utilizes social network measures of localness of affective network, homophily (similarity-based affiliation), network range, and referential network.  Linguistic data are drawn from vowel system recordings and measures of the acoustic cues to phonetic production, focusing on sets of features known to be associated with mainstream as well as local dialects. Spoken data provide the stimuli for cross-dialect testing of listener sensitivity to fine-grained, time-varying differences in sound. The result is a model of participation in linguistic change relevant for mobile, non-white Pacific Northwest speakers, contributing to sociolinguistic theorization of dialect evolution and interethnic contact, as well as listeners' use of social information in the perception of phonetic variation.  The study involves collaboration between researchers at the University of Washington, and Heritage University, located on Yakama First Nation lands in Toppenish, Washington.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dramatic turns of events are key to recognizing and communicating effective reports or stories about events.  Autonomous systems will work more effectively with humans in obtaining and conveying such narrative when they too can recognize what is dramatic (or tragic, or comical) about human events.  The challenge is to effectively convey such concepts to a computer in such a way that humans and autonomous systems can effectively work together in this. This research studies how to direct a team of robots to obtain video footage to produce clips that trace a dramatic story arc. It is an examination of how such systems might achieve goals that people consider to be abstract or high-level. Within this project, the programs that command teams of robots must predict likely events, direct the robots to be in position for obtaining the desired footage, and re-plan based on observed events. This challenge encompasses a rich and previously unstudied class of problems for robot systems.  It will constitute a unique demonstration of robots that are capable of achieving high-level goals as they process data in forms which combine both continuous and discrete views of the world in a new and unusual way.  More broadly, the research will advance how computers can fuse and summarize video streams. Both skills are needed for automatically generating synopses and in editing videos. Obvious places where this is useful include helping secure the nation (for surveillance), taming the deluge of online multimedia content (for summarization), and advancing applications in the creative industries (for editing). The research project will also use the ideas underlying these pieces in a new robotics course with students at three institutions going head-to-head in a series of competition-based class projects. This course (taught, among other places, at a Hispanic-Serving Institution) will contribute to the development of the STEM workforce of the future, helping increase American competitiveness.<br/><br/>The project advances current knowledge by formulating new theory and developing novel algorithms for autonomous and robot systems, with a focus on those systems with minimal or no human operator intervention. The research contributes novel data representations for robots that will inhabit rich environments such as those characterized by uncertain, unanticipated, and dynamically changing circumstances.

Since an acousto-optical sensor is used, this information transfer is achieved with no adverse effects, such as RF heating. During diagnostic procedures, the sensor can help quantify the RF field exposure of the patient in real-time, preventing excessive tissue heating. Furthermore, it may enable imaging of patients with medical implants who are not currently imaged by MRI due to safety concerns. As a commercial product, the sensor will potentially decrease the costs for all the stake-holders within the health industry (hospitals, insurance companies, governmental institutions, etc.) while decreasing the risk to the patients and improving health outcomes.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on a radio frequency (RF) safe acousto-optical sensor to locally measure the RF field in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) which in turn provides the signals to track the interventional devices like catheters and needles during interventional procedures under MRI as well as to measure RF energy exposure of the patient. The main safety concern with MRI is RF heating due to metal cables required to carry the signal from an antenna to the outside system. The solution here is replacing all the metal cables with optical glass fiber, which eliminates the RF heating. To convert the RF signal into optical modulation, a compact acousto-optic sensor is used as an intermediate medium between the antenna and the optical fiber. This is achieved by exciting a piezoelectric transducer on an optical fiber with the RF signal generated by miniature MRI coils and antennas which in turn generates acoustic waves in the optical fiber. Since the signal is generated and transmitted over an optical fiber to the MRI system without any conductors, this eliminates the RF heating safety issue. The sensor prototype has been successfully bench tested and proof of principle for interventional procedures has been demonstrated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This program will send 6 CSU students per year to work on ATLAS research projects for ATLAS detector upgrades and incoming ATLAS Run-3 data taking and physics. The physics potential of incoming Run-3 will be over 10 times greater than Run-1 during which the Higgs boson was discovered. The Higgs discovery by ATLAS and CMS experiments of LHC in 2012 has captured the attention and imagination of the public and students throughout the world. This International Research Experiences for Students (IRES) project will support 18 students over three years working on ATLAS experiment of LHC at CERN.  This project is focused on the largest university system in the country with 23 campuses and a total student population of ~490,000. Because CSU has very large minority and first-generation college student populations, student recruitment in this project will attract underrepresented as well as female students.  <br/><br/>The CSU students will validate the ATLAS Monte Carlo simulations, improve ATLAS software packages, and work on searching for new physics from ATLAS data. On ATLAS detector upgrades, the students will work on the installation, operation, and data analysis of ATLAS pixel detector, and improving software packages in monitoring various inner detector components. On ATLAS Trigger and Data Acquisition (DAQ), the students will install and test Fast Tracker (FTK) boards, improve and optimize FTK variable resolution patterns, and conduct offline and online testing of FTK performance. The students will also attend the renowned CERN Summer Student Lecture Series given by top physicists from all over the world. Upon returning to the US, student participants will give colloquia, seminars, and invited talks at CSU campuses, high schools, and local communities about their ATLAS research work and the CERN summer experience. Through the CSU Fresno PHYS 168S (?Physics Outreach?) course, the ATLAS students in PHYS 168S will visit at least two new K-12 classrooms each week to teach kinds about the CSU ATLAS and IRES programs and encourage them to pursue science.

Followed by skin cancer, prostate cancer is the most common cancer in American men. The American Cancer Society's estimate for prostate cancer in the United States for 2018 was 164,690 new cases. Most of these cases will receive radiotherapy as part of their treatment. The new trend in RT is to deliver a much higher dose of radiation per fraction in a smaller number of fractions while reducing the required number of RT sessions. However, during RT of the prostate, the rectum acts as a limiting factor. Due to the proximity of rectum to prostate, increasing dosage of the radiation can affect the rectal wall and increase risk of cancer in rectum. The device developed here allows for the expedited treatment plans while eliminating the undesirable damage to the rectal tissue.  This can greatly improve a patient's quality of life after completion of radiation treatment. The use of our device reduces the overall required time for the radiation therapy of prostate cancer and saves money for health care providers, health insurances, and patients.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project leverages the functionality of nickel titanium to retract the rectum away from the prostate during radiation beam therapy of prostate cancer. This will be a minimally invasive device that uses the biomimetic actuation of the material to create distance between rectum and prostate. NiTi as a biocompatible shape memory alloy is an ideal candidate for biomimetic and biocompatible devices. A control systems design is combined with thermomechanical functionality of the alloy to generate the desired range of motion and profile of force. The actuation takes place by passing a small electrical current in a reliable, clean, and silent manner. This type of actuation is potentially inherently safer when compared to most other means of actuation, because it has a limited range of motion beyond which applying more electrical current does not create further motion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In today's defense-in-depth security strategy, all available security controls are placed in series aiming to protect a device from malicious cyber-physical attack.  Market research estimates that the IoT market will reach over $500B by 2021 and security is considered one of the biggest barriers in adopting IoT.  One main reason of this security concern is due to the limited resource of IoT devices that makes it difficult to apply all layers of security protections. The adoption of the proposed approach will provide additive security layer to the IoT devices that will boost the confidence in IoT device security in cameras, drones, sensors and others. Consequently, it may induce new industries which have previously been reluctant to apply IoT solutions to their businesses. Due to the small resource occupation of the proposed device security, even non-IoT industries may apply the proposed approach to their security applications.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project applies Stochastic Computing (SC) to provide hardware Host Intrusion Detection System (HIDS) security solution for resource limited IoT devices. Current approaches to IoT security cannot provide HIDS solution to these resource constraint IoT devices, thereby missing out from one of the important layers in defense-in-depth security strategy. The proposed approach exploited two salient properties of SC: 1) consumption of less silicon area and power, 2) both SC and HIDS are inherently probabilistic in nature. SC is generated probabilistically from conventional number system that can perform complex mathematical operation using simple hardware blocks. The proposed approach provides IoT devices with HIDS based on simple hardware together with Machine Learning Neural Network Algorithm. Coupled with other security layers such as cryptography, access control etc., this light weight hardware solution provides strong security to the resource limited IoT devices. Embedded inside the IoT device, this HIDS monitors the incoming packets for any malicious activity and offers the last important layer of security defense.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Though AI is a quickly emerging field of research with broad applications in the STEM workforce and industry generally, there are few curriculum standards or educational guidelines for introducing pre-college students to fundamental knowledge and skills relating to the field of AI.  This project will address the emerging need for greater guidance in this field by bringing together specialists in AI from academia and industry with specialists representing K-12 education to draft guidelines for teaching and learning about AI across the grade bands of K-12 schools. The draft guidelines will then be reviewed by a larger interest group representing specialists in AI and computer science, as well as representatives of K-12 educators more broadly and the general public. Feedback from this larger interest group will be used to refine the guidelines for broader dissemination.  In addition to  developing initial guidelines for AI education at the pre-college level, the project will create an online directory of resources that can be used by K-12 teachers to develop instructional experiences in AI for their students.<br/><br/>The project team is working in association with the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) and the Computer Science Teachers Association (CSTA) to model AI guidelines after CSTA's K-12 Computer Science Standards released in 2017.

The University of Bamberg operates a Smart City Living Laboratory throughout the university and the city of Bamberg, Germany that is able to collect information such as noise levels, CO2 levels, and the number of people in a particular area from sensors throughout the city.  Smart cities collect information and process it to help decision makers make better decisions with a fuller understanding of the complex interactions of people and services in a city.  Some of the information comes from sources that are considered trustworthy such as CCTV cameras deployed by city workers; however, these trustworthy sources are often expensive to set up and maintain.  Crowd sourcing the information provides a cheaper and often more efficient way of obtaining information; however, since people can lie or malicious software could lie on their behalf, this information is significantly less trustworthy.  <br/>Our research examines the interactions between all of the entities in such a smart city environment and develops methods for utilizing crowd sourced information while protecting the city from malicious users and protects users from people who might spy on them through their data.  Researchers will be implementing and testing their work in the Living Lab Bamberg in Germany to validate the effectiveness of our security systems.  It is expected that this work will result in safer, more intelligent smart cities with the potential to improve energy efficiency, communication, transportation, and public health.<br/><br/>This project will address several scientific challenges in the security and privacy of smart cities. The site at the University of Bamberg was chosen due to the smart city living laboratory that the university operates on both the campus and city.  The researchers will address the following three scientific challenges:  <br/>i) Utilization of data from untrusted sources is critical because many of the data sources in a smart city are the smart phones of users who can intentionally manipulate data or who might have malware on their phone that is strategically manipulating data.  Students will build defense mechanisms using a combination of game theory and machine learning. <br/>ii) Privacy of users is critical to the adoption of crowd sensing for use in a smart city and to prevent the abuse of the system by users and administrators alike.  Students will build privacy-enhancing technologies that use realistically generated cover traffic to obfuscate user data and cyber-physical correlation to enable privacy-preserving audits of the data collected by the city. <br/>iii)   Secure incentives help to protect the deployers of tasks from malicious users that are seeking to optimize their gain without contributing to the system.  To ensure that malicious users do not exploit the incentive system, students will create spatio-temporal models of context information that detect if a user was actually at the location at the time they reported they were when contributing information.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The impacts of roads are most evident in Arctic and Subarctic regions, which are characterized by increased economic activity, an extremely fragile environment, and Indigenous villages often dependent on subsistence activities. In many remote Arctic regions, formal roads are rare, and transportation infrastructure consists predominantly of trails and paths established by Indigenous people for subsistence purposes as well as temporary roads laid out for resource exploration. Although such informal roads are usually unchartered, the impacts of the development and implementation of these informal roads have yet to be significantly explored.<br/><br/>This project is a detailed interdisciplinary analysis of the overall impact of informal transportation routes on the Arctic socioecological system. The expected project results will contribute to planning for sustainable development of Arctic and Subarctic regions, which are experiencing unprecedented anthropogenic and climate-induced changes. It will also generate scientific knowledge for complex assessment of the positive and negative impacts of development and tourism on other remote regions of the world. This goal will be addressed through the following project objectives: 1) Map and analyze the evolution of spatial extent and condition of formal and informal roads using a range of remote sensing products, archival work, and local knowledge; 2) Assess the importance and use of different types of roads for diverse population groups using field observations and in-depth interviews; 3) Provide an integrative assessment of the informal roads' impacts on socio-economic  and environmental conditions of local communities; and 4) Work closely with local communities to develop plan for sustainable development and use of transportation infrastructure.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Catalysts are critical to the chemical and pharmaceutical industries where they are used to reduce energy requirements of chemical processes and to orient precise chemical transformations. Many of the most active catalysts are based on rare metals that are quite costly and difficult to find and isolate. An important area of current research seeks to find cheap, abundant replacements for these expensive catalysts. Phosphorus (P) is an abundant, inexpensive element. However, there has been little effort made to devise catalysts based on it. Dr. Matthew Cain, Department of Chemistry, University of Hawaii at Manoa, is supported by the Chemical Synthesis Program of the Chemistry Division, to prepare unusual compounds where phosphorus atoms are in unusual oxidation states and may behave like metals under certain circumstances. Thus, phosphorus may represent an alternative to the rare, expensive metal catalysts currently being used.  This research may lead to highly unusual catalysts which could have transformative impact - replacing expensive and toxic platinum group metals in major industrial and pharmaceutical reactions.  In addition, this project includes an educational component that is designed to attract Native Hawaiian students into science. Native Hawaiians, although they constitute a sizable fraction of the population in the State of Hawaii, are very underrepresented in science and technology. Thus, this aspect of the projects provides an important, new opportunity to the Native Hawaiian population. <br/><br/><br/>Using monoanionic pincers featuring an equatorial carbon-aryl donor and electron-withdrawing axial donors, hypervalent 10-P-3 species with the correct frontier orbital environment to promote oxidative addition are prepared.

To overcome this roadblock, the investigative team will study computational thermal imaging, where novel end-to-end systems are designed with infrared optics and vision algorithms. These topics are usually studied separately. This research program will be integrated into a sequence of newly designed courses in computer vision and computational imaging at the University of California, Los Angeles.<br/><br/>This project brings computational imaging to the realm of long-wave infrared wavelengths and studies the unique performance tradeoffs thereof. The research rests upon three pillars. In the first pillar, the investigative team will construct a 3D camera prototype that projects custom-designed structured light patterns at long-wave infrared wavelengths (circa 10 micrometer wavelengths of light). The structured light patterns may be specialized to the unique characteristics of long-wave infrared wavelengths. In the second pillar, the investigative team will probe deeper into the possibility of non-line-of-sight cameras that operate at long-wave infrared wavelengths. Creating a camera that can see around corners sounds like a daunting challenge, but the investigative team aims to exploit the specularity of reflections that are unique to long-wave infrared wavelengths. Finally, the investigative team will study the foundational differences between how scientists mathematically represent image data at long-wave infrared wavelengths as compared to visible light wavelengths.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The vast number of studies on AV hinge upon assumptions on how AVs behave with respect to other vehicles.  Unfortunately, few of the assumptions can be empirically validated due to the absence of AVs. And yet, a critical component of AV technologies, the adaptive cruise control (ACC), has been used for over a decade and can be used to fill this gap.  The research aims to study how vehicles with ACC behave when interacting with other vehicles on the road. The research will provide important insights on the behaviors of AVs in the future. The understandings gained from this research will also have important implications in traffic management, transportation planning, and design of ACC vehicles and AV.  Additionally, this project will engage in a range of integrated research, educational and outreach activities, including sharing the ACC data with the research and practice community, developing educational modules, and K-12 outreach through summer camp. <br/><br/>More specifically, the research will (i) collect empirical trajectory data of ACC vehicles of different car-makers and their counterparts, regular vehicles (RVs), and (ii) formulate car-following models that capture the similar and differentiating features of ACCs and RVs.  The project will focus on data collection and model estimation efforts using Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE). This enables the novel applications of statistical inference methods (e.g., the likelihood ratio test) to test various hypotheses to assess the differences and similarities among different ACC systems and between ACCs and RVs. In particular, the research will test if ACC systems from different car-makers differ from one another and from the RVs, and if they change substantially over time. Knowing this is important because it will dictate whether or not future research in this area has to focus on analyzing each individual carmaker, or if ACC systems will eventually converge towards human-like driving.   In the modeling efforts, the research will build a general stochastic model so that the behaviors of ACC vehicles and RVs can be reconciled.  The research will examine different variations of the distributions of the model components to specify the model(s) and use MLE for estimation of model parameters.  Additionally, the research will use the estimated model(s) of the tested ACCs to extrapolate the results to the general mixed traffic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These relations can be represented as networks with both positive and negative links (or signed networks).  Signed networks have substantially different properties and principles from unsigned ones, which poses tremendous challenges to traditional network analysis and requires dedicated efforts. Thus a systematic and comprehensive investigation on signed networks is desired. The results of this project can have an immediate and strong impact on improving the performance of various network analytical tasks, enabling the analysis of networks with negative links, and thus positively impacting the overall value of various data/information areas. The developed new algorithms for signed network analysis will have impact on various disciplines, including computer science, social science, health informatics, and education as signed networks are very common in these domains. This project will play an integral part to attract undergraduate and K-12 students especially underrepresented groups to careers in engineering, to inform them about crucial but highly unavailable network analysis technologies and to encourage and train computer science and engineering graduate and undergraduate students to address research issues in network analysis.<br/><br/>The added complexity of negative links in signed networks has manifested unprecedented research challenges and opportunities. This project will comprehensively investigate the primary directions of signed networks from modeling and measuring to mining.  Each direction will dramatically extend the frontier through not only developing innovative solutions, but also studying original problems.  The core intellectual merit lies in the fact that the project offers the first systematic investigation on this emerging research area and the designed advanced methodologies and novel tasks will deepen our understanding on how negative links can be synergized to advance the field of network analysis; improve our knowledge of real-world networks; and contribute to real-world applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With increasing threats to Native lands and traditions, there is an urgent need to promote ecological sustainability awareness and opportunities among all stakeholders within and beyond the impacted areas. This is especially true among the dozens of tribes and over 50,000 members of the Coast Salish Nations in the Pacific Northwest United States. The youth within these communities are particularly vulnerable. This Innovations in Development project endeavors to address this serious concern by implementing a multidimensional, multigenerational model aimed at intersecting traditional ecological knowledge with contemporary knowledge to promote: (a) environmental sustainability awareness, (b) increased STEM knowledge and skills across various scientific domains, and (c) STEM fields and workforce opportunities within Coast Salish communities. Building on results from a prior pilot study, the project will be grounded on eight guiding principles. These principles will be reflected in all aspects of the project including an innovative, culturally responsive toolkit, curriculum, museum exhibit and programming, workshops, and a newly established community of practice.  If successful, this project could provide new insights on effective mechanisms for not only promoting STEM knowledge and skills within informal contexts among Coast Salish communities but also awareness and social change around issues of environmental sustainability in the Pacific Northwest.<br/><br/>Over a five-year period, the project will build upon an extant curriculum and findings codified in a pilot study. Each aspect of the pilot work will be refined to ensure that the model established in this Innovations and Development project is coherent, comprehensive, and replicable.  Workshops and internships will prepare up to 200 Coast Salish Nation informal community educators to implement the model within their communities. Over 2,500 Coast Salish Nation and Swinomish youth, adults, educators, and elders are expected to be directly impacted by the workshops, internships, curriculum and online toolkit. Another 300 learners of diverse ages are expected to benefit from portable teaching collections developed by the project.  Through a partnership with the Washington State Burke Natural History Museum, an exhibit and museum programming based on the model will be developed and accessible in the Museum, potentially reaching another 35,000 people each year. The project evaluation will assess the extent to which the following expected outcomes are achieved: (a) increased awareness and understanding of Indigenous environmental sustainability challenges; (b) increased skills in developing and implementing education programs through an Indigenous lens; (c) increased interest in and awareness of the environmental sciences and other STEM disciplines and fields; and (d) sustainable relationships among the Coast Salish Nations. A process evaluation will be conducted to formatively monitor and assess the work. A cross cultural team, including a recognized Coast Salish Indigenous evaluator, will lead the summative evaluation.

Solar panel manufacturing depends heavily on conductive pastes in the manufacture of the conductive busbars and finger grids on the top of solar panels, with the market potential for the conductive pastes being currently estimated to be about $2 billion and its growth at a CAGR of 4%.  With silver components accounting for close to 20% of the current photovoltaic solar cell costs, 100-fold cheaper copper pastes can substantially reduce the manufacturing cost.  New materials developments have led to increases in copper paste sales and usages. Commercialization of this technology offers an opportunity to accelerate the demand for solar panels by supplying high-performance conductive pastes to solar panel manufacturers at attractive prices.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project focuses on determining the commercialization feasibility of a high performance and low-cost copper nanowire paste technology to help photovoltaic solar panel manufacturers who suffer from the pain of high-cost silver paste that requires high processing temperature and is subject to corrosion of silver grid fingers to degrade the electrical performance. Customer discovery will be performed to test a number of initial hypotheses, identify the market opportunity, and develop the business model.  Manufacturing of silicon-based solar cells involves screen printing of conductive silver pastes as front electrodes to provide good contact and efficient electrical performance. Major barriers include high cost of silver, high-temperature manufacturing process and corrosion of silver grid fingers.

To overcome these challenges coupled natural-human systems approaches and analyses are needed. These provide improved scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services that couple the outputs of direct and indirect drivers such as land use, invasive species, overexploitation, biodiversity, environmental change, and pollution. The resulting models provide a methodological state-of-the art that results in more accurate quantitative assessments, better land use, and more effective ecosystem services. This international collaborative research project uses this methodology to develop scenarios of biodiversity and ecosystem services for selected floodplains of muddy (i.e., whitewater) rivers in the central Amazon region and their adjacent uplands. Amazon floodplains were selected because they are typical of tropical river floodplains that support high levels of biodiversity and provide fundamental services, such as water purification, fish habitat, and flood mitigation.  Like other tropical river systems, the Amazon sustains the livelihoods of many indigenous and poverty-stricken human populations and its flood plains are being increasingly threatened by development such as dams, agriculture, ranching, the expansion of road and rail networks, and climate change. For example, in the lower Amazon over half of the floodplain forest cover has been lost since the late 1970s. This project studies the floodplains of two contrasting major whitewater rivers: The Amazon River (Brazil and Colombia) and its tributary the Jurua River (Brazil). The research begins with working with stakeholders in a collaborative planning process that reflects local concerns and priorities and builds off local knowledge of the area. Work involves mapping targeted floodplains and adjacent upland habitats using remote sensing and field data. Goals are to predict changes in flooding patterns under climate change scenarios and model the interactions among biodiversity, habitat type, hydrology, and management regimes, with results being disseminated to stakeholders and the broader scientific community. Broader impacts of the work include international collaboration with scientists in Brazil, Columbia, France, Norway, Germany and the United Kingdom and improved understanding of how human activities along the floodplains of tropical rivers impact fisheries, food security, water quality, and biodiversity. Other broader impacts include development of a template for habitat and biodiversity assessment and for participatory planning that can be applied and adapted to similar types of river floodplains across tropical landscapes.

The earthquake took place in the upper part of a subducting slab where the slab may be bending downwards, and early indications suggest that the event was related to stresses caused by plate bending.  In the weeks and months following a large earthquake, slip and deformation can continue to take place along a tectonic plate boundary.  To better understand that nature of this deformation, this study would place five continuous GPS (global positioning system) stations near the earthquake epicenter, as well as record campaign GPS measurements at other local benchmark locations.  Data from this study could be used to better understand the behavior along the Denali fault and improve constraints on local seismic hazards.  <br/><br/>This project focuses on constraining postseismic deformation due to the magnitude 7 Anchorage earthquake, a normal faulting event within the Yakutat flat slab, including how coseismic and postseismic deformation may trigger changes in slip along the subduction interface. To achieve this, five new continuous GPS sites will be installed in the near-field of the earthquake and repeat campaign surveys will be conducted at benchmarks throughout the region. These measurements will provide a dataset that will be able to more completely characterize postseismic deformation, variations in locking and creeping behavior on the subduction interface, and potential triggered slow slip events.  The effect of intraslab normal-faulting earthquakes on upper plate deformation, coupling along the subduction interface, and transient events on the interface is not well understood.   Coseismic displacements recorded at continuous GPS sites show a complex deformation pattern and the location of the event make it likely that viscoelastic relaxation in the asthenosphere will occur.  Aftershocks recorded in the first weeks after the earthquake roughly delineate a horizontal surface, suggesting that the events may be occurring at or near the plate interface. The main shock occurred within a region that has experienced multi-year slow slip events in the past and studies in other subduction zones suggest that such regions are more prone to triggered slow-slip events after an earthquake. Along the eastern limit of the Yakutat flat slab, a postseismic study of the 2002 Denali earthquake suggested that that event may have caused long-term changes of the coupling along that section of the subduction interface. The sparseness of GPS sites within the aftershock zone makes it likely that transient changes on the underlying interface may go undetected and that postseismic deformation and changes in the coupling along the interface may not be able to be fully characterized. Data collected from the proposed new network of continuous GPS added to the data from existing continuous GPS and repeat surveys at campaign benchmarks will allow an evaluation of these signals at a more temporally and spatially dense scale than is currently possible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computerized therapies offer more intensive instruction at lower cost, but existing programs do not fully address the language deficits seen in autism. In addition, the National Council for Education Statistics reports a population of English as a Second Language (ESL) students that grew from 8.1 percent in 2000 to 9.5 percent in 2015.

These targeted language structures gradually increase in length and complexity. Learners construct their responses from scratch through open-ended word-button clicking, keyboard typing, or speech. The system provides interactive, step-by-step feedback (both spoken and written) that is informed by principles of explicit and implicit learning.

In addition to providing melt water, the forests also provide goods and services valued by society, including timber production, carbon sequestration, biodiversity preservation, nutrient interception, and water exchange to the atmosphere. To sustain these ecosystem services, forest management practices (FMPs) such as mechanical thinning, gap creation, and firebreak cutting are often implemented. However, these FMPs can have unintended consequences, including increased snow melt and peak flow that can cause erosion, destabilize streams, produce water shortages, and degrade water quality and ecosystem health. Water and forest managers need to strike a balance between maximizing forest productivity and minimizing impacts on water resources. This project will study the role of altered forest configurations due to FMPs on peak and melt-season streamflow in snow-dominated forests. The results will lead to mitigation of harmful hydrologic impacts from both natural and managed forest alterations and enhance the resilience of economies in the western U.S. and other areas supported by snow-fed water from these forests. Research and education will be integrated across multiple educational levels. K-12 outreach will be achieved through the Decision Room, a group simulation exercise to: 1) develop knowledge around specific water topics and 2) understand trade-offs involved in decision making and implementation of science-based solutions. The Decision Room will be implemented in collaboration with Morehead Planetarium Science Center at the North Carolina Science Festival, which has a history of engaging a very diverse student population. At the university level, data and models developed in this project will be integrated into courses on Water Quantity and Quality Assessment. Educational activities in North Carolina public schools, at Duke University and at the University of Idaho, will inspire a new generation of scientists and engineers to explore, collaborate and teach. <br/><br/>      The project will develop an improved understanding of how FMPs, such as thinning and gap creation, impact snow accumulation, snowmelt, and the consequent hydrologic response. The research will advance integrated assessment of radiation transfer, snow accumulation and melt, and the consequent hydrologic response in forested watersheds, through synergistic observation and modeling. Specifically, the project will: 1) develop, validate, and evaluate a physics-based forest radiation model for heterogeneous forests and 2) assess the impacts of changes in forest patch and gap configuration on hydrologic response, by integrating the radiation model with a snow melt and accumulation model and a distributed hydrologic model. Hypothesis testing, and parameterization, evaluation, and validation of the models will be performed at multiple sites including the Mica Creek Experimental Watershed (Idaho), Southern Sierra Critical Zone Observatory (California) and Niwot Ridge Long Term Ecological Research site (Colorado). The validated model will evaluate existence of optimal forest patch and gap configurations that may either minimize the negative impacts of FMPs or enhance hydrologic benefits. The integrated model developed during the project, to be released to the broader community, will allow robust hydrology impact analyses for forest alteration scenarios and provide a foundation for testing future sustainable water resource and forest management strategies."

Advanced game-theoretic models and algorithms have been developed for analyzing threats in such scenarios that can be described as having attackers and defenders. These techniques have been effective in helping defenders allocate resources to defend against threats.  Now, in a modern information environment dominated by social networks and increased connectivity in all aspects of life, defenders will need to consider the influence of the ""information hubs"" (IHs) in that environment that collect, process and disseminate information.  IHs include all sorts of connected devices in the growing ""Internet of Things"", as well as the people in the social networks.  This project aims to design new game theoretic models that account for the influence of IHs on attacker-defender interactions and develop methods to help the defender optimally select and allocate IHs for best defensive effect. This project will also develop methods to find the optimal allocation of defensive units given the presence of IHs so that the defender can achieve maximal benefit with minimal resources.<br/>  <br/>Towards gaining a full understanding of the role of IHs in adversarial settings, the researchers will (1) develop new game-theoretic approaches that extend models such as Stackelberg security games to allow the IHs to communicate with the agents; (2) theoretically analyze the computational complexity of optimally selecting and allocating IHs to maximize the defender's expected utility in the game, and provide Mixed Integer Linear Programming (MILP)-based solution approach to compute the optimal selection and allocation, as well as approximation schemes and heuristic algorithms for large-scale problem instances; and (3) develop MILP-based algorithms to compute robust strategies against uncertainties in information collection, processing and dissemination.

Most of the damage and fatalities were caused by violent tornadoes spawned by supercell thunderstorms, with six tornadoes receiving EF5 rankings, the most violent category of the Enhanced Fujita scale.  Last year, several outbreaks occurred with over 140 confirmed tornadoes rated between EF2 and EF4 that resulted in substantial damage and over 30 deaths. While significant advances in our knowledge of supercell thunderstorms and tornadoes have occurred in recent decades, understanding of the fundamental processes occurring within supercells that result in tornadoes remains elusive. This void in knowledge is especially concerning for violent tornadoes that are responsible for a disproportionate number of fatalities and injuries as well as damage. Until these tornado genesis and maintenance processes are understood, our ability to forecast such events is severely limited. The primary goal of this research is to improve the fundamental understanding of processes underlying the formation and maintenance of tornadoes in supercell thunderstorms, especially as these processes relate to violent tornadoes. This knowledge is critical for improving tornado forecasts, tornado warning lead times, and estimations of potential tornado strength and longevity, and is especially applicable to tornadoes of strong and violent intensity. In conjunction with an awarded NSF grant providing continued access to the NSF-funded Blue Waters supercomputer, the research will analyze petabytes of data to study the processes occurring in supercells that result in tornadoes of varying strength, longevity, and structure.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit:<br/>Despite advances in observational and modeling/computing technology, much still needs to be understood about the evolution of tornadoes. Few computer simulations exist in which a well-resolved tornado forms within its parent supercell, and this work uses the highest resolution simulations of violently tornadic supercells conducted to date. A control simulation with 30 meter grid spacing has been completed where twenty fields in a volume centered on the tornado during its entire life cycle have been saved to disk every model time step, which will facilitate the most accurate analysis possible. 20 m and 15 m simulations containing long-track EF5 tornadoes have also been completed, and additional runs at these resolutions will be executed as needed. Tools to efficiently interrogate and analyze model data saved every time step will be improved and new tools will be developed. New simulations will be conducted in other environments in which violent tornadoes were observed. By analyzing simulated storms in different environments and comparing tornadogenesis failure cases to cases where violent tornadoes occur, the research team aims to identify processes common within unusually violent supercells involved in the formation and maintenance of tornadoes.<br/><br/>Broader Impacts:<br/>A better fundamental understanding of tornado development in supercell thunderstorms should help guide future field programs in which new features identified in these numerical simulations are targeted for study, and ultimately lead to improvements in our ability to accurately forecast significant tornadic events and increase tornado warning lead times. Improving our fundamental understanding of tornado maintenance, made possible through analysis of the simulations described, should provide insight critical for National Weather Service forecasters to better predict, once a tornado has developed, how long a particular tornado may last. This type of information is invaluable, especially when pertaining to high-end, long-track events. The improved understanding of tornadoes in addition to cutting-edge visualizations of this research will facilitate science education in forums ranging from formal courses for students to learning venues for the general public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Applications range from manipulating thermal and electronic transport in solids to controlling information propagation in a quantum network that behaves like an interacting quantum system. Non-equilibrium dynamics is however not very well-understood in certain quantum materials, especially for those with strong interactions between constituents. To gain precise knowledge on the quantum dynamics of interest, a quantum material with precise local probes and control is highly desired. This CAREER award supports an experimental research and education program to assemble a designer quantum material for the exploration of elusive non-equilibrium quantum dynamics. The proposed material consists of an array of cold neutral atoms, each cooled to its quantum mechanical ground state, and controlled by novel potentials formed by optical, phononic and nanophotonic lattices to mimic various types of quantum materials. The project aims at inducing and probing a variety of quantum dynamical phenomena not previously realized. Success in this project will lead to advancement in controlling atomic quantum materials and in deeper understanding of quantum many-body and statistical physics. Due to broad experimental techniques involved in this research program, the project will provide solid research training for both graduate and undergraduate students. Furthermore, in collaboration with the Purdue Physics and Astronomy Outreach office, the project will initiate a secondary-grade outreach program aimed at improving the learning capital and STEM career orientation of underrepresented minority students.<br/><br/>Technical summary<br/>This CAREER award supports an experimental research and education program to explore non-equilibrium dynamics in an atomic quantum gas using a state-of-the-art cold atom toolbox for optical, phononic, and nanophotonic lattice engineering. One thrust of this CAREER project is probing quantum critical dynamics of an atomic quantum gas in an optical lattice. In particular, the PI will employ a new experimental scheme to access a superfluid-to-Mott insulator quantum critical point, enabling various ways to explore critical thermodynamics and transport problems that have remained elusive to date. Furthermore, the PI will explore quasiparticle control to engineer a phononic band gap crystal in a superfluid quantum gas that can inhibit phonon transport, just as electronic band gaps do to electrons in solid state crystals. It can be engineered to manipulate thermal and entropy transport in a superfluid sample. The PI will perform dynamical control of the phononic crystals, therefore allowing for the exploration of phononic analogues of electrodynamics phenomena. For a long-term goal of this CAREER project on probing novel quantum dynamics, the PI will aim at further integrating ultracold atoms with nanophotonic lattices to form a designer hybrid material, where the atom-surface Casimir-Polder interaction provides a deep subwavelength lattice potential for entering new regimes of quantum dynamics. Success in this project will advance our knowledge in understanding quantum critical dynamics, provide valuable insights to quantum transport in phononic bandgap materials, and potentially lead to the observation of unexpected new quantum phenomena with a designer hybrid quantum material. The broad experimental techniques involved in this research program will provide solid research training for both graduate and undergraduate students.

While deformation has been studied for decades, deformable simulation is notorious for its costly computation. With the rapid development of sophisticated sensing devices and acquisition techniques, the complexities, scales and dimensionalities of the data have grown exponentially, and large-scale geometries are becoming ubiquitous in modern 3D data processing. Even with state-of-the-art hardware, a massive deformable simulation can still take hours, days, or even weeks. In this era of data explosion, increasing demands on both computing efficiency and simulation realism impose unprecedented challenges on this classic computing problem, so game-changing algorithmic techniques for large-scale, complex, and nonlinear deformable models are needed to empower future graphics applications.  If successful, this project will not only expand the frontier of physics-based simulation technologies, but also profoundly inspire broader computing communities beyond graphics and enable a variety of applications. <br/><br/><br/>During a deformable simulation, a nonlinear system needs to be repetitively solved in order to track the continuous shape evolution of the deforming body. A deformable object with complex geometry could house a large number of unknown degrees of freedom, and the resulting high-dimensional integration becomes prohibitive. To overcome this problem, this project will develop a re-branded deformable model which systematically integrates advanced simulation techniques and deep learning (DL) tools, specifically deep neural networks (DNNs). The hypothesis is that digital simulation provides us nearly unlimited noise-free training data, which should be fully exploited and leveraged to benefit unseen yet difficult simulation or computing challenges. Unlike existing data-driven methods that interpret the data with a closed-form formulation (e.g., using a convex interpolation), DNNs provide a universal mechanism to extract intrinsic features hidden behind the raw data in an end-to-end manner, and have already demonstrated significant outcomes in many long-standing computer vision problems like object detection, classification, and annotation. However, harnessing DL in physics-based simulation is not easy. While in theory one may still encode all of these parameters using a very high-dimensional input vector, the corresponding network would be extremely large and complex. Even if we manage to collect sufficient training data to optimize this net, a single forward pass of it may be slower than a conventional simulator, making DL completely unprofitable. In this project, we will thoroughly investigate those grand technical challenges, forge a collection of data structures and algorithmic techniques for the data-driven deformable simulation, and thereby pave the way for DL-based physics simulation to next-generation computer graphics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to better understand the causes and consequences of damage memory in convection. Funding will support a female graduate student and speak to issues outside geodynamics including the quest for a general law describing fault behavior from the seismic cycle to long-term Earth evolution.

Incorporating such rheological memory will allow study of the full range of tectonic behavior, including how plate boundary evolution and plate motions are linked with the deep mantle. A range of viscous damage formulations will be explored and benchmarked against grain-size evolution theories and other suggested mechanisms for strain-localization, such as formation of shear bands and mechanical anisotropy due to lattice preferred orientation of olivine. Model results will be compared with geological constraints including plate kinematics, with particular focus on the time-dependence of plate boundary geometry, plate speeds and sizes, and seafloor age distributions.

Sampling density will be 100 km, resolvable by ice sheet models. The investigator will address two primary questions: 1) What are the spatiotemporal patterns of Arctic NW LIS deglaciation and was retreat monotonic or were their periods of accelerated retreat? And 2) Do Arctic NW LIS retreat-rate changes correspond with deglacial periods of Northern Hemisphere abrupt climate change, such as the Younger Dryas? The first question will be answered using beryllium ages, with the sampling approach able to resolve century-scale changes in ice-margin retreat. The second question will be addressed by comparing the timing of Arctic NW LIS retreat at the 11 sampling locations to abrupt climate events of the last deglaciation. To convert the ice-margin retreat record into changes in ice volume and meltwater discharge, the investigator will use the chronology to filter Bayesian deglacial LIS-model simulations, which will force sea-level/earth models and be compared to deglacial climate simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

After deployment, the system smartly learns complex scenarios and customizes to the user's environment based on unsupervised learning approach. The project builds upon prior work in hardware development for smart adaptive systems.   In general, for smart solutions, researchers mostly have employed supervised learning (training based) due to its simplicity. If this research is successful, it will advance the state-of-the-art in the unsupervised learning approach as well as GA based smart systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With these new methods, it is now possible to observe what people read and talk about, and thus think and feel about, a wide range of common objects and events. The goal of this project is to study how these novel methods and datasets can be combined with existing psychological theory to predict and understand human judgment, with the primary application to the domain of risk perception. The computational techniques proposed as part of this project allow for the automatic, large-scale analysis of the perception of naturalistic risks, and thus can be used to identify problems and develop interventions involving risk communication and risk management. More generally, by applying cutting edge methods in data science to the study of human behavior, this project develops novel technologies for predicting and understanding attitudes, beliefs, and preferences. By doing so, it facilitates a wide array of policy and commercial applications not feasible using existing empirical methodologies in the behavioral sciences.<br/><br/>How can we uncover and quantify rich mental representations for all of the objects and concepts that are the target of everyday judgment? How can we use these rich representations to predict judgments and judgment errors, to study domain and individual-level differences in judgment, and to characterize the complex web of associations that underlie judgment? Finally, how can we study differences in mental representations and judgments across cultures and time periods? This project will use ""semantic vectors"" -- high dimensional representations for words obtained from large-scale language data -- to address these questions. Semantic vectors provide a good proxy for the structure of knowledge and association in people's minds and can be combined with various machine learning algorithms to predict judgments for naturalistic objects and concepts, such as sources of risk. These vectors can also identify the key associates of judgments, facilitating directed hypothesis tests for a diverse array of psychological dimensions, including emotions, moral concepts, and personality. Finally, when trained on different types of language datasets, semantic vectors can shed light on the complex interaction between judgment and culture, history, and society. Note that semantic vectors can be used in this manner for nearly any judgment domain that involves common objects, individuals, and events. Thus one key goal of this project is to evaluate the applicability of semantic vectors for predicting and understanding the many different types of judgments that that people make on a day-to-day basis (including not only risk judgment, but also, for example, health judgment and consumer judgment).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sustainable development of the southwestern United States, including West Texas, critically depends on creative and efficient use of water resources, which are the most important natural resource to society. The transport of water at and below the surface plays a key role in the water cycle in arid and semi-arid environments. This grant from the National Science Foundation supports the purchase of a high-precision infrared laser spectrometer at Texas Tech University for isotopic analysis of water. This instrument will provide new research opportunities that will lead to better water conservation in these regions. It will also provide undergraduate, graduate and underserved minority students with opportunities to conduct scientifically and socially important research projects as part of their studies. <br/><br/>This grant from the National Science Foundation supports the acquisition of a high-precision infrared (IR) laser spectrometer at Texas Tech University for isotopic analysis of water. This instrument is capable of measuring, in addition to conventional &#948;2H and &#948;18O values, the 17O-excess, which is a novel, very useful tracer of water for diffusion-controlled hydrologic processes such as evaporation of water from surface and soil waters. Thus, a combined use of &#948;2H - &#948;18O -17O-excess values can help advance our understanding of the behavior and transport of water in arid and semi-arid zones. To date, high-precision 17O-excess measurements of water have been conducted only by a select few laboratories via highly skilled isotope ratio mass spectrometry. However, recent developments of commercial, high-precision water isotope analyzers enable routine, high-precision measurements of 17O-excess (<15 per meg), in addition to &#948;2H and &#948;18O values. The acquisition of this instrument will benefit several current and future isotope hydrology projects in West Texas and adjacent U.S. southwest regions, involving many researchers from Texas Tech University, and Federal and regional agencies.

These models learn to understand language from data, which can often be as simple as a collection of published books or a download of Wikipedia, rather than through any kind of manual engineering or hands-on guidance by linguistic expert. While modern machine learning methods are quite effective, they are not perfect. When they fail understand some text, it can be difficult to discover why, and even more difficult to craft interventions to address those failures. This CISE Research Initiation Initiative (CRII) project develops tools to help use methods and insights from research in linguistic science to analyze and refine machine learning systems for sentence understanding. The project should have a practical impact in making it easier to develop effective language technologies, a scientific impact in helping linguists use machine learning as a proxy to study human language learning, and a training impact in supporting several PhD students---through both research seminars and direct research collaborations---as they develop into experts in the interaction between linguistic science and language technology.<br/><br/>The methods used in this project relies on the human ability to judge the grammatical acceptability of a sentence; i.e., to decide whether someone could ever use a given sequence of words to say something. The project has three parts: (1) to build a large acceptability-based dataset for English which evaluates machine learning systems on their linguistic knowledge; (2) to use this data to evaluate widely-used standard approaches to machine learning for language, with a focus on promising recent approaches that use artificial neural networks learn from plain text; and (3) to develop methods for using small custom datasets to directly repair any gaps in the knowledge that these machine learning models acquire. Analyzing and improving artificial neural networks is difficult, since their internal representations of language are continuous and at least superficially, their internal representations of language do not at all resemble the kinds of representations that linguists use to analyze language. The investigators' methods are designed to minimize this difficulty, which rely on converging evidence from multiple ways of using the same data in its experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dramatic turns of events are key to recognizing and communicating effective reports or stories about events.  Autonomous systems will work more effectively with humans in obtaining and conveying such narrative when they too can recognize what is dramatic (or tragic, or comical) about human events.  The challenge is to effectively convey such concepts to a computer in such a way that humans and autonomous systems can effectively work together in this. This research studies how to direct a team of robots to obtain video footage to produce clips that trace a dramatic story arc. It is an examination of how such systems might achieve goals that people consider to be abstract or high-level. Within this project, the programs that command teams of robots must predict likely events, direct the robots to be in position for obtaining the desired footage, and re-plan based on observed events. This challenge encompasses a rich and previously unstudied class of problems for robot systems.  It will constitute a unique demonstration of robots that are capable of achieving high-level goals as they process data in forms which combine both continuous and discrete views of the world in a new and unusual way.  More broadly, the research will advance how computers can fuse and summarize video streams. Both skills are needed for automatically generating synopses and in editing videos. Obvious places where this is useful include helping secure the nation (for surveillance), taming the deluge of online multimedia content (for summarization), and advancing applications in the creative industries (for editing). The research project will also use the ideas underlying these pieces in a new robotics course with students at three institutions going head-to-head in a series of competition-based class projects. This course (taught, among other places, at a Hispanic-Serving Institution) will contribute to the development of the STEM workforce of the future, helping increase American competitiveness.<br/><br/>The project advances current knowledge by formulating new theory and developing novel algorithms for autonomous and robot systems, with a focus on those systems with minimal or no human operator intervention. The research contributes novel data representations for robots that will inhabit rich environments such as those characterized by uncertain, unanticipated, and dynamically changing circumstances. One of the foundational ideas of the project is a means to specify sophisticated mission objectives via a recursive structure using prior work in compiler theory for computer languages. The project involves a strong connection between this theoretical work and demonstrated systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Based conceptually on the way the human brain processes complex visual information by learning to selectively focus on the most salient elements, self-attention improves network ability to capture long-range relations in data. However, there is limited study in quantifying uncertainties of the outputs of self-attention networks, though uncertainty quantification is critically important for reliable learning models. The uncertainty of a self-attention network highly depends on where the network pays its attention to. This project will model the uncertainties associated with attention placement, and thereby better quantify the uncertainty in network outputs. The research will also convert part of the architecture design to standard computational procedures by utilizing statistical methods, and thus facilitate the design of new network architectures. This project has a secondary aim of applying the self-attention mechanism to statistical inference for computational efficiency. Ultimately, this project will produce new network architectures that are more reliable and more broadly applicable. This research will also support the development of a deep learning course for both graduate and undergraduate students at Tufts University. <br/><br/>This project examines self-attention networks using a Bayesian approach and proposes a new modification - Bayesian Self-Attention Networks (BSANs). While self-attention networks use ""attention weights"" to take information from a special range of the data, BSANs assign probabilities to attention weights. By modeling uncertainties in the attention, BSANs naturally inherit desirable properties of Bayesian methods, such as better estimations of uncertainties and less overfitting of data. BSANs will automate the computation of attention probabilities as statistical inference procedures, simplifying the design of new attention-based neural networks, which will only need to determine where to place the attention structure. The study of BSANs will result in new network architectures, with the potential to improve reliability over a wide span of tasks in both natural language processing and graph data analysis. In addition to BSANs, this project will also use the self-attention mechanism to construct probability distributions that involve large numbers of variables.

This dissertation is a step towards beginning to answer this call. Adult second language learners are often able to function at some level in a foreign language, but the influence of the native language during second language learning and use is known to negatively affect proficiency levels. Second language learners often experience the frustration of trying to remember a recently learned word in a second language, but only being able to retrieve the word in the native language. An important goal, then, is to learn to regulate interference from the native language to achieve higher proficiency in a second language. This project proposes to investigate how this might be possible. <br/><br/>The electrophysiological brain activity of English speakers who are learning Spanish will be measured during the learning of new word combinations, for example, ""despertar dudas.""  This collocation literally translates as ""awaken doubts"" but is expressed in English with the phrase ""raise doubts"". Using a word combination like ""despertar dudas"" requires the suppression of the English translation equivalent ""raise doubts"". This research project will examine the brain activity associated with learning in conditions that require ignoring interference from the native language to examine whether they lead to better learning and generalization when learners are exposed to new input.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The interactions between sensory and motor areas of the brain are particularly important for interacting with and reacting to the world around us. However, it is still unknown exactly how neural signaling from the sensory areas of the brain directly influence brain areas related to movement. The goal of this neuroscientific study is to understand how signals from sensory and motor areas of the cerebral cortex combine within a important subcortical area called the striatum to influence decision-making behavior in mice. Conducting the studies in mice allows for the use of innovative neuroscience technology for discovering the mechanistic basis of brain function on the level of synapses, neural circuits, and behavior. Classroom and outreach components of the project are designed to build on the technological and scientific themes of the research. A university course based on open source neurotechnology will enable students to achieve fluency in modern experimental neuroscience and skills they can use throughout their careers. The outreach program will strengthen ties with underrepresented minorities through international exchange with researchers in Mexico and through bilingual publications in a scientific journal for kids. Together, this project will advance our understanding and appreciation of brain function on multiple levels, from cutting-edge research and education to beneficial societal outreach. <br/><br/>The integration of sensory and motor information is critical for discriminating between different stimuli and making appropriate actions. This projects investigates how single neurons and neural circuits within key brain areas, such as the dorsal striatum, dynamically process sensory and motor input during behavioral performance and during learning. In the mouse whisker-related somatosensory system, axonal projections of primary sensory cortex (S1) and primary motor cortex (M1) combine at the level of the dorsal striatum, a structure known for its role in behavior through influence on the motor thalamus. The role of S1 in striatal function, and how S1 and M1 inputs combine, is unknown. Most previous work has focused on frontal cortex inputs to striatum, and therefore, our understanding of how sensorimotor integration takes place in striatum, and what its role is during behavior and learning are incomplete. The goal of this CAREER project is to determine the neural circuitries underlying S1 and M1 input to dorsal striatum, and to define their roles in behavior. The results will provide important knowledge of the distinct roles of S1- and M1-corticostriatal signaling in behavior. The education component promotes expertise in neurotechnology for undergraduate and graduate students, while outreach to underrepresented minorities builds on essential elements of the research program through international exchange and youth-focused bilingual publications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, currently an operator either teleoperates these vehicles directly or pre-specifies waypoint locations in a fixed plan. These approaches lead to severely limited performance by restricting the capabilities of robotic vehicles to (1) continue operating effectively as their environment, mission, and teammates change and (2) incorporate high-level goals given by human operators. This project seeks to bridge the gap between current systems that naively follow waypoints and intelligent systems capable of adapting to their environment, their team's capabilities, and to the goals of the operator. <br/><br/>The ultimate objective of this project is to develop topological planning techniques based on homotopy and persistent homology that reason over a compact semantic representation of environmental conditions (e.g., informative areas, disturbances, and risky areas). By reasoning over concise semantic maps, the proposed methods will enable teams of autonomous vehicles to make decisions regarding information collection, cost minimization, and goal achievement in the physical world. The developed algorithms will be made publicly available through open source distribution and transitioned to field tests through ongoing collaborations with ocean scientists.

Measuring all possible waves involves documenting their travel times and wave shape information.  These data can then be used to bolster seismic imaging efforts of Earth's mantle which currently do not routinely use multiple bouncing or echoing of waves, especially P waves. Using these waves ensures better sampling of the entire volume of the Earth's mantle.  Otherwise, the southern hemisphere in particular is poorly sampled.  Better imaging of Earth's mantle is important because it allows for more accurate determination of earthquake properties as well as the dynamic convection of the interior which drives plate tectonics at Earth's surface. A complete dataset of a subset of seismic waves will allow benchmarking tomographic models of different research groups, as well as permit a more direct comparison of P and S wave models of significant heterogeneities of the deep mantle.  In particular, this work will study two massive low seismic wave speed structures: one beneath the Pacific Ocean, and one beneath the Atlantic Ocean and Africa.  These huge structures are the largest anomalies in the planet which are unknown in nature.  Resulting models will be rendered in 3D and shared with the public via the 3D Marston Theater at Arizona State University, which regularly gives science shows to the general public.  The project will also support and train two students at ASU.  Training the undergraduate student will involve the creation and regular updating of a data acumen training document, which will also be shared via the web. Students will be involved in data analysis, interpretation, and writing papers to be published.   Scientific renderings (e.g., models and schematics) will be shared via the PI's website, as well as via direct email.<br/><br/>This project will measure and quantify travel time behavior of a global seismic dataset of high quality P-wave phases, S-wave phases on the SV component of motion , phases having both P and SV legs in the mantle, and depth phases of P, SH, SV, and P-SV waves. The adopted approach incorporates two novel tools recently developed: (1) empirical wavelets (EWs) are constructed from the average shape of S and P waves on an event-by-event basis, which are adaptively adjusted to match variable pulse widths prevalent in data, thus minimizing travel time estimation errors; and (2) virtual stations which are built from localized geographical bin stacks of stations for phases of interest, making measurements possible for data with event-station corridors typically too low in amplitude for confident measurements. The new seismic measurements proposed here will document travel times along with several attributes of all measured waveforms, including wave shape information (amplitude, waveform broadness, waveform misfit compared to the best fitting EW), signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs, measured multiple ways), and cross-correlation coefficients (CCCs, between phases of interest and best-fitting EWs). The investigators will measure minor and major arc data at relatively short periods (10-16 sec). The new datasets aim to improve resolution in P and S seismic imaging of the Earth's mantle, with the goal of improving understanding of the structure, dynamics, and evolution of the Earth. These data will improve wave path coverage in the southern hemisphere, be applicable to imaging studies of the entire mantle, and be made publicly available along with a recently completed SH dataset using the same methodology. The data will be used for imaging large-low velocity provinces, with a focus on comparing P and S velocity heterogeneity, which bears upon the nature of heterogeneity. This work will fund a PhD student and an undergraduate student to collect, process, measure, and review P and SV seismic data. The PI will mentor the students within a broader perspective of the multidisciplinary nature of mantle heterogeneity, particularly the dynamics and evolution of the mantle, with participation in ASU's multidisciplinary geophysics group (seismology, mineral physics, geodynamics, and planetary geophysics). All data measurements, models, and codes will be openly shared with the community via the web, as well as IRIS's tomography model portal.  All measurements will be shared with the 3D Reference Earth Model project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such sounds are often recorded many kilometers from a volcano and are used by scientists and observatories to continuously observe eruptions; commonly infrasound is used to detect explosions and to measure eruption intensity and character. This study's objective is to improve the understanding of how infrasound relates to eruptive processes occurring within a volcanic crater. To implement infrasound as an effective tool it is necessary to understand how the recorded sound signals are modulated by crater shape.  This work aims to measure, model, and quantify the influence of the crater's acoustic response, which influences the radiated sound much like the horn of a musical instrument. Measurements will include field work where the sound field is recorded both within and outside the craters of active volcanoes. Anticipated results will lead to improved modeling of eruptive processes and to better recognition of changes in volcanic unrest. This study will bring together a diverse international team spanning numerical, analytical, and field expertise from not just Idaho, but Hawaii, Chile, Italy, and the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The work will also fund graduate and undergraduate students, and contribute to exciting public outreach opportunities which include chronicling the efforts through a component of professional videographies.<br/><br/> <br/>The crater acoustic response is a transfer function, which relates source processes occurring at the bottom of a volcanic crater to the infrasound that is radiated to distant receivers. An understanding of the crater acoustic response is critical to improving utility of volcano infrasound recordings for both general monitoring and for improving physics-based eruption models. In cases where craters are deep and narrow and/or assymetric, the crater acoustic response can be particularly extreme and can significantly distort a source-time function. Deconvolution of the crater's acoustic response is thus critical to recovering accurate source-time functions. This study's integrated numerical modeling and field work, which incorporates large-N infrasound sampling, will permit robust quantification of the crater's sound modulation effects. Anticipated results will permit researchers to better infer source parameters and to invert for crater geometry, which may vary dynamically over time at active volcanoes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One key aspect is to understand how processes in the atmosphere, ocean, and sea ice interact and affect Arctic ocean sea ice behavior and distribution.  As part of the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) campaign, this project is deploying an ultra-wideband microwave radiometer to improve the ability to remotely determine sea ice thickness information. The long term measurements of sea ice available from MOSAiC's one year deployment of the RV Polarstern into an Arctic ice floe, combined with the extensive ice, ocean, and atmosphere in-situ measurements to be acquired, provide an optimal environment for sea ice monitoring studies, which in turn enable better models of sea ice evolution.  Those models are criticall important to advancing Arctic system science and predicting the future of the Arctic. Student training will also provide societal impact by preparing the next generation of researchers in polar science and observation.<br/><br/>The difficult conditions of the Arctic along with its spatially heterogeneous forcing motivate remote Earth observations from satellites or airborne platforms. Remote sensing systems have proven to be effective in monitoring sea ice extent and fractional cover, as well as sea ice thickness and type to a lesser extent. Current L-band (1.4-GHz) microwave radiometers and laser altimeters have limited sensitivity to ice thickness in the range from 0.5 to 2 meters, which is increasingly common as compared to thicker multi-year ice. An ability to sense sea ice temperature and salinity properties, and particularly their variations within the ice itself, could also provide important new benefits for understanding ice formation and dissolution.<br/><br/>The project is deploying a four channel ultra-wideband microwave radiometer observing from 0.5 to 2 GHz as part of the MOSAiC central observatory in order to acquire a unique dataset of ice thermal emissions and their variations with thickness and other ice properties. By measuring thermal emissions from sea ice at multiple frequencies, and frequencies lower than 1.4 GHz, more information on ice properties, and to greater depth, will be possible.  The measurements acquired will further play an important role in bridging between the point in situ measurements to be acquired by other MOSAiC program investigators and the approximately 9 m x 26 m instrument footprint that will provide ice properties averaged over the ""intermediate"" scales associated with ice floes. The three year project includes instrument preparation and planning in year one, campaign participation in year 2 (including staffing by project personnel during MOSAiC legs I and II), and extensive data analysis in year 3.<br/><br/>By advancing understanding of the spatial scaling between sea ice properties at point (in situ) and floe scales, the project will provide an important link to enable ""sub-grid-scale"" phenomena parameterization in sea ice forecast models. The time histories of thickness, salinity, and temperature acquired will also represent important datasets for characterizing the sea ice energy budget over relevant spatial scales. The advancement achieved in the use of passive microwave remote sensing will also provide new insights into the electromagnetic properties of sea ice for use in future development of new instrumentation and satellite observation methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bug-bounty programs provide unique benefits by allowing organizations to publicly signal their commitment to security and to harness the diverse expertise of thousands of security experts in an affordable way. Despite their rapidly growing popularity, bug-bounty programs are not well understood and can be mismanaged. As a result, bug bounty programs can waste substantial resources and they rarely live up to their potential to improve cybersecurity. This project will significantly improve the efficiency of bug-bounty programs by collecting and publishing comprehensive datasets on the bug-bounty ecosystem, by establishing a sound theory of bug-bounty programs, and by providing practical recommendations for organizations and regulators. The project will directly benefit organizations and companies by enabling them to manage bug-bounty programs more efficiently, which will allow them to eliminate security vulnerabilities at a lower cost, and it will also benefit users by improving the security of products and services.<br/><br/>The project will have four research thrusts. The first thrust will build a dataset that captures the entire bug-bounty ecosystem by collecting activity data and rule descriptions from public bug-bounty programs, conducting interviews and focus-group studies with experts who regularly participate in programs, collecting social-media posts, and incorporating existing datasets, such as vulnerability databases. The second thrust will analyze this dataset to understand the ecosystem and its actors' incentives and actions, and to characterize processes, such as discovering and reporting vulnerabilities and rewarding reports. To code textual data, the project will first develop a terminology and taxonomy of bug-bounty related concepts. Driven by the results of the data analysis, the third thrust will develop a formal model of the bug-bounty ecosystem, which will incorporate technological processes as well as behavioral and economic incentives. To capture all aspects of such a complex ecosystem, the project will employ models and techniques from multiple disciplines and areas, including economics and cybersecurity. Building on this model, the fourth thrust will propose and evaluate novel approaches for improving the efficiency and scalability of bug-bounty programs. The project will consider policies for individual bug-bounty programs, such as rules for rewarding vulnerability reports, as well as mechanisms for regulating bug-bounty programs and for instigating coordination between them.

A comprehensive and concerted research initiative is needed that can boost research on transformations to sustainability and catalyze new kinds of solutions to environmental and social challenges. <br/><br/>This award supports U.S. researchers participating in a project competitively selected by a 19-country initiative through the Belmont Forum- NORFACE-ISSC.  Transformations to Sustainability (T2S) is a multilateral initiative designed to support research projects that will contribute to re-structuring the broad field of sustainability research.  Co-production of knowledge and research problem formulation is considered to be critical to the process of societal transformation and each project engages stakeholders or community-based partners.  The initiative seeks to develop the fundamental knowledge societies require to help develop transformations to sustainability which are of significant social concern throughout the world and of great relevance to both academics and stakeholders.  The T2S program aims to build capacity, overcome fragmentation and have a lasting impact on both society and the research landscape by cultivating durable research collaboration across multiple borders, disciplinary boundaries, and with practitioners and societal partners. This includes facilitating the development of new research collaborations with parts of the world which are not often involved in large-scale international research efforts, notably low- and middle-income countries.  The funds provided in this award will be used to support U.S. participants to cooperate in consortia that consist of partners from at least three of the participating countries and that bring together natural scientists, social scientists and research users (e.g., civil society, NGOs, and industry).  Participants from other countries are funded through their national funding organizations. <br/><br/>This project seeks to develop a new model to provide sustainable pathways that can effectively balance the needs of natural ecosystems and those of human development.  The model will seek to develop (1) landscape strategies that do not strictly separate humans and other species but promote co-existence; 2) new modes of governing ecosystems and development in these spaces; and 3) alternative funding arrangements that do not rely on market expansion and can work under conditions of austerity. This project brings together conceptual innovations from sustainability research and practical experiences from several case studies from Africa, Europe, North and South America to develop, evaluate and strengthen the transformative potential of these three pathways towards sustainability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Common sense holds that mitigation planning done before a major disaster should help reduce disaster impacts and shape recovery, including whether decision-makers leverage the window of opportunity that opens after a disaster to avoid repeating decisions from the past such as concentrating development in floodplains that increase long-term risk. This project overcomes two barriers that have previously limited research on linkages between mitigation planning and recovery decision-making: 1) lack of comprehensive datasets on hazard mitigation planning and 2) datasets that do exist do not cover areas hit by major disasters. The research team's prior work in North Carolina and with Hurricanes Matthew and Florence provide unique opportunities to resolve both barriers by first collecting data on post-disaster recovery decision making, outputs like planning documents, and outcomes like decisions to steer development out of known hazardous locations. And second, coupling these recovery data with the researchers' data on hazard mitigation from earlier in the 2000s in quantitative analysis and case studies. In addition to new scientific knowledge, the research activities will generate timely and novel policy and practice-relevant information, extend the foundation of datasets needed for longitudinal and comparative analyses, and strengthen the hazards research community. This scientific research contribution thus supports NSF's mission to promote the progress of science and to advance our national welfare. In this case, the benefits will be insights to improve community planning and mitigation for disasters which can save lives and reduce economic losses.<br/><br/>Theoretically, pre-disaster hazard mitigation planning can improve post-disaster decision-making by 1) improving local decision-making processes by fostering a collaborative network of local stakeholders, 2) generating plans that organize information and prioritize approaches to reduce long-term risks, and 3) increasing implementation of locally prioritized mitigation approaches, including non-structural approaches like prohibiting rebuilding in floodplains and restoring wetlands. Hurricanes Matthew and Florence create a natural experiment aligning with a multi-dimensional dataset on hazard mitigation planning generating as part of a national evaluation of the Disaster Mitigation Act of 2000. The overarching hypothesis for this project is that communities with higher quality pre-disaster hazard mitigation planning and implementation will have reduced disaster impacts, and will better capitalize on the post-disaster window of opportunity to pursue non-structural mitigation approaches in recovery than communities with lower quality pre-disaster hazard mitigation efforts. This proposed research will collect data on decision making, planning outputs, and planning outcomes during hurricane recovery through content analysis of mitigation and recovery documents, surveys and interviews with key stakeholders, field visits to matched pairs of case counties, and from secondary sources. Multivariate regression modeling will identify the strength and directions of relationships between pre-event hazard mitigation and post-disaster recovery decision-making, outputs, and outcomes, controlling for the external and internal influences, such as hazard intensity and social vulnerability. Detailed case studies will complement and extend the knowledge generated from the regression modeling by examining the role of local champions in advancing support for non-structural mitigation among local stakeholders and decision-makers and conducting fine-grained analysis of whether variation in pre-event implementation of mitigation approaches (e.g. non-structural vs. structural) was associated with reduced damage and disruption.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To realize insights from these fractured datasets, data scientists often set up a data federation in which multiple autonomous databases are united to appear as a single engine for querying. In many settings this is challenging due to privacy concerns and regulatory requirements. This project investigates a private data federation that runs queries (in SQL) over the combined secret records of multiple sources such that the only information revealed from a query's execution is that which can be deduced from its output.  The federation uses secure multi-party computation to protect its inputs.  These cryptographic protocols run obliviously among the data providers such that their execution is independent of a query's secret inputs. The findings from the project, which include the open-source private data federation prototype, could empower database users to gain actionable insights from fractured datasets without specialized training.  <br/> <br/>This project identifies, formalizes, and exploits opportunities to run private data federation queries efficiently while upholding their privacy guarantees.  It uses synergies between the relational model and secure computation to create new algorithms for oblivious database operators that minimize their use of heavyweight cryptographic protocols.  The investigators design and evaluate an algebra that leverages properties of the relational model, such as key definitions and integrity constraints, to  bound the cardinality of a query's intermediate results thereby reducing the complexity of its secure circuits.

Such research is challenged by the relatively short time period of observation for which digital records are readily available. Historical data, recorded on paper and other physical media, potentially extend the time period of Earth observation to many decades. However, if such dark data are to be preserved and made available digitally to harness the data revolution, there are compelling challenges. The historical data are largely siloed; data are only available to scientists who can commit to traveling to specific archives or from archives capable of serving data requests. In addition, some of the physical media have been damaged or lost and/or at risk of losing stewardship. Hence, it is imperative that the community organize to preserve as well as make available these irreplaceable collections.

Differences in body form can be adaptive for certain environments, such as assisting in thermoregulation of the body through the dissipation or retention of heat, but can also be related to factors such as genetic drift and population history.  This doctoral dissertation research will examine human skeletal variation to understand the impact of various environmental factors on human body form across a wide geographical range.  The project will help to elucidate how environmental factors may have complex, differential effects in males versus females and across different parts of the skeleton. Skeletal data from the project will be compiled into a freely accessible online database. The addition of data for groups and regions of the world that are currently underrepresented in biological and forensic studies will increase understanding of human variation and global diversity.  The project will also foster international research collaborations and student training at the undergraduate and graduate levels. <br/><br/>Asia has diverse climates, high population densities, and a long history of human habitation.

Understanding how neurons and immune cells in the brain communicate with each other through the exchange of neurotransmitters and cytokines could reveal new signaling pathways that are crucial to treating various neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's and Parkinson's Disease. Neurons typically release various types of neurotransmitters to correspond with neighboring cells, while immune cells commonly release cytokines to modulate immune responses. Recent discoveries provide strong evidence suggesting bi-directional communication between neurotransmitters and cytokines for the purpose of modulating one another. Therefore, it is critical to monitor the dynamics of both of these species interactively and simultaneously in a closed-loop system, where one or more types of neurotransmitters can influence a series of cytokines, and vice versa. This project investigates novel biosensing strategies and the development of a fully integrated device platform that can simultaneously measure the neurochemicals and cytokines from neurons and immune cells, respectively, as they are released. Successful implementation of this technology will greatly impact the neuroscience community by elucidating the intricate signaling pathways and the mechanisms through which neuroinflammation and immune responses occur in the brain.<br/><br/>The research objective of this project is to implement an integrated biosensing platform that enables real-time measurement of the key neurochemicals and inflammatory cytokines from cells in situ as they are secreted. To achieve this goal, the following strategies will be applied: (1) Molecular templating will be used to implement a novel polymer-based target receptor that will enhance the selectivity in analyte recognition; (2) The electrochemical sensing technique will be integrated with a graphene field-effect transistor to enhance signal amplification and sensitivity in analyte detection; and (3) A lab-on-a-chip device that integrates the cell culture system and the biosensing components will be implemented. The educational objective of this project is to utilize the research activities as a platform to train the current and the next generation of STEM workforce. This will be achieved through the following strategic approaches: (1) Training the next generation of scientists and engineers through K-12 outreach activities; (2) Preparing engineers- and scientists-in-training through undergraduate and graduate education and mentoring; and (3) Supporting the current industrial workforce by implementing an online graduate certificate program. These educational activities will expose the students in various stages in their STEM career to the areas of (1) microfabrication of microfluidic devices, (2) the concepts of biosensing and bioelectronics, and (3) nanomaterial- and transistor-based detection of biomolecules.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To foster this community capacity, post-disaster reconstruction programs must both assist with the construction of safer shelters and enhance local understanding of safe shelter. Little research currently exists, however, on whether this assistance actually results in safer shelter and improved community capacity to build safer shelter. To foster community capacity for safe shelter design and construction, this project: (1) examines how households perceive the safety of their shelter, recognizing that these perceptions influence local design and construction practices; (2) assesses the engineering performance of the post-disaster shelters in future hazard events; (3) compares perceptions and engineering assessments to determine what and why discrepancies exist; and (4) creates a communication design for nongovernmental and governmental organizations assisting with disaster response that incorporates socio-cultural understanding to enhance local capacity for safe shelter. By addressing the complex interactions between humans, disasters, and the built environment in a multi-hazard approach, this project will reduce vulnerability to future disaster events, contributing to increased community resilience and improved quality of life. It also addresses both the humanitarian imperative to build safer shelters in vulnerable communities, and provide critical information for organizations and governments, including the U.S. government, in supporting local capacity for safe shelter. <br/><br/>This project will analyze 15 communities and reconstruction programs in Puerto Rico (responding to 2017's Hurricane Maria) and the Philippines (responding to 2013's Typhoon Haiyan and 2017's Ormoc earthquake) to: (1) assess local understanding of shelter safety in multiple hazards, including causal factors influencing this understanding, through a household survey; (2) assess the expected performance of various post-disaster shelter typologies to quantify safety during future earthquake and wind events using performance-based engineering methods, developing a rapid screening tool that can be used in design or evaluation; (3) identify conflicts between perceived and assessed safety of shelter, and why these conflicts exist, by comparing engineering assessments with local perceptions; and (4) create a communication design for organizations assisting with disaster response that incorporates socio-cultural understanding to address conflicts and create safer shelter.

It is the most costly invasive crop pest worldwide, for which there is no effective solution with acceptable resistance management.  DMB has developed resistance to more than 90 active ingredients in conventional insecticides, i.e., almost every insecticide class known.

The goal is to develop a product that is efficacious, selective, and provides improved resistance management against field populations of DMB.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is the development of RNAi-based pesticide for the treatment of diamondback moth (Plutella xylostella) infestations in cruciferous crops.  In the last five years, there have been significant advances in the methods for the production of RNAi triggers that allow the manufacturing of these materials in large quantities and at a low price, which is required for broad agricultural applications. Topical RNAi-based pesticides have been demonstrated in the lab to be very selective with respect to the intended target. They also may be readily modified to combat developed pesticide resistance by target pests. However, due to low efficacy at economically attractive application rates, very few pests and no Lepidopteran insects are currently in the RNAi list of commercial targets. This project specifically addresses the challenges related to RNAi efficacy, and the development of the proposed technology could be applied to Lepidopteran control and other biotechnology applications.

First, the investigators will establish a baseline of how extant catarrhine molars are altered by macroscopic wear and use phylogenetic comparative methods to test whether diet or tooth morphology has a greater influence on maintenance of shearing function. Second, these methods will be applied to measure the shearing and crushing/grinding potential from molars of Oligocene and Miocene catarrhines. While extant Old World monkeys have two fully developed lophs on their molars, early members of this clade exhibit partial loph development in some molars. The investigators will test whether these early stages of bilophodonty gave stem cercopithecoids greater persistence of certain tooth functions relative to their non-cercopithecoid catarrhine relatives.

A system composed of thousands or even millions of storage devices must provide these characteristics, though individual devices may lack them.  Finding and using data in such large, complex systems is challenging, yet it must be made simple and efficient for end users.  Complex systems are also subject both to hardware and software failures as well as directed attacks to steal or destroy data, so storage systems must guard against both security breaches and data loss.<br/><br/>CRSS is concerned with adapting systems to better utilize new storage technologies such as byte-addressable non-volatile memory (BNVM), shingled disk, and glass.  Operating systems and file systems must adapt to these new technologies to provide higher performance and better usability for BNVM, and improved security, efficiency, and long-term reliability for archival storage.  Cross-cutting issues such as improved security and the usage of machine learning to optimize storage systems are relevant for all types of storage systems, yet there remain many open questions in how to address these issues, particularly given the large scale in both time and size that CRSS is exploring.  Improving storage systems for large-scale data science is also a significant challenge that CRSS is addressing.<br/><br/>Data storage is the foundation of our digital society: the vast majority of our knowledge and information is stored digitally.  The research done at CRSS will allow society as a whole to better keep and utilize the flood of information our world is gathering.

These incoherent scatter radars (ISRs) are used to examine the properties of the electromagnetically charged layers of Earth's atmosphere. AMISR science is directly relevant to several societally important aspects of space weather, including geomagnetically induced currents, satellite drag, radio scintillation, radio absorption, the radiation belt particle environment, and space weather impacts on transpolar aviation. In addition to maintaining infrastructure that enables research and education, student involvement in AMISR research is supported by prioritizing student experiments, attending community workshops, recruiting undergraduates through the SRI Research Experience for Undergraduates program, recruiting undergraduates at UAF to assist with optical data analysis, and participating in the annual ISR summer school. <br/><br/>The project includes the continued operation and maintenance of these facilities at their current locations with no new construction or major repairs. The AMISR facilities offer unique observational capabilities that continue to enable a variety of scientific investigations related to multiple Solar and Space Physics Decadal Survey goals for Solar Wind-Magnetosphere and Atmosphere- Ionosphere-Magnetosphere interactions. RBO is the only incoherent scatter radar site in the world above 80 degree geomagnetic latitude. This location deep in the polar cap permits unique investigations of the polar geospace environment. The combination of the advanced radar capabilities of PFISR, the extensive suite of optical instruments in Alaska, the sounding rocket launch capabilities at the Poker Flat Research Range (PFRR), and the location of PFRR in the main auroral oval make PFRR one of the premiere sites in the world for research in upper atmospheric physics, auroral plasma physics, and magnetosphere- ionosphere coupling.

Using these sensors to measure blade surface temperatures will replace the significant cost of unplanned outages, by revealing when combustors are over firing to enable operators to take corrective measures. According to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, power generation gas turbines accounted for 1.3 million tons of NOx and SOx emissions. NOx emissions are increased due to erroneous combustor firing. This project would also lead to acceleration of adoption for developmental engines owing to reduced cost and labor requirements associated with measurement instrumentation installation. Also, this can be used in monitoring harsh environment parameters in remotely inaccessible locations, while providing insight to control systems increasing the efficiency of systems in nuclear reactors and chemical processing plants.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project will develop a polymer-derived ceramics (PDC) sensor system for gas turbine engine's blade surface temperature measurement. Currently, no sensors exist that can survive these harsh environments in-situ.

The underlying rationale for this recommendation is intuitive: a video-record provides information about deviations from best practices and may promote lineup administrator compliance with established guidelines. As much as these benefits resonate with psychological researchers, there is no research on any potential costs to video-recording. For example, it is unknown whether the act of video-recording negatively impacts witnesses' decision-making process. Furthermore, the intuitive benefits described above are likely a small subset of the potential advantages of video-recording identification procedures. The purpose of the proposed studies is, therefore, to test for possible additional benefits to video-recording that might accrue across the spectrum of an eyewitness's interaction with the justice system and to identify potential costs of the recommendation. The results from the proposed research will either provide additional support for this recommendation, thereby encouraging reluctant police departments to adopt the practice, or will highlight concerns regarding its implementation. As responsible advocates of science-based recommendations, psychological scientists must find answers to these questions in order to determine how to implement this recommendation.<br/> <br/>The research will be conducted in three phases. In the first phase, an experiment tests whether video-recordings of eyewitness lineup identifications reveal different non-verbal behaviors between accurate and inaccurate witnesses, information which could be used by the legal system to assess witness reliability. In addition, the experiment tests whether witnesses make different identification decisions as a function of being recorded, as predicted by theoretical models of eyewitness decision-making. The second phase tests whether showing witnesses a video of their own identification inoculates witnesses from harmful confidence inflation produced by post-identification feedback, a potentially beneficial effect predicted by theoretical models of eyewitness confidence assessment. One experiment in this phase tests whether this effect is moderated by camera perspective; a second experiment tests whether this effect is moderated by the difficulty of the lineup task. The final phase tests whether showing fact-finders a video of an eyewitness identification procedure assists them in discriminating accurate from inaccurate witnesses. One experiment in this phase tests whether this benefit depends on fact-finders' prior beliefs about the guilt of the identified person. A second experiment tests whether an empirically-validated checklist containing information about witnesses' non-verbal cues to accuracy improves the ability to discriminate accurate from inaccurate witnesses. As a whole, the proposed experiments test heretofore unexamined benefits and costs of video-recording eyewitnesses' identifications. From a practical perspective, data from these experiments can be used to develop recommendations regarding how to implement the video-recording recommendation as well as how to use those video-recordings to improve fact-finder decision-making. From a theoretical perspective, data obtained from these experiments might suggest essential refinements to models of witness decision-making and retrospective confidence reports.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project supports an ongoing Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site at Carnegie-Mellon University that provides students with training in interdisciplinary software engineering research,<br/>including understanding the research literature, formulating and refining research questions, developing novel solutions to software engineering problems, and applying scientific evaluation methods. The project will support the<br/>training of 30 undergraduate students over 3 years with research experiences in interdisciplinary software engineering at Carnegie Mellon University. These students will be recruited primarily from undergraduate-only institutions where students have limited research opportunities, with a special emphasis on providing opportunities to members of underrepresented groups in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) and first- and second-year students. Participants will perform research with faculty mentors, participate in community activities, and communicate their work both through traditional publication channels and student research competitions and<br/>via department-wide presentations at the end of the summer.  A primary goal for the program is to improve the pipeline from college to graduate school and from graduate school into faculty positions; simultaneously, the site actively trains graduate students to act as effective mentors of research assistants, a critical skill for future faculty members.<br/><br/>While built on computer science fundamentals (like algorithms, programming languages, compilers, and machine learning), software engineering is simultaneously an engineering discipline.  That is, both the practice of SE and SE research problems revolve around technical solutions that successfully resolve conflicting constraints. As such, trade-offs between costs and benefits are an integral part of evaluating the effectiveness of methods and tools.  This REU site takes this further, by tackling research problems that are at the intersection of software engineering and another field, including privacy, security, mobility, and human psychology and other sciences.  A subset of these problems includes, among others:<br/>* Sustainable maintenance of critical open source infrastructure;<br/>* Development of novel programming languages that can (A) support and enforce<br/>critical security properties or (B) support visualization of mathematical<br/>diagrams and notation; <br/>* Encoding and analysis of privacy requirements across distributed,<br/>service-oriented systems; and<br/>* Automatic identification and repair of defects in complex, modern software<br/>systems.<br/>The project will build on the experience of many of the faculty mentors who have<br/>worked with undergraduate students in their individual research.

Beginning in 2008, so-called ""predictive policing"", which entails using analytical methods to predict how, when, where, and by whom crimes will occur, has been deployed by police departments in many states.  These methods rely on  historical data collected on time, location, and details of crimes, as well as on characteristics of perpetrators and victims.  While some jurisdiction have shown an overall decrease in crime after implementation of predictive policing, other evaluative studies have shown the effects to be negligible or even detrimental.  These methods have been criticized on three critical aspects:  (1) they are not informed by a sociological perspective; (2) they assume that data include the necessary information for both prediction and effective response; and (3) they ignore the dynamic nature of the policing system.  This conference will bring together appropriate researchers, along with practitioners, to build a cross-disciplinary understanding of policing challenges that may be addressable by decision analytics and operations research.<br/><br/>One of the most serious challenges facing police departments is the effective use of resources to address calls for service, especially when responding to serious crimes.  Police departments recognize that part of a comprehensive approach to community safety involves protecting the rights of all involved during police encounters.  The focus of this workshop is on identifying operational aspects, including data collection and analysis, planning, training, and crime scene investigation, where additional research may lead to improved resource allocation.  Day 1 of the conference includes keynotes on predictive policing and data analytic case studies, as well as breakout sessions for working groups. Day 2 of the conference will include a keynote speaker addressing international policing strategies, and working groups will continue to discuss and document research needs.  Four teams of researchers who have established relationships with large police organizations serve as workshop organizers.  Additional teams of attendees (operations engineers, criminal justice researchers, police department leadership) will be recruited to participate in the workshop.

Through Noyce support, MSIs have the potential to offer incentives for STEM undergraduates to pursue K-12 teaching careers. <br/><br/>The QEM Network will use organizational learning to meet the following objectives in three phases: (1) Initiation Phase - Conduct one webinar per year (over two years) targeting approximately 500 potential PIs and administrators from 100 MSIs to discuss institutional and individual readiness for preparing a competitive Noyce proposal and the social and civic responsibility of MSIs to advance diversity in STEM teaching; (2) Engagement Phase - Provide one workshop per year (over two years) for MSI faculty members to connect Noyce proposal ideas to larger societal needs for diversity in STEM teaching; and (3) Maintenance Phase - Provide ongoing tailored post-workshop guidance focused on enhancing participants' ability to complete and submit competitive Noyce proposals and reinforce societal needs for diversity in STEM teaching. This project will assist with developing tools that help MSIs to compete for the resources necessary to provide measurable resources to their STEM education students, so that their students can become STEM teachers who make important contributions to our nation. The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts and experienced, exemplary K-12 STEM teachers to become STEM master teachers.

The field of delivery of genetic or other material to cells has not kept pace with advancements in genetic modification and high-throughput screening technologies.  The proposed platform will offer an alternative to the time-consuming and labor-intensive methods of transfection including lentiviral transduction and cuvette-based electroporation, which are difficult to automate.

The platform will allow scientists and clinicians to more rapidly and reliably engineer immune and other cells for discovery of new therapeutic targets and therapeutics.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project will be to develop a scalable, automated, non-viral cell engineering platform with the potential to operate up to 10,000 times faster than conventional electroporation using high-throughput liquid handling.  Using the core cell engineering technology developed in Phase I, the goal is to develop an automated protocol for gene transfection on a liquid handling robot compatible with 96 or 384 well plate technology.  The first objective is to demonstrate the manufacturability of cell engineering devices for high-throughput cell engineering. Preliminary work in this area has shown that these devices can be injection molded, thus reducing cost while increasing the potential for production at scale. In the Phase II project, injection molded prototypes of the cell engineering devices will be developed to prove manufacturability and determine the cost to manufacture at scale (millions of parts per year). Second, there are several supplemental systems that must be integrated with a liquid handling apparatus to enable the proposed high-throughput cell engineering. Supplemental systems include a power source and power distribution manifold that interacts with each sample of the 96 or 384 well array.

It will look at how being a member of a specific Community of Practice (CoP) influences teacher identity, belief in their personal teaching abilities, and desire to remain in the profession related to teacher retention. The institutions (SUNY at Stony Brook University, University of Kentucky, Kennesaw State University, University of Minnesota, University of Wisconsin-Oshkosh, and the University of Missouri-St. Louis) in this study span the U.S. and represent successful Noyce teacher preparation programs with a variety of recruitment strategies (e.g., career changers), induction support structures (e.g., online), and teacher placements (e.g., rural vs. urban). These six sites will also allow for a comparison of Noyce and non-Noyce teachers emerging from the different teacher preparation programs.  The goal is to determine whether a core set of program features contributes to the success of each induction program, or if distinct program features are useful for unique populations (e.g., periodic face-to-face meetings for career changers, or online support for urban teachers). The project also seeks to determine which program features lead to different community structures (e.g., collaborating mainly with teachers inside or outside the school), and how that community affects a teacher's perception of the profession (e.g., teacher is connected to professionals across the state and wants to remain in the profession as a career). The primary research methodology used in this research study is Social Network Analysis, which will be used to determine with whom teachers exchange information related to their teaching. The study will benefit the field by highlighting induction strategies appropriate and effective for diverse teacher groups, and lead to a desire for increased retention in the workforce. The study will inform workforce issues in the organizational sciences, in which limited work has explicitly adopted a social network approach to explain human resource outcomes.<br/><br/>The theory being examined in this project is the extent to which teacher identify formation linked to persistence in the profession can be detected in participants' social networks and correlated to Noyce preparation and induction features.  The three-stage research design will include documenting the antecedents of network formation, teacher networks, and the outcomes of networks. In Stage I, information will be collected about the support structures present at each site, and which activities and demographics represent the participants' experiences during induction. Coherence between the planned focus of each program, and the experiences of the participants, will be examined. In Stage II, social network information will be collected from participants using an ego-centric network survey (with data focused on a given teacher's local community of ties, e.g. the CoP) of who each teacher exchanges information with related to teaching content and pedagogy, how frequently the interactions occur, and whether the contacts occur in the local school or across regional, state, or national levels. Survey data will be transformed into matrices needed to generate STEM teacher networks, and examined for size, density, strength of ties, and geographic proximity to the teacher, utilizing the latest social network analysis software packages. Network properties from Stage II will be modeled using Stage I data to determine which activities and support structures contribute to different structural CoPs. In Stage III, teacher perceptions of their teaching self-efficacy, identity within the profession, and outlook on remaining in the profession will be collected. Stage III data will be modeled using Stage II network data to determine which CoPs influence desirable teacher outcomes. In order to strengthen claims of causality from the quantitative analyses, teachers will be asked which activities influence their CoP network, and which portions of the network effect their outcomes. Stage I and III instruments will be aligned to NSF Annual Participant Surveys, and Department of Education Teacher Follow-up Surveys, respectively, so results from this study may be generalized to national data in future studies."

This research integrates archaeological evidence of human behavior and microcomputed tomography data to investigate bone structure as an intersection between behavior and biology. Low bone mass related health complications are a prominent expense within the U.S. healthcare system; this project will provide insights into the factors that may contribute to the risk of low bone mass related health issues from an anthropological perspective. The project will also contribute to the development educator workshops for using publicly available 3D image data for classroom-based research projects. <br/><br/>Recent work has found that human groups with higher levels of activity tend to have more robust cortical and trabecular bone structure compared to groups with relatively lower activity levels. However, much of this research has relied on comparing geographically and genetically distinct human groups. This project investigates the relationship between cortical and trabecular bone structural variation across several post-cranial elements within and between human groups that are genetically and geographically similar, but behaviorally distinct in order to test whether the relationship between behavior and bone structure is maintained, or if other factors such as diet, genetic background, and environment play a larger role in forming adult skeletal phenotype than previously considered. Microcomputed tomography scan data of the humerus, cervical vertebra, femur, tibia, talus, and calcaneus will be collected. Cortical and trabecular bone structural variation will be quantified and compared between groups with different subsistence strategies including foragers, horticulturalists, and intensive agriculturalists. Additionally, the amount of variation in cortical and trabecular bone will be investigated within and between both individuals and skeletal elements in order to understand how different levels of bone structural organization respond to variation in subsistence strategy and mechanical loading.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diabetic retinopathy is among the leading causes of vision loss in the world. This devastating complication of both type I and II diabetes results in structural damage to the sensitive vasculature of the retina. Once structural damage is inflicted, it is difficult, if not impossible, to ameliorate it. Small changes in the retinal vasculature's oxygen saturation have been shown to be a reliable indicator of diabetic retinopathy before structural damage occurs. Since there is no clinical non-invasive technology capable of detecting these small functional changes, a major need exists for new retinal oximetry technologies. Diabetic retinopathy affects 200 million people worldwide. The American Diabetes Association reports that the cost of diabetes in the US in 2012 was $245 billion, including $69 billion in reduced productivity and $176 billion in medical costs. Since 40% of diabetics are anticipated to develop diabetic retinopathy, the estimated economic cost of diabetic retinopathy is $98 billion annually. By mitigating the occurrence of diabetic retinopathy, this technology will help reduce the cost of diabetic retinopathy treatment, its overall economic burden, and help save the vision of millions of people around the world.<br/><br/>The primary technical innovation behind the proposed technology is its use of a novel physics-based model to overcome the challenges of high-resolution retinal imaging. These challenges include the multi-layered structure of the retina, absorbance dynamics, and the need to produce an image in one snapshot to reduce motion artifacts. Compared with existing methods based on structural imaging, the successful outcome of this project will become a commercial technology-of-choice for ophthalmologists around the world, enabling cost-effective detection of early stage diabetic retinopathy or pre-retinopathy. The development of the technology proceeds through iterative optimization between laboratory and real-use environments to generate robust, validated data. Specifically, in Phase II, the research objectives of the project are pursued in two parallel tracks: 1) refinement of the core imaging system, and 2) validation using model and human subjects in a clinical environment. The outcome of this project will be an easy-to-use, reliable diagnostic imaging and monitoring technology with proven clinical utility in detecting the onset of diabetic retinopathy based on functional properties, before structural damage has occurred in the patient.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Through challenging them with real-world problems, this project will provide training, mentorship and support to undergraduate students so that they can become independent researchers. The overall project management strategy will follow the spirit of swarm intelligence: encouraging the frequent interactions among a diverse group of undergraduate students to achieve something that might not otherwise be achievable by the individuals alone - for example, advancing the state-of-the-art in human-swarm interaction research). Throughout the project, the faculty and graduate student mentors will encourage creative thinking and frequent interactions to enhance the students' problem solving skills. This will allow them to transition from passive learners to independent thinkers of the future. This effort in turn will contribute to the growth of a high-quality and diverse US scientific workforce in the important area of robotics.<br/><br/>The intellectual focus of this project is to allow one human operator to effectively manage a large robot swarm to achieve desired global objectives. Tailored around a swarm system inspired by the cooperative thermal soaring and foraging behaviors of hawks, three sub-projects will be conducted by undergraduate students during this REU project. First, a swarm testing environment with 50 custom designed robots will be developed. Second, distributed, non-hierarchical agent-level interaction rules that will allow the emergence of desirable robot swarm behaviors will be investigated. Third, novel human-swarm interaction modes for managing a large self-organized robot swarm without using a direct command and control structure between the operator and robots will be invented and experimentally demonstrated. Through these efforts, the undergraduate students will have the opportunity to work as a team in performing both fundamental research and hands-on experiments. The successful completion of the project will enable many potential robot applications such as search and rescue, environmental monitoring, and robotic mining and construction. The outcomes from this project will be broadly disseminated through demonstration videos, peer-reviewed publications, and open sharing of the developed software.

In the Americas, ancient genomes have revealed new and surprising details, such as the presence of previously unknown populations, previously unsuspected relationships between groups, and new estimates of dates for past events in human history.  Although recent studies have investigated the origins and history of different Native American groups, few have focused on the indigenous peoples of the Aleutian Islands, a population that may prove central to our understanding of human dispersals in the western hemisphere. The analysis of genomes from ancient and contemporary Aleuts will allow us to better understand the origins of these peoples, how they adapted to a challenging environment, and how European contact and recent population events have affected their genetic diversity. This research is supported by Aleut political and cultural leaders, who are interested in using genetic approaches to better understand their people's history. Results from this project will be used in education materials for the participating communities, as well as in initiatives designed to train Native American students in genetics. <br/><br/>The Americas were the last continents to become inhabited by humans, but it has recently become clear that the history of this process was far more complicated than originally understood based on archaeology alone. For example, current archaeological evidence suggests that the Aleutian Islands were peopled approximately 9,000 years ago in a series of population movements from the Alaska Peninsula westward, with groups inhabiting the western islands by about 3,000 years ago. A recently published analysis of genomic-scale data from ancient and contemporary peoples of the Arctic, which includes data from a few ancient individuals from the Eastern Aleutian islands, indicates that the Aleutian gene pool dates to approximately 5,000 years ago, leaving a 4,000 year discrepancy between archaeological and genetic records. One hypothesis to resolve the discrepancy between the genetic and archaeological dates holds that the earliest ancestors of Native Americans - who lived in Beringia approximately 20,000 years ago - may have moved southward to the Alaska Peninsula, eventually peopling the present-day central and western islands. The investigators will test this hypothesis and uncover additional details of the history of the peopling of the Aleutian Islands through the analysis of complete genomes from ancient and contemporary Aleuts. They will also assess the demographic effects of European contact beginning in the 18th century on Aleut populations, and characterize the genetic adaptations of ancient and contemporary Aleuts to the challenging environmental conditions present in the archipelago over time. This research was developed in a partnership between Aleut political and cultural leadership and the researchers at the University of Kansas, which is the result of a decades-long collaboration.

This technology will enable the ability to provide personalized treatment for patients, and more successful and cost-effective clinical trials, bring drugs to market more rapidly.  The goal is identification of disease subtypes and patient subgroups, a prerequisite to the ability to distinguish between patients who are in danger and need the most aggressive treatments, and those who are less suited to treatment because they will never progress or recur or they will develop resistance. Currently, 70% of drugs entering Phase III clinical trials fail, leading to a loss of more than $1 trillion per year. This may be avoided by refining trial inclusion criteria and administering the drug only to the patients most likely to respond. The technology is designed to identify patient subgroups most likely to respond or not respond to a given treatment. This technology also may reduce the cost of prophylactic clinical trials by reducing the number of subjects and/or duration necessary to achieve sufficient power. The technology will significantly reduce drug development costs while simultaneously improving patient care by selecting the correct treatment for each patient. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this SBIR Phase II project is to develop a novel analysis method and software package that is able to identify subtypes of disease based on the integration of multiple types of omics data. Many drug candidates fail and many patients receive inappropriate treatment because of the current inability to distinguish between subgroups of patients (respondents vs. non-respondents) and/or subtypes of disease (aggressive vs. non-aggressive). The current unmet challenge is to discover the molecular subtypes of disease and subgroups of patients. Attempts to achieve this based solely on gene expression signatures have been undertaken but yielded only modest success (very few gene expression tests are FDA-approved to date). The technology proposed here may be used to discover clinically relevant disease subtypes by integrating multiple types of high-throughput data. In addition, the Phase I results obtained on real patient data demonstrated that the technology is able to distinguish between more and less aggressive types of cancer based on their molecular profiles alone. This Phase II project proposes to extend this technology to integrate genomic and clinical data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The underlying rationale for this recommendation is intuitive: a video-record provides information about deviations from best practices and may promote lineup administrator compliance with established guidelines. As much as these benefits resonate with psychological researchers, there is no research on any potential costs to video-recording. For example, it is unknown whether the act of video-recording negatively impacts witnesses' decision-making process. Furthermore, the intuitive benefits described above are likely a small subset of the potential advantages of video-recording identification procedures. The purpose of the proposed studies is, therefore, to test for possible additional benefits to video-recording that might accrue across the spectrum of an eyewitness's interaction with the justice system and to identify potential costs of the recommendation. The results from the proposed research will either provide additional support for this recommendation, thereby encouraging reluctant police departments to adopt the practice, or will highlight concerns regarding its implementation. As responsible advocates of science-based recommendations, psychological scientists must find answers to these questions in order to determine how to implement this recommendation.<br/> <br/>The research will be conducted in three phases. In the first phase, an experiment tests whether video-recordings of eyewitness lineup identifications reveal different non-verbal behaviors between accurate and inaccurate witnesses, information which could be used by the legal system to assess witness reliability. In addition, the experiment tests whether witnesses make different identification decisions as a function of being recorded, as predicted by theoretical models of eyewitness decision-making. The second phase tests whether showing witnesses a video of their own identification inoculates witnesses from harmful confidence inflation produced by post-identification feedback, a potentially beneficial effect predicted by theoretical models of eyewitness confidence assessment. One experiment in this phase tests whether this effect is moderated by camera perspective; a second experiment tests whether this effect is moderated by the difficulty of the lineup task. The final phase tests whether showing fact-finders a video of an eyewitness identification procedure assists them in discriminating accurate from inaccurate witnesses. One experiment in this phase tests whether this benefit depends on fact-finders' prior beliefs about the guilt of the identified person. A second experiment tests whether an empirically-validated checklist containing information about witnesses' non-verbal cues to accuracy improves the ability to discriminate accurate from inaccurate witnesses. As a whole, the proposed experiments test heretofore unexamined benefits and costs of video-recording eyewitnesses' identifications. From a practical perspective, data from these experiments can be used to develop recommendations regarding how to implement the video-recording recommendation as well as how to use those video-recordings to improve fact-finder decision-making. From a theoretical perspective, data obtained from these experiments might suggest essential refinements to models of witness decision-making and retrospective confidence reports.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much variation in body form and habit can be explained by adaptation to the habitats where these fishes live. But the effects of ecological habitat on processes leading to diversification over evolutionary time remain poorly explored. This project will focus on two groups of closely related species that harbor a huge diversity of benthic and pelagic forms (about 2000 species) to disentangle the effects of habitat transitions on rates of speciation and extinction. Understanding the factors that promote diversification in form and habit is important for the long-term conservation of marine biodiversity. Innovative image data analysis necessary to synthesize morphological variation among these fishes also will be applied to develop a fish species identification app for smartphones (FishSnap) that will be freely available to the public, expandable in the future to include all fishes. Educational opportunities will be available for undergraduate and graduate students and outreach activities in partnership with the National Museum of Natural History in Washington DC will result in a new public exhibit on fish biodiversity.<br/><br/>Recent studies in fish phylogenetics are resolving long-lasting uncertainties about the relationships among the most species-rich marine fish groups, and opening up unprecedented opportunities to infer mechanisms that explain their extraordinary diversity. This project takes advantage of newly discovered affinities among fishes that revealed two independent clades with benthic and pelagic forms to investigate connections between genomic and morphological features in relation to their ecological habitat. The researchers will collect and compare a genome-scale DNA sequence data set of protein-coding genes to infer a phylogenetic tree for about 800 species of these two groups. This tree will be time-calibrated on the basis of carefully selected fossil data to provide a dated evolutionary framework for comparative studies. The project will also assemble a large phenotypic (digital image) dataset of curated specimens for morphometric analysis. Using state-of-the art comparative methodologies, this project will shed light on the effect of habitat shifts along the benthic-pelagic axis on the rate of morphological and lineage diversification. The integration of well-resolved molecular phylogenies, the fossil record, trait and ecological data, and comparative methodologies will provide new insights to understand the causes of marine biodiversity."

The cold plasma water purification and enrichment technology, utilized in our proposed hydroponic system, can extend to other areas of agriculture as the antimicrobial chemicals produced in plasma rapidly kill pathogens and are safe for both plants and animals. The potential benefits stemming from this technology can help vertical farmers to eradicate food scarcity challenges in urban centers all over the world, powered by the sun's energy. Given the imminent, significant, and accelerating problems of agricultural sustainability and water conservation facing humanity, this technology has the potential to play a significant role in helping to preserve and sustain life on Earth as we know it. Additionally, the decrease in water volume needed for irrigation and the increased yield of plants treated with plasma-treated water also supports applications of plasma treatment in various farming and reforestation efforts. Finally, an ambitious goal for the company is to implement this technology in environments where resources other than electricity are extremely limited, such as long-term space missions.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will allow the company to better understand the needs of the company's potential customers and how plasma technology can offer solutions to the commercial agricultural market while providing technological insight to members of the hydroponic agriculture industry and opportunities for significant improvements to their existing agricultural systems and practices. Through these plasma technology commercialization efforts, the team envisions facilitating bigger, healthier, and more sustainable crop harvests for the modern farmer, while also reducing the volume of potentially harmful chemical additives, environmental damage, and wastefulness associated with current production methods. Current lab-scale research results are very promising, however, detailed analysis of the market and interviews with professional hydroponic farmers, industry experts, vendors, and customers are required to validate full-scale commercialization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Outsourcing is a common practice because of lower operational and labor costs. The detailed designs of outsourced components, however, are mostly proprietary to component designers and are black boxes to system designers. This poses a great challenge for system designers to estimate the system reliability during the system design stage. This project performs feasibility studies to explore possible ways for system designers to predict the system reliability without revealing proprietary details of outsourced components. As a result, this project offers to help engineers make more reliable, safer, and cheaper products, thereby increasing competitiveness and improving quality of life. This research could impact broad areas of design methodologies and wide engineering applications, ranging from large structural systems to small integrated circuit systems. Beyond engineering design, this project also benefits system engineering, reliability engineering, and operations research where system reliability plays a vital role.<br/> <br/>This research addresses reliability prediction at both component and system levels. From the perspective of component design, this project determines what reliability information a supplier should provide to system designers and how to do so. The information will be sufficient for system reliability analysis, and the proprietary information of the supplier will also be protected. From the perspective of system design, this project provides theories to system designers so that they could use the above component information to reconstruct component reliability models that accommodate dependencies between component failures, thereby producing an accurate system reliability prediction for decision making on system configurations, optimization, life cycle cost, maintenance, warranty, and so on."

The bio-nanocomposite is to be composed of montmorillonite clay and a bio-modifier made from swine manure. Use of such bio-based modifier can help reduce worldwide reliance on shrinking petroleum reserves while reducing CO2 emissions associated with the manufacture of petroleum-based products and the uncontrolled bio-waste decay in landfills and open lagoons.<br/><br/>The hypothesis to be tested is that that montmorillonite clay can be exfoliated using an amide-enriched bio-modifier made from swine manure to produce organo-clay containing individual silica nano-platelets. While the exfoliated clay can be used in multiple applications, this project aims to evaluate sustainability and technical feasibility of producing bio-based nano composite for use as construction materials. Accordingly, a secondary hypothesis is that introduction of the aforementioned bio-based nanocomposite into construction materials for outdoor applications such as roofing, sealing, building facades, roads and drive ways will have enhanced resistance to oxidative aging due to clay nano-particles playing as air barrier as well as carrier for certain bio-molecules with anti-aging properties. Accordingly, the project will examine environmental aspects of such outdoor applications along with technical feasibility. To do so, special attention will be given to study quality and quantity of the emissions during processing of bio-based nano composites as well as leachates during their application. Therefore, resulting material will be evaluated in terms of both associated thermo-mechanical properties and environmental aspects."

No consideration or improper consideration of uncertainty (unknowns, surprises) during system design may result in low reliability, quality, and robustness; higher costs; and even catastrophe. This research accounts for the most common type of uncertainty that varies in space and with respect to time with the following two benefits. First, it allows engineers to better understand how the space- and time-dependent uncertainty impacts system performance. Second, it enables engineers to design systems with minimized effect of the space- and time-dependent uncertainty. As a result, the research results will add new knowledge to the current theories and methodologies of engineering and systems design, and also make products more reliable and safer. This research will be applicable to wide engineering applications, ranging from large civil systems to small integrated circuit systems. Other potential areas that will benefit include operations research, reliability engineering, statistics, and probability, where space-dependent and time-dependent probabilistic approaches play a vital role. The inclusion of research results into engineering courses and educational materials will better foster probabilistic thinking for engineering students, making them be more responsible for public safety and welfare.<br/><br/>The objective of this research is to quantify and reduce the effect of space- and time-dependent uncertainty on system performance. The major approach is the integration of system analysis and design methodologies with advanced theories of stochastic processes and random fields. The project first answers a question about how the space- and time-dependent uncertainty in the system input (design parameters) propagates to the system output (performance). This provides a better understanding of the effect of uncertainty and identifies complete probabilistic characteristics of system performance over space and time. Second, this research answers a question of how to optimally determine design variables so that the effect of the space- and time-dependent uncertainty is minimized with a lower cost and reduced risk. All engineering systems are required to work properly with stable performance in a desired space and period of time, and this project will produce new methodologies to achieve this requirement."

The objective of this proposal is to request partial support for the registration and accommodation expenses of US-based undergraduate and graduate students traveling to the conference. Beginning in 2010, PECI is the oldest annual, student-run IEEE international conference about power and energy technology. PECI is an Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) approved conference and technically co-sponsored by  Power and Energy Society (PES), Power Electronics Society (PELS), and Industrial Applications Society (IAS) professional societies of IEEE. The conference is organized by the IEEE PES/PELS/IAS Joint Graduate Student Chapter at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and is advised by faculty in the Power and Energy area of the Electrical and Computer Engineering Department at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. PECI has become a perfect place in the Midwest for industry and academic researchers to discuss future power and energy topics such as renewable energy, machines for electric transportation, smart grid reliability, security of cyber-physical systems, and power electronics for emerging technologies. Thus, the intellectual merit of PECI are the student focused nature of the conference, from the student led steering committee to all technical and presentations, and the high quality publications and posters from student attendees. <br/><br/>PECI was founded for three key reasons: 1) to provide students in the Midwest an opportunity to participate in a research conference, 2) to provide a forum for students in the Midwest to present their research progress and outcomes for feedback to a technical audience of peers, industry professional, and 3) to inspire both undergraduate and graduate students to pursue careers in power and energy STEM fields. While PECI impact has expanded over the last eight years to include participants from around the world, we have retained our Midwest roots and mission statement by encouraging participation from Midwest universities, especially undergraduate students for the poster session. By attending PECI students benefit from closer interactions with experts, professors, and industry professionals and potentially receive advice or mentorship for their future career. In addition to student technical presentations and posters, students also learn about the mega-trends in power and energy and cutting edge research from three industry leaders and experts, who deliver keynote presentations and tours of a local microgrid research facility and new ECE building. Moreover, the importance of pursuing a career in power and energy is highlighted by a special careers session involving industry presentations about research demands for power and energy companies and a panel discussion regarding what a career in industry, a national laboratory, academia, or government would entail. With support from NSF, PECI seeks to reach a wider audience with this impact by encouraging participation from a larger number of Midwest and US schools, especially schools that do not offer a Ph.D. degree.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this project develops innovative and statistically sound methodologies for mining novel interactions within attributes or between attributes and phenotypes to help identify critical factors in biological applications.  In particular, the novel analysis methods can enable the genetic and environmental interactions underlying a range of complex diseases to be delineated. The research activities of this project can also promote the integration of biology, computer science, and statistics, which is highly significant to many applications. <br/><br/>The project will formulate various metrics that enable efficient pruning and searching in the multi-dimensional combinatorial space for identifying significant interaction relationships. This enables highly effective approaches that build search-based trees or identify highly correlated subspaces to detect meaningful local interactions that may not be significant considering the whole data sets but are strongly interacted with traits on a subset of data. This enables comparison of data from multiple different groups such as based on age, race, or other properties. It is important to find both common and different interactions in different groups so that effective methods can be developed for targeted groups. The methods developed will detect complex interactions between attributes in multiple groups simultaneously by capturing both their commonalities and differences in joint matrix factorization or deep learning models. These approaches are remarkably powerful for biological applications, such as detecting gene-gene interactions and gene-environmental interactions that lead to breast cancer. The concept of interaction is also ubiquitous and important in many scientific disciplines ranging from economics, sociology and physics, to the pharmaceutical sciences. The novel approaches and analysis tools developed in this project are useful for finding out any interaction relationships between attributes associated with phenotype labels or without phenotype labels.

These include reactions that couple two different molecular partners (""cross-coupling"") with improved selectivity, as well as  reactions related to the activation of inert organic substrates with oxygen. Cross-coupling reactions sped up by metal-containing compounds have become indispensable in the synthesis of a large number of important chemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials. While palladium-based catalysts are the most commonly used, Dr. Mirica is synthesizing and studying nickel (Ni)-based catalysts as they may be able to react with a wider variety of target molecules and with more specificity.  In addition, Professor Mirica has established a collaboration with Professor Tim Hubin from Southwestern Oklahoma State University (SWOSU), a regional university in Oklahoma that has an appreciable amount of students that belong to underrepresented groups. Professor Hubin and his students collaborate on the synthesis of some of the targeted catalysts, visiting the Mirica lab, and performing reactivity studies using their chemical systems.  This experience exposes the undergraduate students to an R1 research institution, and inspires them to pursue advanced degrees in chemistry.  Professor Mirica and his group continue to work closely with collaborators from Spain and South Korea. This collaborative experience is an excellent training ground to prepare them to work in a true international environment, very similar to a multinational corporation.<br/><br/>While palladium (Pd)-based catalysts are arguably the most commonly used in cross-coupling reactions, Ni-based cross-coupling catalysts have been developed recently.

By comparison to the Pd-mediated transformations that generally employ diamagnetic intermediates, the Ni systems can more easily undergo one-electron redox reactions and lead to additional reaction pathways.  The presence of paramagnetic Ni(I) and Ni(III) species makes reactivity characterization more difficult.

Thwaites and neighboring glaciers in the Amundsen Sea Embayment are rapidly losing mass in response to recent climate warming and related changes in ocean circulation. Mass loss from the Amundsen Sea Embayment could lead to the eventual collapse of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet, raising the global sea level by up to 2.5 meters (8 feet) in as short as 500 years. The processes driving the loss appear to be warmer ocean circulation and changes in the width and flow speed of the glacier, but a better understanding of these changes is needed to refine predictions of how the glacier will evolve. One highly sensitive process is the transitional flow of glacier ice from land onto the ocean to become a floating ice shelf. This flow of ice from grounded to floating is affected by changes in air temperature and snowfall at the surface; the speed and thickness of ice feeding it from upstream; and the ocean temperature, salinity, bathymetry, and currents that the ice flows into. The project team will gather new measurements of each of these local environmental conditions so that it can better predict how future changes in air, ocean, or the ice will affect the loss of ice to the ocean in this region.  <br/>  <br/>Current and anticipated near-future mass loss from Thwaites Glacier and nearby Amundsen Sea Embayment region is mainly attributed to reduction in ice-shelf buttressing due to sub-ice-shelf melting by intrusion of relatively warm Circumpolar Deep Water into sub-ice-shelf cavities. Such predictions for mass loss, however, still lack understanding of the dominant processes at and near grounding zones, especially their spatial and temporal variability, as well as atmospheric and oceanic drivers of these processes. This project aims to constrain and compare these processes for the Thwaites and the Dotson Ice Shelves, which are connected through upstream ice dynamics, but influenced by different submarine troughs. The team's specific objectives are to: 1) install atmosphere-ice-ocean multi-sensor remote autonomous stations on the ice shelves for two years to provide sub-daily continuous observations of concurrent oceanic, glaciologic, and atmospheric conditions; 2) measure ocean properties on the continental shelf adjacent to ice-shelf fronts (using seal tagging, glider-based and ship-based surveys, and existing moored and conductivity-temperature-depth-cast data), 3) measure ocean properties into sub-ice-shelf cavities (using autonomous underwater vehicles) to detail ocean transports and heat fluxes; and 4) constrain current ice-shelf and sub-ice-shelf cavity geometry, ice flow, and firn properties for the ice-shelves (using radar, active-source seismic, and gravimetric methods) to better understand the impact of ocean and atmosphere on the ice-sheet change.  The team will also engage the public and bring awareness to this rapidly changing component of the cryosphere through a ""Live from the Ice"" social media campaign in which the public can follow the action and data collection from the perspective of tagged seals and autonomous stations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Traditionally, the protection of these infrastructures has focused on preventing failures caused by accidents; however, there is a growing concern about preventing failures initiated by physical as well as cyber attacks. For example, the recent Executive Order 13636 on critical infrastructure cyber-security is a timely reminder on the growing need to improve the security posture and resiliency of our critical infrastructures against attacks, and in particular, a call of action for identifying well-documented and tested security best practices.  The goal of this Critical Resilient Interdependent Infrastructure Systems and Processes (CRISP) collaborative research project is to identify the successful practices and lessons learned by countries subject to persistent attacks on their critical infrastructures, and incorporate these lessons into social and technical solutions that the U.S. can use to better understand the nature of the threat, and to motivate better public and private sector postures for the protection of U.S. critical infrastructures from physical as well as cyber-attacks.  The research will leverage the experience of five decades of sustained attacks against the critical infrastructures of Colombia and study the government and industry responses and best practices in that country. It will also develop new algorithms and security solutions informed by the data collected on these attacks. These lessons will be translated into a new course focusing on terrorism, critical infrastructures, and cyber-security, with the goal of developing a multidisciplinary Masters on cyberconflict and terrorism targeted to students working in public policy as well as business leaders and stakeholders in our critical infrastructures. The results will be disseminated in academic as well as industrial conferences and in public and private partnerships for the protection of critical infrastructures such as those led by NIST and DHS.<br/><br/>Several analytical and theoretical models for interdiction or interdependencies of critical infrastructures remain abstract and speculative not only because there is scarce data on attacks to critical infrastructures, but also because it is easier to consider simple models or assumptions in order to keep the problem analytically or computationally tractable.  Evidence and empirical data of how attacks on critical infrastructures are planned and executed are essential for studying their impact on critical infrastructures, and for identifying the technical and social aspects for protecting these systems. Incorporating new adversary models and defense mechanisms based on real attacks and extracting statistics from these datasets into mathematical models of interdiction, or control interdependencies will require new theoretical developments in algorithms and optimization methods. For example the reconfiguration of power systems done by the operators of the power grid in Colombia can be considered as a moving target defense, and incorporating this dynamic aspect into interdiction games requires new formulations that have not been studied before. In addition, interdiction formulations considering interdependent infrastructures such as gas, water, telecommunications, and electricity will require different models of the ""initiating events"" and different models of the restoration processes. Similarly the inclusion of interdependent infrastructure models for control problems can add some advantages in the synchronization criteria and might improve synchronizability and stability. The mathematical conditions for phase cohesiveness and frequency synchronization when one infrastructure is subject to attacks will be studied in this research. Finally, extracting policy and strategic trends, and factors that have influenced the outcomes observed in datasets will require extensive analysis of a complex socio-technical component where multiple stakeholders (government, asset owners, services industry, and vendors) have different factors  influencing their actions and decisions."

Over a million US citizens are limb amputees, primarily lower leg amputees. This CAREER program will 1) work to improve the mobility of lower extremity amputees through research in design and control of powered ankle-foot prostheses, which mimic the steering mechanism of human gait by having two controllable degrees of freedom (DOF) and 2) integrate research with education and outreach to inspire and equip a diverse next generation of engineers. To work toward these long-term goals, this CAREER program will develop ? and use in education and outreach - a lightweight, cable-driven, powered ankle-foot prosthesis capable of steering and traversing slopes by learning from human ankle impedance in the sagittal and frontal planes during gait.<br/>Intellectual Merit: This project is based on the hypothesis that an ankle-foot prosthesis capable of applying torques and impedance modulation in both the sagittal and frontal planes, similar to the human ankle, will improve maneuverability and increase mobility by lowering the metabolic cost of gait - both when walking straight and turning. Advances in powered prostheses have shown the ability to reduce metabolic cost and increase the preferred speed of gait for unilateral transtibial amputees during straight walking by providing sufficient power during push-off. Powered prostheses can also reduce asymmetrical gait patterns and thus may lower risk of secondary complications. However, studies show that turning steps account for 8-50% of steps, depending on activity, and thus may account for 25% of daily steps. Modulation of ankle impedance in the sagittal and frontal planes plays a major role in controlling lateral and propulsive ground reaction forces. While a non-amputee relies on hip movement in the coronal plane and the moment generated in the ankle joint, an amputee using a passive prosthesis uses the hip extension in the sagittal plane as a gait strategy [5-8]. The hypothesis is supported by the PI?s preliminary results which show a large inversion of the ankle during the stance period of step turns, indicating a significant deviation of ankle rotations from the straight-step pattern. Understanding the role of the ankle in locomotion and developing a platform for design and control of a new ankle-foot prostheses will allow exploratory research and education. Research will include: Thrust 1: Estimate ankle impedance in the sagittal and frontal planes during the stance period of gait; Thrust 2: Develop a powered ankle-foot prosthesis with two controllable DOF; Thrust 3: Evaluate the design and control of the prosthesis using an evaluation platform and with below-knee amputees through collaboration with Mayo Clinic; and Thrust 4: Education/Outreach: Utilize the steerable ankle-foot prosthesis for education, outreach, and research experiences to impact diverse K-12, community college, undergraduate, and graduate students. The work is significant in that it will contribute 1) new knowledge about multivariable impedance modulation of the human ankle during the stance period of gait, an area not yet fully explored, and 2) a unique framework for developing and evaluating powered ankle-foot prostheses. The steerable ankle-foot prosthesis is innovative because it will enable amputees to walk with a more natural gait by using the ankle joint, rather than merely the hip and knee. Development of this novel platform will be a substantial step toward the PI?s long-term goal of improving design and maneuverability in lower extremity assistive prostheses and robots.<br/>Broader Impacts: Robotics is a high-impact way to attract the attention of future engineers. This project will develop outreach activities that spark and sustain STEM interest in pre-college students, especially underrepresented minorities. Development of an inexpensive powered ankle-foot prosthesis will improve well-being of Wounded Warriors and civilian amputees, while at the same time inspiring and training the future STEM workforce. In addition, the PI has designed and developed a low-cost EMG-controlled manipulator as educational platform that will be used in outreach programs to teach fundamentals of mechatronics, robotics, and biomechanics to K-12, community college, undergraduate, and graduate students. The developed outreach programs will be rigorously evaluated and then made publicly available to other researchers."

Yet, if not used responsibly, this same technology can reinforce inequity, limit accountability and infringe on the privacy of individuals: irreproducible results can influence global economic policy; algorithmic changes in search engines can sway elections and incite violence; models based on biased data can legitimize and amplify discrimination in the criminal justice system; algorithmic hiring practices can silently reinforce diversity issues and potentially violate the law; privacy and security violations can erode the trust of users and expose companies to legal and financial consequences. The focus of this project is on using Big Data technology responsibly -- in accordance with ethical and moral norms, and legal and policy considerations. This project establishes a foundational new role for data management technology, in which managing the responsible use of data across the lifecycle becomes a core system requirement. The broader goal of this project is to help usher in a new phase of data science, in which the technology considers not only the accuracy of the model but also ensures that the data on which it depends respect the relevant laws, societal norms, and impacts on humans. <br/><br/>This project defines properties of responsible data management, which include fairness (and the related concepts of representativeness and diversity), transparency (and accountability), and data protection. It complements what is done in the data mining and machine learning communities, where the focus is on analyzing fairness, accountability and transparency of the final step in the data analysis lifecycle, and considers the problems that can be introduced upstream from data analysis: during dataset selection, cleaning, pre-processing, integration, and sharing. This project develops conceptual frameworks and algorithmic techniques that support fairness, transparency and data protection properties through all stages of the data usage lifecycle: beginning with data discovery and acquisition, through cleaning, integration, querying, and ultimately analysis. The contributions are structured along three aims. Aim 1 considers responsible dataset discovery, profiling, and integration. Aim 2 considers responsible query processing and develops a general framework for declarative specification, checking and enforcement of fairness, representativeness and diversity. Aim 3 incorporates data protection into the lifecycle, develops techniques to facilitate sharing of sensitive data, and considers the tradeoffs between privacy and transparency. This project is poised to establish a multidisciplinary research agenda around responsible data management as a critical factor in enabling fairness, accountability and transparency in decision-making and prediction systems.

Although these slow slip earthquakes do not create seismic shaking, recognizing their occurrence is important because they can influence the potential of regular earthquakes and tsunamis. These slow slip earthquakes are sometimes associated with extremely quiet seismic rumblings, but are otherwise identified through continuous Global-Positioning-System monitoring that reveals small motions occurring at dedicated stations. The aim of this study is to evaluate a potential complementary method for identifying these events through the use of groundwater pressure data. As a fault slips, it squishes and relaxes the water saturated rocks below the ground like a sponge. With sensitive instruments within wells / boreholes, the resulting water pressure changes can sometimes be observed. This project seeks to improve the ability and speed at which slow slip earthquakes are detected by incorporating the analysis of groundwater pressure data from existing monitoring facilities along the Cascadia subduction zone within the United States Pacific Northwest. The project will study and robustly identify water pressure changes associated with fault slip and will support graduate students to conduct research as part of the project. The results will be disseminated through published papers and public presentations.<br/><br/>This project will detect and analyze suspected signatures of subduction zone slow slip hidden within continuous pore pressure records from Earthscope's Plate Boundary Observatory borehole array. The science is motivated by an aim to improve our understanding of the temporal and spatial distribution of slow slip within subduction zones. Hydrogeologic signatures of fault slip behavior can provide an additional constraint on large-scale slow slip beyond seismic tremor detections or transients in continuous positioning measurements. Suspected pore pressure signatures of fault slip, however, must be differentiated from unrelated local hydrogeologic disturbances and meteorological effects. This study addresses these issues by analyzing existing borehole pore pressure data during known large-scale slow slip events and uses signal processing and statistical techniques with a variety of data types to improve the robust identification and discrimination of suspected signals. The results are expected to improve our understanding of the hydrogeologic response to fault slip, help further assess the timing and extent of large-scale slow slip events, and potentially provide a real-time statistically-based slow slip detection algorithm independent of continuous positioning data or seismologic observations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Leg amputation is a significant life-altering event that has an overwhelmingly negative effect on many aspects of life, even years after the injury. Leg amputation can cost in excess of $1.8 million per individual. Most available prostheses are designed to replicate some aspects of normal ankle function during level-ground walking. These prostheses allow many individuals with below-knee amputation to return to basic daily activities. However, these devices are best suited for level-ground walking and many users experience difficulties during other important tasks, such as walking on slopes, stairs, or different terrains. Therefore, the general aim of this project is to address this gap in the design of existing powered ankle-foot prostheses by enabling new prosthetics that adapt to different environmental conditions commonly found in daily life. The proposed ankle-foot mechanism significantly enhances the customizability of lower leg-powered prostheses by introducing a new design approach. This project will study how the human ankle stiffness changes during different walking scenarios. The research team will use this information to design a powered ankle-foot prosthesis with properties more similar to the human ankle. In order to do so, a lightweight and modular prosthesis that uses programmable material will be developed. The modular mechanical design and control approach generates human-like characteristics and enables a larger set of users with different lengths of amputated legs to use this prosthesis. Moreover, the prosthesis' performance will be evaluated during real-world activities in dynamic environments. The focus of this project is on amputees' well-being. The resulting agile ankle foot prosthesis will help amputees improve their physical function, ability to work, and recreation, thus helping individuals return to the activities and quality of life they had prior to injury. The research findings from this project can also be applied to advance functions of exoskeletons, orthotics, and rehabilitation robots. In addition to advancing research, undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in research activities and will receive interdisciplinary education/innovation/outreach experiences. Outreach activities will allow the project team to engage diverse middle and high school students in science and engineering, especially those from underrepresented groups and low-income families. <br/><br/>This project plans a new class of customizable agile ankle-foot prosthesis that is modular in design and has its impedance modulation decoupled from its torque control. This will be achieved by equipping a novel and recently developed powered 2-degrees of freedom (DOF) ankle-foot prosthesis with an augmented mechanism built from soft programmable material. The primary outcomes of this project will be a comprehensive understanding of how to 1) reduce the complexity of the control of ankle-foot prostheses, as observed in clinical trials, and 2) enhance prosthesis performance in real-world activities, such as walking and running on surfaces with different profiles, stiffness, and lateral inclinations. The planned work aims to address customizability issues of robotic ankle foot prostheses and address societal impact by improving amputees' quality of life and work. The main goal of this study is to consolidate the impedance control of the ankle to a mechanical module comprised of programmable material to follow the 2-D human ankle impedance. The effort will further integrate the impedance modulation with 2-DOF torque control of the ankle to provide the customizability required for tailoring an agile prosthesis to each user's need in parallel to the torque control tuning. The project researchers hypothesize that real-time control of the two-dimensional ankle impedance in a robotic ankle-foot prosthesis can improve the performance and the agility of the user during walking on surfaces with different profiles, stiffness, and inclinations. The interconnected research thrusts will provide the opportunity to offer a new solution through 1) modeling the ankle dynamics in different gait scenarios, 2) equipping a 2-DOF robotic ankle-foot prosthesis with a programmable material module, and 3) performing extensive evaluation experiments with amputees. Understanding the effect of the control and adaptation of the 2-D ankle impedance during walking with a lower extremity prosthesis will be significantly beneficial for the field of assistive robotics because it can provide guidelines for the design and control of powered prostheses, exoskeletons, and rehabilitation devices. In addition to advancing research, undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in research activities and will receive interdisciplinary education/innovation/outreach experiences. Outreach activities will allow the project team to engage diverse middle and high school students, especially those from underrepresented groups and low-income families.

It hence plays a pivotal role in securing our digital infrastructure, and in enforcing the right for privacy of individuals. The development of secure cryptographic techniques is however difficult and error-prone, as unknown attack strategies need to be taken into account. To overcome this, modern cryptography advocates the paradigm of provable security, where threat models are precisely formalized using the language of mathematics, and the security of cryptosystems is proved within these models. This project aims to develop a better quantitative approach to provable security. The research of this project yields a better understanding of in-use cryptography, therefore contributing to the safer deployment of existing cryptographic solutions, as well as the support of future standardization processes. The educational component of this project includes the development of a comprehensive program to educate undergraduate students in the proper use of cryptography, and to use cryptography as a vehicle for outreach.<br/>				<br/>This project develops better theory to prove rigorous lower bounds on the combination of time and memory needed by the attacker. This allows us to better compare cryptographic solutions, and to favor those which, for equal time resources, require the largest amount of memory in order to be compromised. Concretely, this project contributes along two different fronts. The first direction extends the theory of memory-hard functions, which are functions that are moderately hard to compute with respect to some combination of time and memory resources. This project introduces better hardness metrics as well as new security targets for memory-hard functions, and analyze new constructions. The second direction revisits the security of various schemes in symmetric cryptography, and provides lower bounds on the complexity of adversaries breaking them both in terms of time and memory storage, in the setting where some underlying component of scheme is modeled as ideal."

Cell growth kinetics controlled by cellular metabolism and nuclear structure will be first obtained, which will then be tested and validated by cell line experiments. A novel approach of snapshotting cell growth rate will be developed through imaging ATP production and nuclear structure with quantitative phase and chemometric microscopy. The efficacy of the approach will be assessed in distinguishing aggressive prostate cancer from non-aggressive ones with tissue section measurements. The interplay between function and structure is one central problem in cancer research. This work will provide new insights into understanding this complex interplay. Cancers, such as prostate tumors, can take two distinct disease courses -- indolent or highly aggressive, leading to death if not treated. Clinicians and patients daily must choose a primary treatment modality from surgery, accompanying morbidity and compromised quality of life to watchful waiting, risking life with delayed treatment. Accurate risk stratification of cancer at time of diagnosis to identify those patients at high risk is critically needed to choose the optimal treatment strategy, enable higher life quality for the patient, and reduce the economic burden. The quantitative growth rate as an objective marker for cancer aggressiveness will address this urgent need. The funding will also support the PI to continue his effort in integrating research and education in a primary undergraduate university, and further the cutting-edge research on developing optical techniques for quantifying the static structure and dynamic processes in biological systems and revealing physics of cancer. Undergraduate students will be recruited from Physics, Engineering and Biology majors. Premedical and minority students will be encouraged to participate. Special emphasis will be placed on nurturing and training future scientists and engineers from undergraduate students.

Ordered three-dimensional arrays built from nanoscale building-blocks, often called superlattices, are exciting because new functionalities can emerge from the interactions between individual building-blocks. The use of proteins as building-blocks is a groundbreaking new direction because proteins exhibit a wide range of properties and behavior, including catalytic and immune activities, which are often difficult to realize in synthetic molecules. Making ordered materials by conventional protein crystallization is a laborious procedure and the ability to tailor the structure of protein crystals is limited. This award supports fundamental research to develop versatile and tunable approaches to manufacture superlattice materials constructed of proteins. The availability of these unique protein-based materials impacts diverse industries such as energy, biomedical and catalysis, which advances national welfare. This project uniquely integrates several disciplines including materials science, bioengineering and computational modeling. The integration of experimental and computational approaches in this project impacts research efforts of the Network for Computational Nanotechnology (NCN), synergistically. Alongside the scientific impact of the project, it also leverages the multi-disciplinary approach to promote students, including women and minorities, on this project by acquiring broad skills and knowledge and by providing a positive impact on science education.<br/><br/>The research team envisions that protein cage nanoparticles and linker proteins, which bind non-covalently to symmetry-specific sites on the protein cages, are promising building-blocks for constructing a new class of protein superlattices, i.e. protein macromolecular frameworks. Protein cages have hollow spherical architectures composed of a distinct number of subunits with well-defined symmetry-specific sites. The investigators anticipate that specific binding geometries between protein cages and linkers result in highly regular network structures with a wide range of functionalities. The research team integrates bioengineering and computational modeling approaches to develop a range of linker molecules with different lengths and binding affinities to protein cages. By connecting the protein cages together through protein linkers, they are geometrically confined, thus forming highly regulated structures. The structure of the protein macromolecular frameworks is tunable through the selection of protein cages and specific linker proteins. Additionally, protein macromolecular frameworks have two types of unique spaces internally to accommodate cargo molecules. These are interior cavity of individual protein cages and interstitial space between protein cages within the lattice. The team demonstrates that various cargo molecules, such as enzymes, could be encapsulated inside of the protein cages. In this project, reversible incorporation and release of guest molecules are studied, which could lead protein macromolecular frameworks to practical applications such as drug delivery and catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One way in which this can be done is by having students participate with robots in dramatic play and other student-centered approaches to early childhood education. Programming, and, by consequence, debugging, is critical to the ability to control robot movements. It also contributes to the development of problem-solving skills. It is unreasonable to expect early grades students to gain these skills without being helped by a teacher who has the ability and self-efficacy to engage in debugging. In this three year, collaborative research project, this Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) Exploration and Design project will prototype and research the effectiveness of strategies to help pre-service, early childhood education teachers learn to debug block-based programming. In so doing, the project has the potential to invite members of a population that is overwhelmingly female (early childhood education pre-service teachers) to participate in computer science, a field in which women are drastically under-represented. It also has the potential to positively influence the teaching of computer science in the early grades among students who are from low-resourced settings or from ethnic minority backgrounds - a very important goal for both social justice and ensuring the widest possible talent pool for the computer science workforce of the future. This aligns with the goals of NSF's IUSE program in that it seeks to enhance STEM education processes and outcomes among pre-service, early childhood teachers, who often suffer from weak STEM education preparation.<br/><br/>The specific project aims are (a) to determine the nature of the motivational and cognitive challenges that impede successful and efficient debugging among pre-service early childhood teachers, and (b) match scaffolding techniques with specific learner characteristics to promote successful and efficient debugging among pre-service early childhood teachers. To address these aims, the project team will engage in 5 studies - (1) an exploratory study of cognitive and motivational challenges that impede successful and efficient debugging among pre-service early childhood teachers, (2) meta-synthesis of exploratory studies (including pilot studies prior to this project) and clusters of participants according to challenges, (3) data mining of a scaffolding meta-analysis dataset and prototyping scaffolding strategies, and (4-5) implementation studies of scaffolding prototypes. Furthermore, the project team will disseminate results to (a) university educators through workshops and webinars, and (b) STEM education researchers through publication of peer-reviewed journal articles.  This important work is supported with funding from the IUSE program and the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program."

The timing of sex change in these animals is often related to body size, so populations typically consist of many small fish of the initial sex (usually female) and few large fish of the other sex (usually male). In nature, smaller fish are at a greater risk of mortality due to predation, but fishermen tend to seek larger fish. Thus fishing that targets larger individuals may skew sex ratios,  removing enough of the larger sex to hinder reproduction. However, the extent to which size-selective mortality affects sex-changing fishes is poorly understood. This research will explore the effects of size-selective mortality on the population dynamics of sex-changing species using an integrated set of field experiments and mathematical models. It will provide the first experimental exploration of the sensitivity of different sex-change patterns and reproductive strategies to selective mortality. The results will advance our knowledge of the susceptibility and resilience of sex-changing organisms to different types of size-selective mortality and will reveal how sex-changing species can recover after size-selection ceases, as in populations within marine reserves where fishing is suddenly prohibited. The findings will inform fisheries management policies, which do not currently consider the ability of a species to change sex in setting fisheries regulations. The project will provide professional training and research support for three graduate students and multiple undergraduates from California State University Northridge, Moss Landing Marine Laboratories, and University of North Carolina Wilmington. The research findings will be communicated with fisheries managers, via national and international scientific meetings, posted on institutional websites and social media, and through publicly available modeling exercises.<br/><br/>This project will consist of a three-year study of the effects of size-specific mortality on sex-changing fishes. Field experiments will use three closely related rocky-reef fishes that differ in sex-change pattern and are amenable to field manipulation and direct measurement of reproductive output. The species include a protogynous hermaphrodite (a female-to-male sex-change pattern common among harvested species) and two simultaneous hermaphrodites that differ in their ability to switch between male and female. Two types of experiments will be conducted on populations established on replicate patch reefs at Santa Catalina Island, California: (1) sex ratios will be manipulated to determine when the scarcity of males limits population-level reproductive output; and (2) experiments cross-factoring the intensity of mortality with the form of size-selection (i.e., higher mortality of large or small individuals) will test the demographic consequences of size-selective mortality.  In concert with the field experiments, size- and sex-structured population models (integral projection models) will be developed for use in three ways: (1) to evaluate how different types of selective mortality should affect population dynamics; (2) to predict outcomes of the field experiments, testing/validating the model and allowing direct prediction of the ecological significance of short-term selection; and (3) to fit to existing survey data for a fourth species, a widely fished, sex-changing fish, inside and outside of marine reserves. Part (3) will evaluate whether and how quickly the mating system and reproductive output of that species (not directly measurable in the field) is recovering inside reserves. This integrated set of field experiments and models will yield novel insight into the effects of size-selective mortality on the population dynamics of sex-changing marine species."

The Arctic Ocean may represent an important source of nitrous oxide to the atmosphere. High nitrous oxide saturations were recently observed in productive shallow Arctic shelf waters. The proposed research will test the hypotheses that productive shelf regions of the Western Arctic Ocean (e.g., Chukchi and Beaufort seas) stimulates nitrous oxide production and contributes to offshore transport of nitrous oxide toward the central Arctic. <br/><br/>Besides developing an important baseline data set for the Arctic science community, this project will contribute to STEM workforce development in numerous manners.  It will support an early-career female scientist during the formative years of her career.  It will provide summer educational research opportunities to undergraduate students.  It will develop seminars for elementary school teachers and provide short classroom presentations at a local public school and contribute to an afterschool non-profit effort devoted to providing high quality educational programs to at risk youth.<br/><br/>The primary goal of this proposed research is to evaluate nitrous oxide cycling in the Western Arctic Ocean from its concentrations, stable isotopes and isotopomers. The project will use isotopic and isotopomer measurements from both shelf and offshore waters to constrain estimates of nitrous oxide cycling in the Arctic. The data will be used to evaluate 1) the pathways of nitrous oxide production from either nitrification following organic matter decomposition in the water column or coupled nitrification-denitrification in the sediments and 2) how these processes influence nitrous oxide exchanges between the surface layer and the atmosphere. Comparisons of observations at coastal and shelf stations in the Bering and Chukchi seas with those offshore in the Deep Canadian Basin will allow the evaluation of the effects of mixing and long-range transport on geochemical signals. The measurements will also serve as a baseline for future assessment of change.  The project profits from leveraging of other investments by NSF and the principal investigators? international collaborators, benefitting from measurements and samples collected during the U.S. GEOTRACES Arctic section and the 2016 CHINARE Arctic cruises."

The first is the motion of Earth's plates relative to one another due to convection of the underlying mantle and the force balance on the plate - we call this ""plate tectonics"". The second mechanism is motion of all of the plates together due to shifting mass anomalies within the Earth and associated rotational imbalance, which can cause reorientation relative to Earth's spin axis. This reorientation motion is referred to as true polar wander, and the rate at it proceeds is dependent on the viscosity of Earth's interior, which is poorly constrained both today and through Earth History. This research targets a particular interval of time around 800 million years ago when it has been proposed that true polar wander was much faster than usual -fast enough that parts of Earth's surface may have moved the distance of the length of football field in around 100 years. The PIs seek to track ancient plate movement in Mongolia and China to test this hypothesis using rocks of this age. They will do so using the magnetic directions preserved in the ancient rocks combined with U/Pb radiogenic isotope dates to precisely determine their age. These data will be used constrain both the rate that plates were moving and the relative movement of different plates in order to determine if the motion is consistent with rapid true polar wander. The results will inform Earth Scientists about the drivers of apparent plate motion at this time and the past position of the continents. The data also have the potential to place constraints on the viscosity of Earth's interior through time.<br/><br/>It has been proposed that large-scale, oscillatory true polar wander (TPW) occurred at ca. 800 Ma, associated with a carbon isotope interval known as the Bitter Springs Stage. Recent advances have led to a temporally quantified framework for the Bitter Springs Stage that enables this TPW hypothesis to be tested in non-carbonate-bearing lithologies, such as successions of extrusive volcanics. This project seeks to test the hypothesis through the development of new paleomagnetic and geochronological data from Mongolia and South China. The goal of the research is to robustly quantify Earth's rotational stability through this critical period of Earth history and allow for rates of TPW to be constrained. The Bitter Springs TPW hypothesis has become a central component of models for how continents aggregate into supercontinents, for fundamental inferences into the viscosity of Earth's mantle and the stabilizing effect of the remanent bulge and excess ellipticity, and for the planetary context of Neoproterozoic environmental change. Furthermore, the hypothesis of rapid TPW at ca. 800 Ma has become a significant component of models for the configuration of the supercontinent Rodinia. This project seeks to constrain the rate of pole movement during this interval through the development of new geochronological and paleomagnetic data from the Zavkhan Volcanics of Mongolia and the Banxi Group of South China in robust stratigraphic context. Importantly, these successions contain: (1) abundant volcanic rocks containing zircon from which high-precision U-Pb chemical abrasion-ion dilution-thermal mass spectrometry (CA-ID-TIMS) dates can be obtained and (2) paleomagnetic confidence tests indicating preservation of primary magnetization. Three years of field work, paleomagnetic analysis, and the development of CA-ID-TIMS U-Pb dates will focus on producing high quality pole paths for the Zavkhan Terrane of Mongolia and the South China craton from ca. 820 to 750 Ma. Such paths can be used to further test whether rapid oscillatory TPW occurred through this interval and, if so, at what rates. Testing and constraining this hypothesis is necessary for progress on the co-evolution of the solid earth and the surface through the time period and determining whether there were time periods in the Precambrian where it can be robustly shown that rates of TPW were higher than those resolved in the Phanerozoic. The broader impacts of the proposed research are four-fold: (1) the training and development of a UC Berkeley graduate student; (2) engagement of undergraduate students in basic research; (3) cultural exchange with Mongolian students in the field and in both of the PIs labs and (4) effective communication of a set of Earth systems history learning goals to K-12 communities through the construction of an educational display module in conjunction with the Harvard Museum of Natural History (HMNH). This educational exhibit will be focused on the geological record of Asia and will include: (1) large rock samples that can be touched; (2) photographs from field expeditions; (3) educational displays about geochronology and paleomagnetism; and (4) a video explaining the geophysical techniques used in this study. Following display in the Earth Science exhibit galleries at HMNH, the exhibit module will travel for display in the Earth and Planetary Science Department at UC Berkeley and then to the Mongolia University for Science and Technology in Ulaanbaatar.

High biodiversity is often associated with a division of resources that allows many types of organisms to coexist with minimal competition. Indeed, unlike many other organisms on coral reefs, sponges are adapted to efficiently remove bacteria, phytoplankton, and dissolved organic matter from seawater by filter-feeding. Sponges are a dominant component of coral reefs worldwide and in the Caribbean, where their biomass exceeds that of reef-building corals. For almost a quarter century, the success of sponges in the Caribbean has been linked to their filter-feeding ability. However, recent work demonstrated that coexisting sponges on Caribbean reefs host unique communities of bacteria that might allow sponges to access multiple pools of nutrients that are not available to other organisms. In this project, the investigators will test the hypothesis that ecologically dominant sponge species in the Caribbean have unique metabolic strategies that are mediated by their associations with microbes that live within the sponge body. This research will combine manipulative field experiments with a novel combination of modern analytical tools to investigate both filter-feeding by sponge hosts and the metabolic pathways of their microbes.  This work will advance our understanding of the ecological and evolutionary forces that have helped shape the species present on Caribbean coral reefs. Additionally, this project will support three early-career investigators and provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students at Nova Southeastern University, Appalachian State University, Stony Brook University, and Smithsonian Marine Station. The investigators will also develop innovative outreach programs that expand existing platforms at their institutions to increase public engagement and scientific literacy. <br/><br/>Marine sponges have been widely successful in their expansion across ecological niches in the Caribbean, with biomass often exceeding that of reef-building corals and high species diversity.  However, whether this success is linked to efficient heterotrophic filter-feeding on organic carbon in the water column or to their evolutionary investment in microbial symbionts is yet to be fully elucidated. Microbial symbionts expand the metabolic capabilities of host sponges, supplementing heterotrophic feeding with inorganic carbon and nitrogen, mediating the assimilation of dissolved organic matter, and facilitating recycling of host-derived nitrogen.  Despite these benefits, microbial symbiont communities are widely divergent across coexisting sponge species and there is substantial variation in host reliance on symbiont-derived carbon and nitrogen among host sponges; therefore, these associations likely mediate the ecological diversification of coexisting sponge species. The goal of this project is to test this transformative hypothesis by adopting an integrative approach to assess the individual components of holobiont metabolism (i.e., microbial symbionts and sponge host) in ten of the most common sponge species in the Caribbean. The investigators will isolate autotrophic and heterotrophic metabolic pathways and explore potential links between microbial symbiont community composition and the assimilation of particulate and dissolved organic matter (POM and DOM) from seawater. This project will elucidate whether Caribbean sponge species are on similar or divergent evolutionary trajectories, and will provide information that is critical for our understanding of how conditions in the Caribbean basin have shaped the evolution of benthic organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While investigating wave-like processes, it is important to understand how the waves form, how they travel, whether they form a stable or an unstable structure, and if certain initial conditions lead to formation of singularities (like tsunamis, rogue waves, or rough turbulence). Understanding the evolution in time of such processes via various mathematical models is a goal of this project, and it will include studying various wave phenomena with or without stochastic elements. These wave-type phenomena are fundamental in nature, yet we are still at the dawn of their full analytical and numerical descriptions. This project is aimed at advancing the frontiers of the science of wave phenomena with applications to the real-life manifestations in nature. Students at all levels, from undergraduate to post-doctoral, will be involved in this research and receive training for their careers.<br/> <br/>The project is aimed at understanding the global behavior of solutions to nonlinear stochastic and deterministic dispersive partial differential equations, where the nonlinearities cause a significant difference in global behavior compared with the linear time evolution. One such nonlinear structure is a solitary wave, or soliton, which has a specific shape, exists (in the mathematical sense) for all time and in some equations travels in particular directions, while in other equations it oscillates periodically. Whether such a structure is stable or unstable and how it might be influenced by the external random perturbations is important in applications, and if unstable, it is important to investigate what it leads to. Typically, instability (the case when solitons are unstable) means that a singularity will form: for example, a freak wave in the ocean or a self-focusing burn in laser optics. Thus, it is very important to investigate the question of soliton stability, which is to be studied in this project in both stochastic and deterministic settings and via analytical and numerical approaches. A special thrust will be given to the study of formation of singularities, for example, collapses and concentrations. The research program starts from advancing the soliton stability theory as well as understanding the singularity formation process for the stochastic generalized Korteweg-de Vries equation, then progressing to one of its higher dimensional generalization (the little explored even in pure deterministic case but important in quantum mechanics and fluid dynamics) Zakharov-Kuznetsov equation, where questions of asymptotic stability, existence and the description of singularities is proposed for investigation. Using the analytical and numerical techniques the nonlinear Hartree equation with the non-local potential will be investigated, with the special emphasis on understanding the spectral structure. This type of equation arises in general relativity as well as in quantum mechanics, and so is important to study in that context. Finally, questions of description of global behavior of solutions in a wave-type equation, such as the nonlinear Klein-Gordon equation, will be investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such disturbances can have profound impacts on the structure of ecological communities (e.g. species diversity and abundance) and on the ecosystem services that those communities provide. Given the potential significance of such changes for human well-being, it is essential that we develop effective tools to predict these ecological and ecosystem impacts. Traditionally, the study of the resilience of ecological communities to severe environmental perturbations (e.g. hurricanes, floods) has focused on ecological processes. However, there is mounting evidence that feedbacks between the ecological and evolutionary processes (eco-evolutionary feedbacks) occur over commensurate time scales. This raises the possibility that evolutionary processes may play an important role in community resilience and species persistence. This project tackles the challenges posed by this possibility by developing a mathematical framework for analyzing models of disturbance which account for eco-evolutionary feedbacks and applying this framework to two real world systems whose properties have not been synthetically treated. In addition, this project will also support multiple outreach activities to K-12 education. <br/><br/>The investigators will develop new analytical methods models accounting for environmental stochasticity, eco-evolutionary feedbacks, and demographic stochasticity. Stochastic difference equations (SDEs) will be used to model eco-evolutionary feedbacks in disturbed habitats. For these SDEs, new methods will be developed for verifying persistence of species and exponential rates of convergence to positive stationary distributions (which provides a measure of resilience). For models also accounting for finite population sizes, large deviation methods will be used to prove that stochastic persistence for the mean field SDE implies that the mean time to extinction of any species or genotype increases exponentially with habitat size, and the meta-stable behavior of the system dynamics are characterized by the positive stationary distributions of the mean field SDE. These mathematical methods will be applied to a nested set of common models associated with two prominent empirical systems: Anolis lizards on Bahamian Islands recovering from hurricanes, and stickleback fish in streams on Vancouver Island recovering from catastrophic floods. Using such different model systems provides the unique opportunity to more readily find generalities and plays to the two systems' complementary experimental strengths. Field experiments and observations as well as existing data will be used to parameterize the individual-based eco-evolutionary models.

In the year 2010, US already had 40.3 million people aged 65 and older (accounting for 13 percent of total population). The ratio is projected to reach 20.9 percent by 2050. In this research, a novel class of wireless biomedical implants will be investigated for sensitive, long-term monitoring of physiological parameters in human bodies, needed for managing chronic diseases (e.g. eye disease, heart failure, or brain injury), and for improving patients' quality of life. Battery-free implantable sensors have been growing rapidly in clinical uses because they have advantages of zero power consumption, potentially allowing for long-lifetime and maintenance-free operation. Nonetheless, one of the primary challenges for these implantable sensors lies in how to accurately and robustly detect physiological parameters from electrically-lossy small sensors using radio-frequency (RF) signals. The proposed parity-time (PT)-symmetric wireless sensor system will enable new ways to manipulate the RF interrogation between the implantable microsensor and the external reader, aiming to realize wireless sensing and detection with high sensitivity, high sensing resolution, and large modulation depth. The educational impact of this proposed project will also be significant. The integrated outreach program will be effective due to the visually appealing nature of micro-/nano-devices, sensors, and circuits. The PIs will develop new courses and outreach activities in Michigan Science Center and Wayne State University's established channels, including ReBUILDetroit Program and Richard Barber Interdisciplinary Research Program, for recruiting under-represented minorities in the Detroit area.<br/><br/>The goal of this research project is to experimentally demonstrate the generalized PT-symmetry theory in RF and microwave electronics, as well as their envisaged applications in high-performance wireless sensors. The sensitivity and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) of the passive wireless micro-/nano-sensors are often hindered by low modal quality factor (Q-factor), due to the limited space and power dissipations associated with the skin effect, dielectric losses, eddy currents, and etc. The concept of PT-symmetry (spatial inversion and time-reversal symmetry) was first discovered in quantum theory, and has recently become an active research area in fundamental physics, including optics, acoustics, and electromagnetism. A telemetry system with its equivalent-circuit topology obeying the PT-symmetry has not yet been investigated for biotelemetry and wireless sensing applications (13.56 MHz - low GHz). This new telemetry system, although having a non-Hermitian Hamiltonian, may exhibit purely real eigenfrequencies that lead to sharp and deep resonances, with the effective quality factor (Q-factor) beyond limitations for passive systems, in which conventional loop-antenna is deployed as a reader. A sharp, narrowband reflection peak has been a long-sought goal for telemetric sensor systems, because of its substantial implications for superior detection and low cumulative noises. If successful, the proposed PT-symmetric wireless sensor system will resolve the long-standing problem of low Q-factor and limited sensitivity in wireless microelectromechanical and nanotechnological sensors, composed of inductor-capacitor (LC) resonators with miniaturized footprints. This proposed research will advance fundamental knowledge in biomedical implants, wearable electronics, medical diagnosis, healthcare internet of things (IoT), microwave imaging, wireless communication, and non-Hermitian PT-symmetric physics."

In all these computations, the step that tends to be the most time-consuming, and which therefore limits how large problems can be solved, concerns the manipulation of large square or rectangular arrays of numbers, called ""matrices"". Many of the matrices that arise in practical applications have redundancies, and can be compressed to enable them to be stored using less space. Using the compressed format, computations involving the matrix can also be greatly accelerated. The problems that will be addressed are deterministic in nature, but the algorithms that will be developed are probabilistic. It turns out that by exploiting certain mathematical properties of large ensembles of independent random numbers, one can build algorithms for compressing matrices that are much faster than traditional deterministic techniques. The new randomized algorithms can in theory fail, but the likelihood of failure can be shown to  be lower than 1 time out of 10,000,000,000 runs in typical applications. Randomized algorithms of this type have recently attracted much interest due to the fact that they perform  particularly well on emerging computing platforms such as mobile computing (where conserving energy is the key priority), computing using graphical processor units (where the vast numbers of computational cores create challenges), and distributed memory parallel computers. The methods also perform very well when applied  to massively large datasets that must be stored on hard drives, or on large server farms. The project will train one doctoral student, and will lead to the release of a publicly available software package that implements the methods that will be developed. <br/><br/>From a technical point of view, the objective of the project is to develop efficient algorithms for factorizing matrices and for solving large linear systems of algebraic equations. The algorithms will be based on randomized sampling, and will exploit remarkable mathematical properties of random matrices and random orthogonal projections. Such randomized algorithms require less communication  than traditional methods, which makes them particularly attractive for modern applications involving multicore processors, distributed computing, out-of-core computing, etc. Specifically, the project will address the following problems: (1) Computing full matrix factorizations (e.g. the so called ""column pivoted QR factorization"") which are core building blocks in scientific computing. Preliminary numerical experiments demonstrate speed-ups of close to an order of magnitude compared to state-of-the-art software packages. (2) Solving linear systems involving many unknowns and many equations. We expect to achieve substantial practical acceleration, and are cautiously optimistic about the possibility to develop solvers with substantially better asymptotic complexity than the cubic complexity achieved by standard techniques. (3) Developing randomized methods for accelerating computational simulations of phenomena such as electro-statics, composite materials, biochemical processes, slow fluid flows, Gaussian processes in 2 and 3 dimensions, etc. Technically, this will be achieved by developing randomized methods for compressing so called ""data-sparse"" or ""rank-structured"" matrices."

This integration drastically increases the size of the data sets that need to be analyzed to make biological conclusions.  However, existing tools yield low accuracy and exhibit poor scalability for big proteogenomics data.  This CAREER grant is expected to lay a foundation for fast algorithmic and high performance computing solutions suitable for analyzing big proteogenomics data sets.  Design of accurate computational algorithms suitable for peta-scale data sets will be pursued and the software implementation will run on massively parallel supercomputers and graphical processing units.  The direction in this CAREER proposal is towards designing and building infrastructure, which would be useful for the broadest biological and ecological community.  A comprehensive interdisciplinary education will be executed for K12, undergraduate and graduate students to ensure that US retains its global leadership position in STEM fields.  This project thus serves the national interest, as stated by NSF's mission: to promote the progress of science and to advance the national health, prosperity and welfare.<br/><br/>The goal of the proposed CAREER grant is to design and develop algorithmic and high performance computing (HPC) foundations for practical sublinear and parallel algorithms for big proteogenomics data - especially for non-model organisms with previously unsequenced or partially sequenced genomes.  Integration of MS and NGS data sets required for proteogenomics studies exhibit enormous volume and velocity of data: NGS technologies such as Chip-Seq can generate tera-bytes of DNA/RNA data and mass spectrometers can generate millions of spectra (with thousand of peak per spectra).  The current systems for analyzing MS data are mainly driven by heuristic practices and do not scale well.  This CAREER proposal will explore a new class of reductive algorithms for analysis of MS data that can allow peptide deductions in sublinear time, compression algorithms that operate in sub-linear space, and denovo algorithms that operate on lossy reduced-form of the MS data.  Novel low-complexity sampling and reductive algorithms that can exploit the sparsity of MS data such as non-uniform FFT based convolution kernels can lead to superior similarity metrics not prone to spurious correlations.  The bottleneck in large system-biology studies is the low-scalability of coarse-grained parallel algorithms that do not exploit MS-specific data characteristics and lead to unbalanced loads due to non-uniform compute time required for peptide deductions.  This project aims to explore design and implementation of scalable algorithms for both NGS and MS data on multicore and GPU platforms using domain decomposition techniques based on spectral clustering, MS-specific hybrid load-balancing based on work-load estimate, and HPC dimensionality reduction strategies and novel out-of-core sketching & streaming fine-grained parallel algorithms.  These HPC solutions can enable previously impractical proteogenomics projects and allow biologists to perform computational experiments without needing expensive hardware.  All of the implemented algorithms will be made available as open-source code interfaced with Galaxy framework to ensure maximum impact in systems biology labs.  These designed techniques will then be integrated so that matching of spectra to RNA-Seq data can be accomplished without a reconstructed transcriptome.  The proposed tools aim to reveal new biological insight such as novel genes, proteins and PTM's and are crucial steps towards understanding the genomic, proteomic and evolutionary aspects of species in the tree of life."

The full nature of this protective effect, however, is less well understood. A major barrier to understanding is the fact that almost nothing is known about the factors that influence the considerable variation in milk composition around the globe, or about the effects of this variation on infant health. This INSPIRE project represents the first comprehensive investigation of the global differences in human milk composition along with the various microbial, evolutionary, environmental, and sociocultural factors that might influence both milk composition and infant health. An international, interdisciplinary collaboration of physiologists, nutritional scientists, anthropologists, microbiologists, and mathematicians will collect biological data from breastfeeding women and their infants, in concert with extensive anthropologic and ecological data, in both developed (US, Spain, Sweden) and developing countries (Central African Republic, Gambia, Ghana, Peru, and Kenya). To test the possibility of a correlation between milk oligosaccharide composition, milk microbiota, and the gastrointestinal microbiome of infants, milk samples and infant fecal samples will be analyzed using state-of-the-art biochemical and genomic techniques.   This study will allow important cross-cultural comparisons of milk composition and infant feeding practices; it also will utilize sophisticated computational methods to integrate the extensive, diverse body of combined biological and anthropological data to elucidate the relationships among sociocultural factors, evolutionary history, environmental exposures, microbial constituents and milk composition. The researchers predict that what is considered ""normal"" milk composition in one population may not support optimal health in another. This information is crucial to the humanitarian quest to understand how infant nutrition and overall health can be improved around the world. In addition, this project will provide extensive research training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate and postdoctoral scientists."

The objective of this project is to bring innovations to mobile video delivery for new content types and over emerging networks. Specifically, the project investigates three aspects: (1) 360-degree immersive video delivery, (2) video streaming over multiple network paths (multipath), and (3) video streaming over millimeter-wave (mmWave) links. These are expected to be the key building blocks of next-generation video streaming services.  First, 360-degree videos provide users with unique panoramic viewing experience; however, 360-degree video content delivery is much more challenging compared to regular videos. Second, multiple network interfaces have become a norm on off-the-shelf mobile devices but their potential is far from being fully exploited. Third, mmWave is a key technology that will be integrated into 5G wireless networks; but adapting video streaming to mmWave largely remains an uncharted territory. The proposed solutions will benefit the society by enhancing the user experience and reducing the resource consumption for next-generation immersive video services. The research will also be integrated with an education plan that seeks to prepare computer science students with the knowledge of new technological trends in networking and systems, and stimulate the general public interest in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics.<br/><br/>This project includes three inter-connected research thrusts. (1) For 360 video streaming, based on the concept of field-of-view (FoV) guided streaming, the project uses big data analytics to facilitate accurate head movement prediction, a key prerequisite for FoV-guided streaming. It also uses a rate adaptation scheme with a ""delta encoding"" design allowing the quality of a fetched chunk to be incrementally upgraded. This substantially improves adaptability when facing randomness in head movements. (2) For multipath streaming, the project uses multiple network interfaces to be used simultaneously for streaming videos. The network framework supports video rate adaptation and allows users to flexibly configure each path's cost. The framework also supports delay-sensitive live streaming over multipath through strategic packet scheduling. (3) mmWave links bear unique characteristics of massive capacity and intermittent availability. The project first designs a transport layer for mmWave links. It then proposes several video streaming strategies tailored to mmWave, such as strategically combining mmWave and legacy omni-directional radios.  For the above research thrusts, the project will develop algorithms, models, and systems, backed up by real implementation and evaluation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, the objective of this research project is to develop a sensor device that can detect biomarkers for lung cancer cells accurately.  The overall system integrates a microdevice, called a microtoroid resonator, with a very small gold particle, that has a diameter of about twenty nanometers, coated with DNA that can capture biomarkers for lung cancer cells.

Nanoscale defects in microtoroids are well-suited for the incorporation of biorecognition elements to capture ncRNAs at low concentrations. The planned research strategy will translate the strengths of novel transcriptome profiling data developed from the whole-genome transcriptome into simpler screening tests, and thus bridge the gap between basic research and patient care. It is expected to produce a new point-of-care (POC) test using the microtoroid-based photonic biosensor, for accurate and multiplexed detection of ncRNAs in sputum, which is a convenient human body fluid for non-invasive diagnostics. Importantly, the photonic biosensor platform will have several advantages over existing techniques.  1) It is a label-free, amplification-free method and can provide a rapid method for ncRNA detection.  2) The sensor platform can monitor multiple targets simultaneously.  3) It can significantly reduce the hands-on time and reaction time for multiple miRNA detections compared to traditional techniques involving thermal cycling and microfluidic system, because it utilizes capture probes for direct ncRNA detection.  4) It does not require temperature cycling."

This will be accomplished by using inertial power scavenging design by converting interstitial glucose into energy through the coupling of enzymes and three-dimensional nanowire arrays to potentially power ultra-low power implantable glucose monitors. <br/><br/>Intellectual Merit: Continuous, self-powered monitoring of glucose in diabetics is quite important and will save lives. The proposed self-powered biosensing microsystem will monitor sugar levels and it embodies two key new contributions: (1) The approach eliminates the need for a potentiostat circuit and an external power source or batteries, thus leading to dramatic improvements in both speed and energy efficiency. Enzyme biofuel cells based on three-dimensional nanowire anodes fused with an energy harvesting circuit and a capacitor will provide integrated devices that will sense input potential and step up the electric power to operate a light emitting diode. (2) The work is both innovative and transformational, since it will provide an autonomous, self-powered, low-power biosensing microsystem. The biosensing microsystem will generate a drive signal in real-time and periodically power an electrical device solely by generating and accumulating electrical power in the capacitor as a result of the catalysis of glucose oxidation.<br/><br/>Broad Impact: Both the research and educational objectives have a significant broader impact.<br/>The research addresses a crucial problem in diabetes treatment - a self-powered biosensing microsystem for continuous monitoring of blood glucose. The combination of the two areas; nanowire enzyme-based biofuel cell and biosensing system; can usher in a new era in self-powered biosensor microsystems for glucose monitoring. Demonstration of a self-powered, stable, continuous, long-term biosensing microsystem for glucose could lead to improvement in the quality of life for people with diabetes. The educational component enriches and complements other programs at UMBC that are designed to increase minority and female participation in math and science. The exposure of these students to a real-world problem and its solution will enable them to better appreciate the contribution of scientific research.<br/>"

Unfortunately, eye trackers have limited features and functionality, which need to be augmented to effectively study the behavior of software developers performing programming and contextual tasks. Eye tracking devices only allow scientists to study fixed, limited-size, stimuli (e.g., block of text or image). Studies normally require that the text fit on one screen (or page). There is very limited or no support to allow such things as scrolling through longer documents or switching back and forth between documents on a computer. While this is sufficient to study how people read one line of code or a sentence it is wholly inadequate to study how programmers attempt to comprehend or develop a large software system.<br/><br/>The objective of the research is to address this limitation and drastically expand the types and size of stimuli that can be studied using an eye tracking device. In addition to supporting source code artifacts, it also supports artifacts such as stack overflow documents, bug reports, testing documents, and requirements.This enables software engineering researchers to conduct large-scale realistic eye-tracking studies seamlessly within a software development environment.  This eye-tracking-enabled infrastructure for studying program comprehension has the potential to transform the way lab studies and field studies are designed and executed as it advances the state of the art in conducting eye tracking studies in software engineering.  The infrastructure directly impacts society by paving the way to further improve IDEs to support the developer in various software engineering tasks through the various research projects it facilitates. The immediate impact is to facilitate controlled laboratory and field environments for a community of researchers. The research may lead to software development tools that incorporate eye-tracking as part of a more productive programming environment leading to higher quality software."

One way in which this can be done is by having students participate with robots in dramatic play and other student-centered approaches to early childhood education. Programming, and, by consequence, debugging, is critical to the ability to control robot movements. It also contributes to the development of problem-solving skills. It is unreasonable to expect early grades students to gain these skills without being helped by a teacher who has the ability and self-efficacy to engage in debugging. In this three year, collaborative research project, this Improving Undergraduate STEM Education (IUSE) Exploration and Design project will prototype and research the effectiveness of strategies to help pre-service, early childhood education teachers learn to debug block-based programming. In so doing, the project has the potential to invite members of a population that is overwhelmingly female (early childhood education pre-service teachers) to participate in computer science, a field in which women are drastically under-represented. It also has the potential to positively influence the teaching of computer science in the early grades among students who are from low-resourced settings or from ethnic minority backgrounds - a very important goal for both social justice and ensuring the widest possible talent pool for the computer science workforce of the future. This aligns with the goals of NSF's IUSE program in that it seeks to enhance STEM education processes and outcomes among pre-service, early childhood teachers, who often suffer from weak STEM education preparation.<br/><br/>The specific project aims are (a) to determine the nature of the motivational and cognitive challenges that impede successful and efficient debugging among pre-service early childhood teachers, and (b) match scaffolding techniques with specific learner characteristics to promote successful and efficient debugging among pre-service early childhood teachers. To address these aims, the project team will engage in 5 studies - (1) an exploratory study of cognitive and motivational challenges that impede successful and efficient debugging among pre-service early childhood teachers, (2) meta-synthesis of exploratory studies (including pilot studies prior to this project) and clusters of participants according to challenges, (3) data mining of a scaffolding meta-analysis dataset and prototyping scaffolding strategies, and (4-5) implementation studies of scaffolding prototypes. Furthermore, the project team will disseminate results to (a) university educators through workshops and webinars, and (b) STEM education researchers through publication of peer-reviewed journal articles.  This important work is supported with funding from the IUSE program and the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program."

Some salient features of these diverse phenomena can be described by mathematical models based on reaction-advection-diffusion equations that have been used extensively to investigate fundamental and ubiquitous phenomena in several areas of biology, and more recently in the social sciences.  While these models are simplified versions of reality, their mathematical analysis has contributed to the understanding of many important phenomena. At the same time, the underlying equations can be extremely interesting and challenging from the mathematical point of view as their solutions can exhibit rich behaviors, e.g., pattern formation and traveling wave structures. The behavior of solutions reflects critical features of the system that mathematics models and have clear and convincing parallels with the evolution of real-world systems. However, there is still a large gap between real world systems and their more tractable mathematical models.  One of the goals of this project is bridging this gap through the use of accumulated concrete data and the corresponding calibration and modification of mathematical models.  Of particular importance is the analysis of systems which include heterogeneous environments, the understanding of the effects that non-local dispersal has on the behavior of the solutions, and the validation of these models with real-world data.  Efforts will be focused on four reaction-advection-diffusion systems where the heterogeneities are due to: climate change in an ecological context, non-local and asymmetrical spread of information in the context of riots, income heterogeneities in the context of social segregation, and environment heterogeneities due to specific concentrated inputs.  The primary goal of the project is to understand how heterogeneous environments and non-local dispersal impact solution patterns in both a general class of nonlinear reaction-diffusion equations as well in specific ecological and social contexts.  Throughout this project the investigators will maintain and foster contacts with social scientists in order to conduct the much needed discourse between the mathematical theory and the applications.     <br/><br/>This project will focus on the development of an extensive theory for reaction-advection-diffusion systems in heterogeneous environments with applications in ecology and sociology.  In particular, the objective of this research is three-fold: to expand the current mathematical theory for local and non-local reaction-advection-diffusion systems in heterogeneous environments, to gain insight into various (ecological, sociological, and biological) complex systems by modeling them using these types of systems, and to  take an initial step toward bridging the gap between basic mathematical models and the complex real-world systems they aim to describe by incorporating the use of data. From the qualitative perspective, this work will be mainly concerned with exploring the effects that various dispersal mechanism have on the propagation (and lack thereof) of a solution in a heterogeneous environment: for example, determining the spreading speed, the existence of traveling wave solutions, pulsating fronts, traveling pulses, or generalized fronts in heterogeneous systems.  Additionally, the fundamental issues of the global well-posedness of solutions to these systems, intermediate and long-term asymptotics, and existence and uniqueness of non-trivial steady-state solutions will be rigorously analyzed."

However, the drive towards renewable energy, power electronics, and changes in fuel costs are fundamentally altering the energy landscape. Significant cost and environmental benefits would result from a holistic study of transmission planning at the national scale, based on a high-fidelity modeling of the grid and accurate forecasting models for renewable energy. The goal of this project is to realize a step change in the fidelity, scalability, and performance of transmission planning systems. The research will have scientific as well as broad societal and educational impact. The project will also pioneer methodologies for solving important problems in energy optimization and management, and generate both short-term and long-term technical impacts. Moreover, the research results will be disseminated through education initiatives. Several education plans, including promoting K-12 education and participation of female and underrepresented minority groups in science and engineering, will be undertaken through involvement in various initiatives at the University of Michigan. <br/><br/>This research proposes a new generation of transmission planning systems to amplify the benefits of renewable energy, while addressing the challenges created by increasing stochasticity and power electronics. The project relies on high-fidelity models of the grid and novel, hierarchical predictive models for renewable energy and substation loads that capture complex spatio-temporal correlations that are critical in obtaining realistic characterizations of uncertainties. The project brings together four PI and Co-PIs with their expertise in power system optimization, uncertainty quantification, algorithm design, and large-scale distributed computing. It proposes multi-stage stochastic programs over various risk and robustness measures for transmission planning and adopts a prioritization methodology to express planner preferences as the uncertainties are being revealed. It is expected to achieve high computational performance through the use of convex relaxations, large neighborhood search, and parallel implementations of decomposition algorithms. The proposed algorithms will be evaluated on real test cases offered by the largest transmission operator in Europe, ranging from 2,000 to 20,000 buses, as well as synthetic versions from these test cases that are adapted to the realities of the United States."

IoT systems are expected to ultimately usher significant advances in critical domains such as transportation, energy, and healthcare. Due to IoTs' pervasiveness and impact on the cyber-physical world, it is a vital requirement to guarantee their security. In particular, authentication is one of the most fundamental security services required for any viable IoT, since it is necessary to establish trust and secure the communication among parties in a network. However, despite their merits, the vast majority of existing authentication techniques may not fully meet the needs of IoTs, especially when such systems involve heterogeneous IoTs with resource-limited devices or, must meet real-time requirements for safety reasons (e.g., delay-sensitive networks). Hence, there is a critical need for developing authentication techniques, which are lightweight, fast and scalable for heterogeneous and delay-sensitive IoTs. The objective of this project is to establish an integrated program of research and education to develop practical cryptographic techniques towards the creation of secure IoTs, as well as to develop academic course materials and outreach activities for the education and broad dissemination of the proposed techniques. The successful completion of this project is expected to provide new opportunities to significantly enhance the trustworthiness of IoTs by enabling practical authentication techniques, thereby greatly contributing towards a broad adaptation of IoT.<br/><br/>The research activities in this project will be focused on the creation of a suite of lightweight and low-latency digital signatures. Expected outcomes include: (1) A new suite of highly lightweight digital signatures for resource-limited and heterogeneous IoTs. (2)  A new series of high-performance, compromise-resilient and compact digital signatures. (3) A new suite of low-latency digital signatures for delay-sensitive IoTs. (4) A comprehensive formal security analysis, optimization and hardware-acceleration of the proposed techniques. (5) A new IoT testbed that will be used for the evaluation, improvement and education of the proposed techniques. (6) An industrial secure IoT research platform and open-source cryptographic framework, in which the proposed techniques will be deployed and improved on real-life IoT systems in collaboration with research laboratories. The educational objective is to design, implement and evaluate educational modules and outreach activities to educate students at various levels (i.e., high-school, undergraduate and graduate) in the field of cyber-security for IoT. This will be achieved via newly introduced course modules that focus on hands-on experience of the proposed techniques on real-life IoT platforms, and with various cyber-security outreach activities designed to target middle-school and female high-school and undergraduate students."

Many projects seek to improve mathematics instruction, but are not able to easily track their efforts at improvement. The primary product of this project will be a system of practical measures and routines for collecting and using data that both assesses and supports the implementation of rigorous instructional materials in middle-grades mathematics. In contrast to research and accountability measures, practical measures are assessments that require little time to administer and can thus be used frequently. The data can be analyzed rapidly so that teachers can receive prompt feedback on their progress, and instructional leaders can use the data to decide where to target resources to support improvement in the quality of instruction and student learning. The system of practical measures and routines will include 1) measures of high-leverage aspects of teachers' instructional practices that have been linked to student learning (e.g., rigor of tasks, quality of students' discourse) and attend to equitable student participation; and 2) measures of high-leverage aspects of key supports for improving the quality of teachers' practice (e.g., quality of professional development; coaching); and 3) a set of routines regarding how to use the resulting data to engage in rapid, improvement efforts. A key principle of the proposed project is that the system of measures and routines can be adapted to a wide range of school and district contexts. This project is supported by the Discovery Research preK-12 (DRK-12) program. The DRK-12 program supports research and development of STEM education innovations and approaches in assessment, learning, and teaching. <br/><br/>The project will establish three research-practice partnerships with five districts, in three different states, that are currently implementing rigorous instructional materials in middle-grades mathematics. Year 1 will focus on the development of a set of practical measures of classroom instruction. Year 2 will focus on testing the use of the classroom measures in the context of supports for teachers' learning, and the development of practical measures of key supports for teachers' learning. Years 3-4 will focus on how the project can ""learn our way to scale"" (Bryk et al., 2015), which requires strategically implementing measures and routines in increasingly diverse conditions. The project will engage in rapid improvement cycles in which researchers will work alongside district leaders and professional development (PD) facilitators to analyze the data from the measures of both classroom instruction and the quality of support for teacher learning to test the effectiveness of improvements in intended supports for teacher learning and to adjust the design of the support based on data. Across Years 1-4, the project will use recent developments in technology and information visualization to test and improve 1) the collection of practical measures in situ and 2) the design of data representations (or visualizations) that support teachers and leaders to make instructional improvement decisions. In Year 5, the project will conduct formal analyses of the relations between supports for teachers' learning; teachers' knowledge and classroom practices; and student learning."

Increasing efforts have been made to integrate decentralized and alternative water and energy systems, such as rainwater collection, greywater recycling, and solar energy systems, into the existing centralized networks (i.e. electrical grid, municipal water supply system). While such integrations could potentially increase the resilience of our water and energy supplies to natural and man-made security threats, decentralized systems often lack economies of scale and hence could present increased environmental and socioeconomic costs depending on technologies and geographic locations. Without careful planning and design of such integrations and enough adoption, they could cause unintended consequences such as over-production, conflicts in resource acquisition, and an overall greater use of resources. Planning and design involves great complexities at multiple scales from individual preferences/choices to water energy systems nexus. This project applies expertise in the areas of computer science/computational sustainability, economics, infrastructure systems analysis, and life cycle assessment in a manner that develops new knowledge of these complexities in an area of critical national need. The work informs decision makers about possible outcomes and tradeoffs in different decentralized water and energy adoption scenarios. The project facilitates the planning and design of decentralized systems, and informs policy development to create more sustainable (lower environmental impacts) and resilient (able to recover from disruption) infrastructure systems for urban communities. <br/><br/>This project aims to develop understanding and knowledge of complexities behind the integration of centralized and decentralized water and energy systems under future demographic, climate, and technology scenarios in pursuit of resilience and sustainability. This research uses survey instruments to characterize individual preferences (utility functions) related to (de)centralization of water and energy infrastructure systems; a crowdsourcing platform for time-effective stakeholder engagement and response collection; a spatial agent-based model to develop spatially explicit adoption trajectories and patterns in accordance with utility functions and characteristics of the major metropolitan case study locations; a system dynamics model that considers interactions among infrastructure systems, characterizes measures of resilience and sustainability, and feeds these back to the agent based model; and a cross-scale spatial optimization model to understand and characterize the possible best-case outcomes and to inform design of policies and incentive/disincentive programs. Combined, these methods provide a robust capacity to consider the ways in which future development of energy and water resources can be more or less resilient, have fewer or greater environmental consequences, meet differential demands of human populations, and result in greater or lesser overall resource use. Boston and Atlanta are the testbeds for the modeling framework developed through this project."
