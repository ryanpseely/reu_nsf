It has both scientific and societal benefits, and integrates research and education. This 8-week summer program provides mentored research experiences to a diverse group of 10 students per year, who engage in a set of activities designed to build skills and produce research on pressing socio-political questions. A key societal benefit is the production of research that generates new insights into the peaceful conditions, behaviors, and edifices that permit societies to flourish. This objective carries positive implications for national security: key global challenges are declining physical security and growing deficiencies in institutions that deliver effective policies and protect basic freedoms. To meet these challenges, we need to equip researchers with cutting-edge capabilities and we need to produce policy-relevant scientific research. A critical contribution to education is to build students? interest and skills in the development, interpretation, and communication of rigorous social science research. An important contribution to national welfare is to prepare and support young citizens in the pursuit of careers involving the production, presentation, and consumption of rigorous social science research, especially in ways that advance strong societies and institutions. In addition, the program contributes to building a stronger research community by engaging and creating networks for scholars from minority-serving institutions, teaching institutions, and larger research institutions.<br/><br/>REU participants are guided through two complementary experiences: a mentored independent research project and collaboration on a faculty affiliate?s project. Students attend skill-building sessions on research design, scientific inference, data analysis, professionalization, research communication, faculty research presentations, and career panels. The site engages collaborating partners at minority-serving institutions universities, local colleges, and professional organizations to amplify awareness of the program and recruit a wide range of participants. The site will generate new discoveries on how accountability, behavior, and conflict shape democratic politics. Topics include contentious politics, governance failings and their consequences, political polarization, and responsiveness in government institutions. The REU site will (1) provide mentored research opportunities to a diverse group of students; (2) train faculty and student mentors; (3) equip students with research skills, networks, and other resources for career development; (4) elevate the visibility and voices of individuals from under-represented groups; (5) connect with and include faculty from minority-serving institutions and a diverse network of researchers; and (6) provide students with the tools to effectively communicate research findings to academic and non-academic audiences. The site will provide mentored research experiences on topics related to accountability, behavior, and conflict in democratic politics; build interest, skillsets, and knowledge at the cutting edge of social science research; and prepare and support students entering career paths that involve the production, presentation, and informed consumption of scientific research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The GIS holds enough freshwater to raise sea level by 7.4 meters (24 feet) if it melted completely. Thus, understanding how it responds to warming is important. This project will investigate GIS vulnerability by studying how the GIS responded to climate warming in the past. At the end of the last ice age, about 20,000 years ago, the western GIS margin extended farther into Baffin Bay, hundreds of kilometers west of its present position. By 10,000 years ago, the ice margin had largely retreated to within the current coastline. It is unclear if a warming atmosphere, a warming ocean, or some combination of the two is responsible for the retreat. Sediments studied along the West Greenland margin as part of this project will establish regional variations in the timing, magnitude, and rate of GIS retreat during the deglaciation. The relative timing of GIS changes and ocean warming, recorded in the same sediments, will improve our understanding of the behavior of large ice sheets in the past and future. The project broader impacts include support for a postdoctoral researcher, three graduate students, and undergraduate researchers. In addition, the project will support production of an outreach film based on the proposed research expedition. The project also will facilitate development of an upper-level undergraduate course focused on the deglaciation.  <br/><br/>To accomplish this goal, an oceanographic expedition will study four West Greenland trough mouth fan systems (where the GIS deposited large volumes of sediment when it extended offshore) using seafloor and sub-seafloor imaging techniques and by collecting sediment cores spanning the end of the last ice age to present. Biological, magnetic, geochemical, and physical properties from the sediment records will be used to test the primary hypothesis; that increasing ocean temperature at the base of marine terminating glaciers is a major driver of ice-sheet instability.

As of 2013, all 50 states and the District of Columbia offer online learning experiences to K?12 students, ranging from supplemental courses that accompany traditional in-person instruction to full-time online schools. Understanding the promise and limitations of remote learning is an urgent line of research now because of increased reliance on remote instruction during the COVID-19 pandemic. The pandemic and continued disruptions to schooling have been associated with substantial setbacks in learning. Studies examining academic progress between March 2020 and March 2021 reported significant lack of progress, which was particularly pronounced in math and science relative to reading. Furthermore, lack of progress was greatest among subgroups that already experience achievement disparities in math and science, such as students of color, rural students, and those eligible for free or reduced-price lunch.<br/><br/>This comprehensive systematic review and meta-analysis synthesizes evidence surrounding math and science remote education programs from the past 15 years. The goal is to understand the effectiveness of math and science remote education programs; how their effectiveness varies by program characteristics (e.g., fully online vs. hybrid, synchronous vs. asynchronous, and student-instructor ratio); and whether their effects vary with student sample characteristics. To prioritize future research needs, the researchers will create evidence gap maps to illuminate patterns in the existing evidence base and identify areas in which evidence is lacking. This analysis will build foundational knowledge and inform educators about which programs and strategies in math and science remote education have been most effective. In addition, the review will provide targeted guidance on which programs and strategies have been most appropriate for vulnerable groups of students.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research K-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools (RMTs).

Metabolic pathways such as glycolysis use phosphate to form intermediate metabolites, and the levels of the phosphate containing metabolites can provide important information implicated in human diseases such as cancer. The Nag lab will focus on developing sensors for adenosine triphosphate, a nucleoside phosphate metabolite, and for glucose-6-phosphate, a sugar phosphate metabolite, which belong to two different important classes of phosphate-containing metabolites. Underrepresented minority (URM) students will be involved in this research, through summer fellowship and directed studies with Professor Nag. Prof. Nag will also be involved in developing a community of URM students at Clark University thorough mingles, and she and her students will participate in outreach activities and develop workshops for regional high schools.<br/><br/>Professor Nag will develop a comprehensive approach for sensing phosphate-containing metabolites by targeting simultaneously both the phosphate moiety and the nucleoside or sugar component attached to the phosphate. The binding motifs will be assimilated into cyclic fluorescent peptidic or peptidomimetic libraries. The libraries will be designed such that they can be easily converted in a one-step reaction to linear analogs that can be readily sequenced using de novo sequencing. The cyclic libraries will be screened for selectively binding the phosphate-containing metabolite of interest, and the hits from the screen, once sequenced, will be studied to help understand which interactions of the sensor with a metabolite are critical for selective detection of metabolites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

State-of-the-art works all focus on prototype pollution itself but not the follow-up influence, which we call further consequences in this project. Although people understand that prototype pollution may lead to some consequences such as overwriting critical variables, it remains unclear what a list of possible consequences could be and more importantly how prevalent they are in the real world. This greatly limits people?s understanding of prototype pollution: They often do not take prototype pollution seriously because they think it is a ""theoretical"" vulnerability, which may not have a severe consequence as other web vulnerabilities.<br/><br/>In this project, an automated framework on a novel joint taint-flow analysis is designed to systematically study and measure further consequences of prototype pollution vulnerabilities in the real world. Specifically, such an analysis connects different taint-flows based on object lookup and assignment statements. The project will answer three fundamental questions in prototype pollution, i.e., (i) where to inject/alter a property, (ii) what property to pollute, and (iii) what value to inject. For example, a Cross-site Scripting (XSS) consequence depends on the answer to the question (iii) and the corresponding joint taint-flow: The taint goes into the value of a polluted property belonging to a polluted object as an en-route stop, and then finally to a traditional XSS sink like eval.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Federated learning has seen large-scale deployment in diverse societal applications because it enables many clients (e.g., smartphones, IoT devices, and edge devices) to collaboratively learn from a machine learning model. With help of a cloud server, the process allows analysis without having to share private data. While there are already many studies on improving the accuracy and communication efficiency of federated learning, its security is much less explored. In this project, the investigators will bridge the gap by exploring new security attacks to federated learning and developing new secure federated learning methods that reduce the risk that the analyses and models can be manipulated by outside actors. <br/><br/>This project has three objectives targeting the security of federated learning. First, the research team will systematically investigate the security vulnerabilities of federated learning. In particular, they will explore security vulnerabilities in the training phase of federated learning, such as poisoning attacks and backdoor attacks.

This is possible because these conditions often manifest themselves through behavioral and physiological changes (e.g., reduced activity, increased heart rate, depressed mood). Currently, such conditions exact a massive toll, with mental health conditions representing 19% of all years of life lost to disability and premature mortality and viral infections, such as COVID-19 and influenza, rising to the third leading cause of death in the US in 2020. Despite the significant potential of increasingly available data, broad and tangible impacts have yet to be realized, in part due to the unique challenges of integrating and modeling a broad range of behavioral and health data. This project seeks to address these challenges by developing and sharing computational tools that will enable researchers, clinicians and practitioners to improve mental health treatment and more rapidly respond to emerging diseases. The project will also provide an integrated research and educational program by: (1) increasing high-school students' exposure to computer science with a focus on health and well-being applications; (2) creating and disseminating materials for high-school teachers to use in their classrooms; (3) preparing undergraduate students to address health and well-being challenges through an interdisciplinary data science class; and (4) broadly disseminating the results of this work through public open-source software and workshops for researchers and practitioners. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a unified representation learning framework that addresses the unique challenges of modeling fine-grained behavioral data. Specifically, the learned compressed representations must: (1) be highly predictive in spite of the challenges of integrating heterogeneous data sources from sensors, devices, app use, demographic and health information (e.g., highly seasonal time series, discrete events, and static features), (2) effectively generalize to new users, populations, and outcomes outside the training data and source domain, (3) be robust to commonly missing data, and (4) protect private identifying information when considering how to share data or models with others. Additionally, due to recruiting and participation costs, most behavioral health applications represent small data problems, making it particularly challenging to learn effective predictive models from individual datasets alone. To address these challenges, this project will develop and integrate new methods for representation learning, self-supervision, transfer learning, robustness to missing data, and the protection of identifying information. The research team will demonstrate and evaluate the performance of the representation learning framework across a diverse set of health applications, including behavioral monitoring of influenza and COVID-19 symptoms and personalizing sleep and mental health interventions. With these advancements, the project seeks to enable rapid model customization, significantly reduce the expertise and effort required to build new behavioral health research and applications, and help scientists and health professionals answer fundamental research questions about the impact of behavioral health conditions and the design of personalized interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to serve the national interest by understanding how to teach students to create inclusive and unbiased software. The project focuses on the development of empathy-building interventions and the study of their impact on students. It is hypothesized that empathy-creating interventions will advance experiential computing education by increasing student understanding and motivation of computing topics and will result in the development of more equitable and inclusive software. This project will generate knowledge regarding the impact of empathy-creating interventions in software engineering, the most effective methods for creating empathy, and appropriate methodologies for including empathy-creating interventions in experiential computing education. The proposed work will be the first known substantial effort to develop and evaluate empathy-creating interventions in experiential computing education.<br/><br/>The specific objectives addressed by the project include: 1) understanding the benefits and impacts of empathy-creating interventions in experiential computing education, 2) recognizing appropriate methodologies to include empathy-creating interventions in experiential computing education, and 3) understand if experiential empathy-creating interventions can help to reduce bias. This work will example the effectiveness of two forms of interventions in building empathy: experience- and expression-based interventions. Experience-based interventions allow the perceiver to encounter a scenario through the target?s perspective using either a hands-on or theoretical activity. Expression-based interventions teach participants to recognize the internal states of the participant and respond appropriately. To address the defined research objectives and collect data for analysis, students will use the created interventions in a diverse range of classes including both foundational and more advanced computing courses. The interventions will also be included in non-traditional classroom environments, such online course offerings and outreach events for high school students. Outcomes for this project will contribute to the foundational understanding of experiential education from a theoretical and practical perspective, benefiting a variety of topics in computing education, including general computing, accessibility, artificial intelligence, machine learning, autonomy, and human-computer interaction.

OT is a popular mathematical framework that has found many applications in several areas such as economics, operations research, biology, signal processing, systems and control, and data science. Still, the computational complexity of using multiple marginals hinders its use in practice, and most applications of OT are limited to two marginals. The resulting framework will greatly expand the applications of OT methods with multiple marginals. The project will also include an important application, estimating the group behavior of a large population with aggregate measurements. The measurements are aggregated in the sense that the individuals in the population/group are indistinguishable from each other. Such measurement may occur due to privacy issues where the identities of the individuals are unrevealed. This study will be potentially applicable to studying the disease spreading in a large population. Finally, the interdisciplinary nature of the research bridging multiple subjects will impact and cross-fertilize science and education in these areas.<br/> <br/>This research aims to establish a unified framework for multi-marginal OT problems with graphical costs. Unlike bi-marginal OT, which has been widely used in applications, the use of multi-marginal OT has been hindered by its notorious computational complexity that typically grows exponentially as the number of marginals increases. Still, the complexity of multi-marginal OT can be alleviated by exploiting the structures of its cost function. The project will focus on an important type of cost structure that encodes the marginals as nodes in a graph. Many multi-marginal OT problems such as the Wasserstein barycenter and the incompressible Euler flow problems are associated with such graphical structures. This project will build on two seemly irrelevant subjects: optimal transport and probabilistic graphical models. The investigator will establish the overall framework of graphical OT by merging the two subjects, and systematically investigate the theoretical properties of graphical OT, particularly in the setting with continuous state variables. Another important task is to develop efficient algorithms by leveraging available algorithms in both OT and probabilistic graphical models. Finally, the investigator will apply the framework to a representative application known as inference with aggregate measurements. In this type of inference problem involving a large population of individuals, the observations are aggregated in the form of distributions, and the problem can be formulated as an entropy regularized multi-marginal OT problem whose cost tensor is associated with a hidden Markov model. The project will provide theoretical and algorithmic tools for addressing OT problems with structured costs, and greatly expand the application domains of multi-marginal OT.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fors of Cornell University is developing initiation strategies from common chemical functional groups to prepare polymers with controlled structures.  Polymers, or long chains consisting of repeating units derived from monomers, are essential and ever-present in our everyday lives.  We encounter them in industrially manufactured plastics, naturally occurring cellulose in plants, and even plant-derived materials like cotton.  Controlled polymerizations have revolutionized the way the scientific community makes polymeric materials, enabling the synthesis of well-defined macromolecules in which the size and functionality can be precisely tailored. However, controllably grafting polymers from small molecules, biomolecules, or other polymers, requires the synthesis of initiating species on those molecules.  This typically involves tedious multistep syntheses that are inefficient and often the limiting factor in the plastics that one can access. This research will utilize photocatalysis to directly initiate radical polymerizations from common functional groups. Specifically, polymerization processes that are directly grafted from either hydridic C?H bonds or carboxylic acids will be developed and studied.  The ability to graft polymers from C?H bonds will offer an opportunity to circumvent pre-functionalization, holding opportunities in polymer upcycling and surface modification.  Polymer initiation from carboxylic acids will open an avenue to controlled and direct site-selective formation of protein-polymer conjugates for potential applications in protein therapeutics. Additionally, a photocontrolled radical polymerization using a simple nitroalkane initiator will be examined.  The nitroalkane imposes unique reactivity on the polymer chain end, allowing the pairing of radical and anionic processes to make well-defined graft polymers.  Overall, the initiation strategies in this research are expected to provide new avenues for the synthesis of advanced functional polymers.  This work will offer a substantial training opportunity for students in Ithaca, New York that represents a cross-pollination between polymer chemistry and photocatalysis.  It will expand the existing educational outreach activities to include virtual laboratory tours and polymer science tutorial videos.  These approaches will distribute high-quality remote STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) educational materials to schools across the country and extend the impact of the research beyond the scientific community to the general public.<br/><br/>This research will focus on the development of initiation strategies from common functional groups in photocontrolled polymerizations.  In the first objective, photocontrolled radical polymerizations initiated selectively from hydridic C-H bonds will be developed to circumvent challenges of initiator synthesis and enable the streamlined formation of functional polymers.  Model studies will include dioxane as the hydrogen-atom source and methyl acrylate as the monomer in reversible addition-fragmentation chain-transfer (RAFT) polymerization.  In the second objective, the methodology will be extended to carboxylic acid-based initiators.  Strong emphasis will be placed on understanding the catalytic cycle including the oxidative decarboxylation and chain capping steps and the position of RAFT equilibrium.  Lastly, nitroalkane initiators will be explored as alternatives to conventionally used alkyl bromides in atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). This approach to new chain-end functionality will take advantage of reversible mesolytic cleavage of a nitroalkane to generate an alkyl radical and corresponding nitrite anions.  This work represents an important new approach to the initiation of controlled polymerizations, with the potential to directly graft polymers from a vast array of commodity, specialty, macro, and biological molecules without pre-functionalization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These formal models provide researchers with ways to measure the relative contribution of different cognitive processes (e.g., ?familiarity? versus ?episodic recollection?), ways to answer questions regarding their development across the lifespan (e.g., children vs. young adults vs. older adults), and allow for comparison across different clinical populations (e.g., Alzheimer patients). Formal models of recognition memory also enable researchers to confidently tackle socially-relevant issues, such as critically evaluating different eyewitness identification procedures used by police departments. The proposed research addresses the present problem that multiple candidate models may offer alternative characterizations of the same data (e.g., some candidate models postulate that recognition judgments are driven by a single mnemonic process whereas others postulate two or more). While unresolved, this issue stands in the way of researchers and practitioners having properly validated tools for characterizing people?s mnemonic processes in detail. A key aspect of the present work is the novelty of the methods applied: the team closely coordinates experimental designs and mathematical proofs in order to reveal ?behavioral signature patterns? predicted by the different models. The empirical results from these studies allow the team to directly test models by addressing questions regarding: 1) the relationship between mnemonic information, confidence judgments, and response bias, 2) the way mnemonic information is represented (in absolute versus relative terms), 3) how exactly mnemonic information supporting a previous encounter (?did I see X before??) relates to contextual mnemonic information (?where and how did I see X before??), and 4) how many distinct retrieval processes are necessary to adequately characterize recognition judgments (e.g., do we need to postulate separate ?episodic recollection? processes?). The overarching result is a drastic reduction in the number of viable candidate models and a convergence towards a single validated account of recognition memory that brings the formal modeling of recognition to its full potential in both research and applied settings. In turn, the educational component of this work establishes as its goals the development of much-needed coursework on the foundations of psychological science as well as an undergraduate training program on formal modeling that is explicitly targeted at increasing the graduate-level representation of members of historically underrepresented groups and US nationals more broadly. Together, the work resolves a number of open research problems and increases the number of US college students equipped to take on the scientific challenges of tomorrow using state-of-the-art formal methods.<br/><br/>Different models of recognition memory are currently being used in research and applied settings to characterize the cognitive processes behind people?s memory judgments. These models ? couched in Signal Detection or High-Threshold frameworks ? differ in terms of the nature and number of cognitive processes that they postulate. The existence of multiple candidate models creates a problem in that the same data can be interpreted in multiple, incompatible ways. The present research critically compares these different models with goal of obtaining a single validated account. This goal is achieved by articulating experimental designs collecting forced-choice and ranking judgments along with formal results that speak to all candidate models (e.g., Block-Marschak and Tversky-Sattath inequalities) in order to obtain privileged testing grounds that require minimal auxiliary assumptions. In practice, this means that it is possible to set aside the generic model-comparison methods (model fit + complexity penalty) traditionally used by researchers up to this point and re-focus efforts on specific model predictions that can be directly tested at the level of the data using order-constrained inferential methods. The test results produced here are able to address a number of key questions, such as: 1) are confidence ratings direct, noiseless mappings of latent strengths? 2) are latent-strength values represented in terms of likelihood ratios? 3) are ?episodic recollection? processes necessary (in addition to latent strengths) to adequately describe the retrieval of contextual information or the discrimination of studied items from highly similar foils? These answers can drastically reduce the set of candidate models of recognition memory, and will lead to the development of strongly-validated cognitive psychometric tools for experimental procedures, such as the Memory Similarity Task, which is widely used in developmental and neurocognitive research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More complicated topological objects can be constructed by fitting these spheres together. Spheres of different dimensions can fit together in only a few different ways. Enumerating these combinations of spheres is one of the fundamental questions of a branch of mathematics called homotopy theory. This project focuses on the computation of the stable homotopy groups of spheres, using three general categories of techniques: theory, manual computation, and machine computation. These categories are mutually reinforcing. Theory establishes new techniques of computation; manual computation reveals new structure that points toward theoretical advances; machine computation provides independent verification of manual computation and carries it even further. Broader impacts of the project include development and growth of the electronic Computational Homotopy Theory (eCHT) virtual research community. With a long-term goal of self-sustainability, the eCHT community will experiment with different types of online engagement, such as foundational courses for early-career graduate students, seminar series on focused topics, career development events, online conferences, and building connections to online networks in neighboring subjects. These new modes of interaction aim to overcome traditional barriers to entry, especially for people in remote geographical locations and for those with non-traditional backgrounds. <br/><br/>The project's main research goal is to compute stable homotopy groups of spheres in the classical, C-motivic, R-motivic, and C2-equivariant contexts. It breaks into three main topics: the Adams spectral sequence, the effective slice spectral sequence, and deformations of stable homotopy theory. The effective spectral sequence is a replacement for the Adams-Novikov spectral sequence in the R-motivic and C2-equivariant situations. The first two topics are essentially computational, although they point towards a number of more theoretical questions. Two of the many possible outcomes of these computations are: new information about Mahowald (root) invariants; and settling the last unknown case of the Kervaire invariant one problem. The third topic is a theoretical perspective that was recently uncovered by computational exploration.

In seeking to make an optimal decision for each individual (i.e., personalized decision making), we need to understand the causal relationship between a decision and its consequent outcome. Causal inference provides a principled way to achieve personalized decision making by learning individual-level causal effects from observational data. Its impacts are seen in a broad spectrum of application domains. However, existing causal inference frameworks are mostly data-driven and face multifaceted challenges (at the assumption-, data-, and application-level) when applied in real-world observational studies. Despite that, a vast amount of prior human knowledge manifests itself in different ways and could be leveraged to tackle these challenges.  Although abundant human knowledge provides great opportunities, its complex nature coupled with observational data also imposes tremendous hurdles. This project aims to bridge the gap between what can be accessed (i.e., a large amount of observational data across different domains and human knowledge in different formats) and what is desired (i.e., more effective causal inference to advance personalized decision making).<br/><br/><br/>This project develops a suite of novel causal inference models and algorithms to analyze observational data by harnessing the power of human knowledge and gaining deeper insights to advance personalized decision making. First, it leverages relational knowledge that describes the relations among data instances in observational data, investigates its role in relaxing overly optimistic assumptions for causal inference. Second, it explores meta knowledge that depicts distinct properties of observational data and develops principled causal inference models and algorithms to incorporate such knowledge. Third, it aims to improve the utility of existing data-driven causal inference frameworks by harnessing application knowledge, which characterizes the unique needs of real-world applications. The outcomes of this project will enable researchers and practitioners to assimilate massive amounts of observational data, across numerous application domains, and leverage abundant human knowledge, to benefit scientific discovery and informed decision making. Outcomes of this project will be integrated into the existing curricula and new courses. This project will also provide research opportunities to undergraduate and graduate students, especially female and underrepresented minorities. Customized research and teaching components will be designed and implemented to attract K-12 students in STEM education and engage them in causal inference and data science research.

The host institution for the fellowship is the University of Maryland, College Park, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Wolfgang Losert. <br/><br/>Asteroid surfaces are incredibly complex and diverse environments with large boulders several meters in size alongside fine-grained regolith. The polydisperse nature of the surface extends to the subsurface where little is known about the composition, porosity, or size distribution of the granular material. These environments are subject to surface impacts from micrometeorites or material ejected from the surface into suborbital trajectories. Asteroids also experience thermal compression and relaxation due to their fast rotation speeds. Both of these processes contribute to compressive cycling forces that can be imprinted in the grain's memory. This project aims to study the dynamics of oblique impacts as a means to probe this stored information in the grains. Impact experiments into granular systems provide a way to study subsurface granular systems from surface interactions alone. This is a major advantage in the context of space missions, especially those equipped with landers, or with specially designed impactors for testing the surface response or for determining landing sites. This project involves multidisciplinary fields (such as computational physics and engineering) and includes students of diverse academic backgrounds.

They plan to demonstrate that this light emission can be modulated by viscosity and temperature and they will study the compound design features that best enable this modulation.  With the ability to correlate the intensity of the emitted light with the temperature and the viscosity, the group will be able to measure the temperature and viscosity inside of the cells. These properties vary with the type of cell and are important properties to help in the diagnosis of disease and in the unraveling of cell metabolism.  The research is also of interest in the management of industrial processes, such as monitoring completion of polymerization and hydrogelation processes.

As part of the commitment to support the advancement and inclusivity of underrepresented minority faculty, Professor Ana de Bettencourt-Dias will continue mentoring junior colleagues and promoting their science through a variety of avenues, including, but not limited to, the Periodic TableTalks. <br/><br/>Lanthanide ions display sharp emission profile. This emission, which arises from transitions within the 4f orbitals, is most efficiently sensitized through coordinated ligand chromophores. These chromophores can be designed to display an energy transfer to the emissive lanthanide ion, which is modulated by viscosity and temperature. In this project, Professor Ana de Bettencourt-Dias and her research group propose to isolate several new ligands, based on N-heterocycles and cyanovinyl molecular rotors, and to assess their ability to promote metal-ion centered emission as a function of the temperature and viscosity of the medium.

Transport barriers organize flows into distinct regions with large scale coherent structures, and, thus, control the mixing of passive particles and substances. For example, transport barriers can be exploited to predict oil spill patterns. However, less is known about how these transport barriers affect the transport and mixing of active matter and vice-versa. Despite evidence that aquatic organisms, such as fish schools and phytoplankton, could affect transport in the ocean, a systematic understanding of the interplay between activity and transport barriers is lacking. Such understanding is crucial for controlling active matter in unsteady flows, with the potential to impact application areas ranging from aquatic ecology to bio-inspired designs. This award will support research to advance our knowledge of the interplay between active matter and transport barriers.<br/><br/>In order to reveal the two-way coupling between transport barriers and active matter, the PI will conduct experiments in electromagnetically driven laboratory flows with light-guided brine shrimp (Artemia salina). The research plan is structured around two aims: (1) to determine the non-dimensional groups that are most relevant in the coupling of active matter and large scale transport barriers, and divide the corresponding high dimensional space spanned by the non-dimensional groups; (2) to understand how small length scale in active matter percolate through scales to modify the large length scale transport barriers. The results of this research will pave the way for implementable control strategies of active matter in real-world scenarios.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Algebraic geometry is the study of algebraic varieties, which are solution sets for systems of polynomial equations. For example, in the xy-plane, the solutions for y=0 consist of all points along the x-axis, while the solutions for xy=0 consist of all points along both coordinate axes. Since the tangent line at the origin (0,0) is not defined for the algebraic variety defined by xy=0, we say that this variety has a singularity at the origin (0,0). The first goal of the present project is to further develop the theory of singularities of algebraic varieties and more general objects. The second goal is to build the tools and techniques necessary for this research program, which would have applications to other fundamental open questions in algebraic geometry and commutative algebra.<br/><br/>The research will investigate singularities of algebraic varieties over arbitrary fields, or more generally of arbitrary Noetherian rings and schemes. Even when the primary interest is in non-singular complex algebraic varieties, working in this much more general context is often unavoidable. A major focus in the present project is to build the foundations necessary for birational geometry and the minimal model program for schemes of arbitrary characteristic. In previous work, the PI proved that Kodaira-type vanishing theorems hold for schemes in equal characteristic zero of arbitrary dimension and developed new methods to replace Kodaira-type vanishing theorems in positive characteristic. In the present project, the PI will apply the techniques from this previous work to study the behavior of singularities under flat morphisms. The PI will also investigate inversion of adjunction-type results for various classes of singularities. Finally, the PI plans to extend techniques in positive characteristic to study positivity of line bundles on algebraic varieties over arbitrary fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Machine learning is a useful technique that can make decisions on large-scale graph datasets to help prevent cyberattacks, reduce energy waste, invent new cures for diseases. Unfortunately, complicated graph structures reduce the accountability of machine decisions, which can be 1) hard for human users to comprehend, and 2) discriminative against certain subpopulations or individuals. The project will incorporate prior human knowledge about graphs as transparency and fairness constraints over machine decisions. With diverse desiderata, the project will comprehensively discover useful trade-offs of multiple competitive transparency and fairness objectives to help humans make sense of and adopt machine decisions. Due to graph variations, volatility in machine decisions can jeopardize their accountability, and the project will discover the conditions of variations under which robust transparency and fairness can and should be expected. Governments, regulators, and organizations can rely on the invented techniques to audit civil infrastructure operations, online social networks, and commerce. Scientists working on materials, drugs, and human brain networks will benefit from the accountability through the constraints designed by them. Via publications, tutorials, courses, and workshops, the project will train undergraduates and graduates, many of whom are underrepresented. K6-12 students will be educated about machine learning on graphs, using an interactive role-playing computer game, and lectures designed for the lay users, through outreach activities.<br/><br/>To meet these goals, this project identifies new challenges in accountable ML and addresses them under the BLO (bilevel optimization) framework. Unlike accountability without domain-specific constraints, the project will design human-in-the-loop constraint generation methods to help specify relevant constraints for graph data. Constraints can be numerous and uncertain, and accordingly, the project invents differentiation-through-optimization, hierarchical proximal methods, and chance-constrained optimization. Unlike scalar optimization of accountable ML, the project aims at efficient multi-objective trade-offs and proposes constrained vector optimization and continuous exploration of local Pareto fronts under the BLO framework. The project will investigate stable learning-to-precondition to exploit the smoothness of the BLO updates to speed up the optimization. To quantify the robustness of the decision accountability, the framework searches the usually undefined boundary between robustness and sensitivity of accountable models. The project proposes a trust-region search with complementary reinforcement learning policies to surgically and differentially balance robustness and sensitivity. The BLO framework provides provenance and meta-explanations for the optimal explanations and fair models. The project will also address the computational efficiency of BLO on large graphs through graph partition, first-order approximation, and advanced linear algebra techniques. Lastly, the project will analyze the convergence, uniqueness, and trade-offs in the BLO problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diamond has many properties that make it valuable well beyond its use as a gemstone. Notably, diamond hosts a sensitive detector of magnetic and electric fields: the nitrogen vacancy (NV) center. Such NV centers can be used to sense magnetic objects and have potential for use as quantum bits (qubits) in the quantum computers of the future. Diamond?s chemical inertness, its reluctance to change or be modified, is both a challenge and an opportunity for materials chemists, physicists and engineers. Changing chemical bonds on the surface of diamond allows for the attachment of molecular groups and anchoring points for measurement and detection. In this LEAPS-MPS project, the PI and his team will explore the surface chemistry of diamond and investigate how the light given off by the NV center changes with an applied voltage. The surface chemistry of nanoscale diamonds and the behavior of the NV center will be simultaneously examined with the long-term aim of making a more advanced quantum sensor. Undergraduate students will learn advanced chemistry and spectroscopy techniques, including use of the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource. Recruitment of talent is in collaboration with the Black Leadership and Opportunity Center (BLOC) and other student-based organizations at San Jose State University. This project will provide rigorous and wide-ranging research experiences to prepare scientists and engineers for a successful career by providing the skills to execute a research project, manage troubleshooting, prepare an impactful research presentation and build their resume for future success.<br/><br/>Technical Description. In this LEAPS-MPS project, the PI will explore new routes to chemically activate the surface of nanoscale high-pressure high-temperature nanoscale diamonds 25 to 100 nm in size to generate new covalent bonds and examine the photophysics of NV centers. By tuning the surface dipole moment of the diamond host, researchers will investigate a largely unexplored space of NV voltage sensing with spectroelectrochemistry. Activation of the diamond surface will occur with wet chemistry under inert conditions and a series of nucleophiles are reacted with the ?activated? diamond constructs. Confirmation of the atomic and molecular structure of the diamond constructs will occur with overlapping surface sensitive techniques including X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and synchrotron-based X-ray spectroscopies at the Stanford Synchrotron Radiation Lightsource. The surface modified samples are deposited onto transparent conducting electrodes and NV center fluorescence is tracked as a function of applied voltage in a custom microscope. A series of voltage sweep parameters are modified to understand how the NV center can toggle between its fluorescent charge states. A working model is then generated to explain the NV center fluorescent properties as a function of surface dipole moment, charge density and charge identity.  This diamond project is conducted by a highly diverse cohort of researchers from many disciplines including the physical sciences, life sciences and engineering disciplines. Researchers acquire an advanced skill set during the project cycle and will be able to successfully apply to PhD programs, work at national laboratories or enter into industrial positions upon graduation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One aspect of this uncertainty concerns how the solid Earth responds to melting ice in the form of post-glacial rebound, that is, uplift of crust after the weight of the ice has been removed.  This project will examine the behavior of the Earth beneath the ice sheet that covered northwest Scotland during the Last Glacial Maximum, 20,000 years ago.  As the earth warmed following the Last Glacial Maximum the ice sheet shrank and around 17,000 years ago a portion of the ice sheet over northwest Scotland experienced a ?collapse? or period of fast retreat.  The research will use records of past sea levels to document the behavior of the Earth beneath the front of this retreating ice sheet to determine if it rebounded (uplifted) fast enough to help stabilize the retreating ice sheet. There will also be numerical experiments to recreate the behavior of the Earth and ice sheet during this time period and compare these model experiments with measured records of past sea level changes across Scotland.  These comparisons will permit new insights into the behavior of retreating ice sheets and provide better constraints on the history and size of the ice sheet that once covered northwest Scotland.  The project will conduct a three-week in-residence summer camp for students from high schools with large minority populations to introduce them to the varied dimensions of Earth Science. <br/> <br/>The purpose of this research is to investigate the importance of sea-level feedbacks in stabilizing marine-based ice sheets during their retreat.  The proposed investigation will combine new late Pleistocene/Holocene relative sea-level constraints to be collected from raised shorelines, existing offshore marine cores, and isolation basins from across northwestern Scotland, to refine the glacial isostatic adjustment models for the British Isles.  The proposal will also investigate sea-level feedbacks at a more local level and at the scale of the Late Pleistocene ice stream that once flowed through the Minch of northwestern Scotland using a more specialized ice-sheet model.  This model, coupled with results from an improved ?global? scale glacial isostatic adjustment model for the British Isles, will be used to understand the sensitivity of the former Minch ice stream to more local variables (e.g. mantle rheology, lithospheric thickness, ice sheet geometry, etc.). Three hypotheses will be tested: 1.) Sea-level feedback did not provide a stabilizing influence for the Minch Ice Stream during its retreat following the Last Glacial Maximum; 2.) along indented ice-sheet margins, sea-level feedbacks are governed not by the local ice front but by regional isostatic adjustment; and 3.) the influence of sea-level feedback in stabilizing marine ice streams is a function of the rheology of the Earth beneath it.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, funded by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and housed in the Chemistry Division, Professor Wenyang Gao and his students at New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology will take advantage of the high reactivities of chemicals known as radicals (i.e. molecules that have odd numbers of electrons) and apply them to promote reactions of light hydrocarbons. Advances in hydraulic fracturing technologies provide vast available reserves of domestic light hydrocarbons, e.g., natural gas. Insufficient processing infrastructure coupled with the challenge of long-range transportation of gaseous hydrocarbons has prevented efficient utilization of these resources. A significant amount of natural gas has to be burned in on-site flares to avoid its direct atmospheric release. Chemical upgrading of light hydrocarbons, for instance, transforming gaseous methane into liquid methanol, is expected to turn these resources into chemical fuels or industrial feedstocks that have increased ease of handling, transport, and storage. Prof. Gao?s work will address the lack of chemical approaches for transforming methane efficiently and selectively by trapping highly reactive metal-containing radicals in rigid porous materials known as metal-organic frameworks, which will facilitate the desired reactions of light hydrocarbons.

This project expects to provide synthetic access to solid-state radicals, examine their structures and reactivities, and obtain understanding on how tamed radicals to impact the chemical valorization of light hydrocarbons.  This project will not only develop novel synthetic chemistry to access lattice-confined metalloradicals in the solid state, but also examine these highly reactive metalloradicals towards activating strong C(sp3)?H bonds in simple hydrocarbons.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mathematical modeling of such systems involves nonlinear partial differential equations and stochastic processes, which for real-world applications contain a multitude of temporal and spatial scales, making the numerical simulation of the microscopic details of their behavior beyond reach even of modern computers. To mitigate this issue, one approach is to use approximate macroscopic effective models. Another is to consider simplified models that inherit the qualitative properties of the dynamics of the larger system. The overarching goal of this project is to study the validity of such approximations in applications of interest to physical sciences and macroeconomics, among others. The mentoring and training of graduate students will be integrated in the project.<br/><br/>The first part of the project aims to develop new tools and better understanding of the connection between branching processes and nonlinear parabolic equations. One focus is on the study of branching Brownian motion in dimensions higher than one. The second part concerns the long-time behavior of nonlinear equations arising in the fluid dynamics and reaction-diffusion modeling, with a focus on very long-time scales, when fluctuations in the solutions start building up in ways beyond the classical central limit theorem time scales.

The REU program has both scientific and societal benefits integrating research and education. This renewal project will allow for further training of undergraduate students from underrepresented groups in the social sciences. Each summer, ten students will receive training in research methods related to issues facing the border region, particularly in the El Paso/ Las Cruces areas of New Mexico. With immigration and border issues remaining central to national policy debates, more on the ground research is needed to truly understand the nature of enforcement measures and their impacts on border communities in a highly dynamic and complex region. Students will learn techniques for collecting and analyzing qualitative and quantitative data as they collaborate with local organizations engaged with immigration and border enforcement debates. The goal is to produce research that is highly relevant to local needs, rather than academic research based purely on theoretical concerns. Students will explore topics related to the root causes of migration from Mexico and Central America, the impacts of border enforcement at ports of entry and interior checkpoints, as well as the relationships between federal immigration enforcement and border communities. This project will help to produce the next generation of applied social scientists for the academy, government, and the nonprofit sector, while also contributing to the scholarship on immigration policy.<br/><br/>The project seeks to address gaps in existing literature concerning the root causes of migration as well as the local impacts of federal immigration and border security policies, while preparing undergraduate students, especially those who are from groups that are underrepresented in the social sciences, to pursue academic STEM studies and careers using Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR). The program has three main goals: 1) Provide students with opportunities to conduct quality CBPR by involving them in interdisciplinary research projects on immigration policy; 2) integrate scholarship in migration and border studies; and, 3) prepare students to conduct collaborative research and present findings in a variety of academic and community venues.

The advent of Targeted Drug Delivery has led to significant progress in nano-medicine and patients' care. In this clinical process, a carrier transports and releases drugs at a specific site, thus minimizing negative side effects on healthy cells and tissues. To optimize delivery, the carrier is often directed using various methods, including technologies that mimic the propulsion of microorganisms. This interdisciplinary project will lay the foundations for an integrated Targeted Drug Delivery framework. It combines biology, computational sciences, mathematics, and physics to develop strategies and conditions for optimizing the carrier's path and release. The research results will provide insights into the ways carriers can be controlled to safely administer drugs. The project will also support and help to train students in all STEM fields. The PI will use problems from this research to develop project-based courses that provide Towson University students with hands-on experience in research. Underrepresented students will actively be recruited and encouraged to take leading roles in the project. These students will benefit from year-round exposure to advanced mathematical methods and interactions with other researchers, helping them to grow more confident in their science identity. As a result, this project will directly contribute to increasing the representation of underrepresented students in graduate schools and other STEM careers. The project will also impact Towson University by providing more opportunities in applied research for motivated students. These opportunities will further raise Towson University's profile in the Baltimore region and turn it into an attractive destination for cutting-edge transformative research in the mathematical and physical sciences.<br/><br/>The project fits into a complex, multipart, and multiscale dynamic system that will capture the fundamentals of Targeted Drug Delivery. The goal is to develop a new mathematical/computational framework for the swimming of microorganisms enclosed in a soft particle in dc electric field using partial differential equations, fluid dynamics, and numerical methods including neural networks. As a first step, an idealized representation of a propelling ciliated microorganism enclosed in a surfactant-covered drop in a dc electric field will be used to describe the directed motion of a drug carrier in an electrified medium. Analytical and numerical tools will help to probe and solve the partial differential equations that govern the problem, including spheroidal harmonics, asymptotic analyses, and machine learning. Specifically, for conditions beyond the analytical models' range of validity, solutions will be approximated numerically using physics-informed neural networks. The models and techniques developed herein have intrinsic mathematical merit, arising from contemporary interdisciplinary applications such as microrobots propulsion and microfluidics. They also embody a broad scope of research activities including swimming dynamics of biological organisms and electrohydrodynamics of soft particles. Once completed, this project will also result in a unified and efficient convergent theory for hyperparameters of physics-informed neural networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Past joint work of the PI reimagined the foundations of infinite-dimensional category theory with the aim of simplifying proofs by replacing ""analytic"" methods, that rely on the combinatorics of a particular model of infinite-dimensional categories, with ""synthetic"" ones that apply in any model. One part of this project seeks to develop a computer-verifiable formal language that expresses only statements about infinite-dimensional categories that are invariant under change of model. Such a language would force users to ""speak no evil"" by guaranteeing that every statement they express is model-independent. This project connects to the plans to recast the theory of infinite-dimensional categories in a new proposed univalent foundation system for mathematics, in which homotopical uniqueness up to a contractible space of choices becomes genuine uniqueness, permitting streamlined definitions of fundamental concepts. Both of these projects will be undertaken in part with mentees of the PI at Johns Hopkins. In parallel, the PI has concrete plans to continue her expository and outreach work which include a new book (Elements of Infinity-Category Theory, joint with Verity), lectures directed at the general public, survey articles prepared for a variety of audiences, and efforts to improve access to advanced mathematics, such as her service on the Equity, Diversity, and Inclusion Advisory Board at the Banff International Research Station.<br/><br/>The pioneers of homotopy type theory - the new proposed univalent foundation system - envisioned a computer-verifiable foundation for infinite-dimensional category theory, but some computational content is lost through the classical reasoning used in classical homotopy theory. With collaborators, the PI will develop a new model for classical homotopy theory in a particular category of cubical sets, in which cubical fibrations are required to be equivariant, respecting the symmetries of cubes defined by permuting their dimensions. A longer-term aim is to use similar methods to obtain cubical set based presentations of all infinity-topoi. A computer proof assistant based on equivariant cubical fibrations would have the correct classical semantics but would be able to restore the computational content to univalent mathematics. A final project explores homotopical macrocosms for higher category theory, aiming to prove that the collection of cartesian fibrations between (infinity,n)-categories assemble into a cartesian fibration of (infinity,n+1)-categories, which can be regarded as some sort of categorified hyperdoctrine for (infinity,n)-category theory. Results of this nature would establish a global lifting property against homotopy coherent diagrams that should aid further developments in (infinity,n)-category theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Engineering students participate at lower rates, and racially and economically minoritized college/university students are the least likely to have the opportunity to participate. In addition, such international trips rarely take place in sub-Saharan Africa. To address this need, this IRES Track 1 project supports U.S. underrepresented students in conducting research in community-engaged engineering and the design of localized engineering education in Eldoret, Kenya. Students will work with research mentors in social work, engineering, and from the community itself, which will support their critical understanding of collaboration in international development and engineering problem-solving. We work across two collaborating institutions, Purdue University (PU) and San Francisco State University (SFSU), and we engage two departments at Moi University in Kenya, Education/Social Work and Engineering, and a community partner organization, Tumaini Innovation Center. This project will allow a broader population of U.S. engineering students to participate in an international research experience. This program gives first-generation, racially-minoritized, or low socioeconomic-status students the opportunity to carry out research abroad and experience the research process while also empowering them through mentorship and reflection. The student research projects will expand existing research in both Kenya and the U.S. in community-engaged engineering and localized engineering education.<br/><br/>This project addresses an integrated set of research and practice aims, both through the research that student IRES participants will conduct and in the thoughtful evaluation of the program. First, the research conducted by the student researchers will contribute to rich scholarship in both community-engaged engineering and the development of localized engineering teaching and learning. There is a great need for additional research on how engineers can engage with communities in just and sustainable ways and for how engineering education can meet the unique needs of individual communities and student populations. The IRES student research projects have the potential to identify opportunities and approaches for developing engineering education that builds effectively on local knowledge. Second, the evaluation of this program can contribute to our understanding of student learning, intercultural growth, and experiences in international research. In particular, our project will focus on racially and economically marginalized and first-generation students, who are typically not represented in existing research on such programs. Through our engagement with multiple U.S. institutions (Purdue and SFSU) and our focused engagement with groups that support underrepresented students in engineering at both institutions, our IRES program will provide a mechanism for broad impacts on the fields of engineering education and engineering practice. Through our detailed student recruitment plan and our thematic focus, our IRES program will broaden access to impactful, community-centered engineering education research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, the operation of buildings accounts for 40% of the energy consumption in the United States with buildings producing ~39% of process-related CO2 emissions globally. At the same time and in recent decades, materials research has advanced significantly through groundbreaking work on bioinspired materials that are smart, adaptive and responsive. The iPRISM program will leverage these advances by implementing new material technologies that enable buildings to sense, adapt and respond to functional and environmental conditions. In the process, these new technologies will improve the construction, performance, and maintenance of buildings, resulting in lower CO2 emissions and lower energy consumption. In addition, iPRISM will build on the strong partnership between the Penn State Center for Living Multifunctional Materials Systems and North Carolina A&T in the United States and the University of Freiburg livMatS Center of Excellence in Germany to increase participation of U.S. students from traditionally underrepresented groups in material science and research abroad. The iPRISM students will be guided in their research by world-renowned experts and will have access to unique facilities, including full-scale built structures that incorporate novel and nature-inspired composites. The iPRISM focuses on the development of novel synthetic ?living? materials critical to improving the construction, performance, and maintenance of buildings to increase their adaptiveness. Student research projects focus on key knowledge gaps in the design, manufacturing and characterization of living materials closely integrated with needs in sustainable, resilient and adaptive building design. In the construction stage, building materials will respond to light-triggers to adapt to the additive manufacturing process, and nature-inspired load-adapted composites will enable sustainable and green building materials. During the performance stage, responsive materials will facilitate smart building skins interacting autonomously with their physical environment and new self-powered materials will lower the energy needs of buildings. Finally, in the maintenance stage, multifunctional materials will advance sensor networks to monitor building operations. Our technical approach rests on strategies inherent to the development of engineered synthetic living materials and well-suited to emergent approaches and needs in realizing adaptive architecture, considering autonomous adaptation, robustness, resilience, energy harvesting, and sustainability.<br/><br/>This U.S.-German partnership builds on multidisciplinary research at the intersection of biology, material science and engineering, strengthens international research collaborations, and contributes to enhancing the competitiveness of the U.S. workforce in the global economy. The iPRISM research will achieve innovations in smart buildings with promise to improve the manufacture and maintenance of other large infrastructures.  Our educational impacts include student mentoring, with a key goal of broadening student participation in materials science and STEM fields by leveraging programs at Penn State and a long-lasting partnership at NC A&T. These goals will strengthen the pipeline for the advancement and scientific leadership of students from underrepresented groups. Students will participate in scientific, social and cultural activities that will develop their professional skills and network, an impact that extending beyond the proposed program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A central aspect of these fields is the study of polynomials in many variables - or multivariate polynomials.  Multivariate polynomials appear in a wide range of applications such as mechanical engineering, robotics, computer-aided design, and numerical partial differential equations.  The research will be clustered in three interconnected areas where multivariate polynomials play an essential role.  The first is configurations of linear subspaces, such as lines in the plane.  The second is interpolation, which involves fitting data with a polynomial model.  The third is piecewise polynomial functions, or splines, such as the Bezier splines common in drawing programs.  Each of these fields have major unsolved conjectures revolving around the impact of combinatorics and geometry on corresponding algebraic objects.  A recurring theme of the project is to use rigidity theory, which has its origins in structural engineering, to elucidate this impact.  Several lines of inquiry are a collaborative effort among the disparate communities of numerical analysis, rigidity theory, commutative algebra, and algebraic geometry. The project includes training opportunities for graduate students.  This project is jointly funded by the Algebra and Number Theory program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>The project focuses on problems where the interactions between geometry, combinatorics, and algebra are not well-understood.  A first goal is to use rigidity theory to systematically produce line arrangements with fixed combinatorics whose module of derivations has changing structure based on the geometry, generalizing an example of Ziegler.  Understanding these examples sheds additional light on Terao's conjecture, which proposes that freeness of an arrangement is combinatorial. A second goal involves searching for a counterexample to a conjecture in numerical analysis using a hybrid of symbolic and numerical methods based on techniques analogous to rigidity theory.  This conjecture, which is long-standing, proposes a formula for the dimension of the space of smooth cubic splines on triangulations.  A third goal is to study asymptotic containments between symbolic and regular powers of ideals, with an eye toward highly structured examples where recent connections to combinatorial optimization and linear programming give good prospects for progress.  Despite their differences, the three focus areas allow for a rich exchange of techniques.  For example, homological methods connect hyperplane arrangements and splines to rigidity, while Macaulay inverse systems link splines to symbolic powers.  The projects are computational in nature and will include the development of code in symbolic software (Macaulay2) and numerical software (Bertini).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While topology, geometry, and analysis are united in the two-dimensional plane, higher dimensional Euclidean spaces or abstract metric spaces lack such powerful tools. Such considerations prompted the development of the field of ""analysis on metric spaces,"" in which first-order differential calculus and geometric measure theory are extended from the classical Euclidean or Riemannian setting to the realm of spaces without a priori smooth structure (such as fractals). Results and techniques in this field have found important applications in geometric group theory, in the structure of manifolds, and in analysis on fractals. Furthermore, besides their mathematical importance, physical applications of these theories range from the reconstruction of missing data in large data sets, to methodologies for data storage and access, and to the study of thin films.<br/><br/>This project seeks to develop techniques to address several long-standing questions in the field of analysis on metric spaces and geometric measure theory. The first goal is to relate integral bounds for discrete forms of curvature on non-smooth manifolds with locally Euclidean bi-Lipschitz parameterizations. Such parameterizations are well understood in two dimensions but have so far been elusive in dimensions greater or equal to three. Another goal is to identify sufficient conditions for 2-rectifiability, that is, to understand which sets are contained within the Lipschitz image of a square. Results in this direction will in turn lead to an improved understanding of 2-rectifiable measures. Finally, the project addresses the Euclidean embedding question, namely, to characterize those metric spaces that admit an embedding into a finite-dimensional Euclidean space that does not distort the geometry of the space too much. Apart from providing a better understanding of the geometry and analysis of metric spaces, the existence of such embeddings has been instrumental in recent advances in theoretical computer science and graphic imaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Page and Sean T. Roberts of The University of Texas at Austin are studying how the chemical structure of visible and near-infrared light absorbing dye molecules influences their ability to catalyze the additive manufacturing of plastics in an energy-efficient manner. Traditional light-based manufacturing relies on the use of dyes that operate only with high-energy ultraviolet (UV) light. This reliance on UV light is both energy-intensive and limits the functionality of materials that can be produced due to the low penetration depth of UV light and its potential to induce photodamage. The funded research teams aim to overcome this limitation by synthesizing new dye molecules comprised of earth-abundant elements and examining the ability of these so-called 'photocatalysts' to efficiently harvest the energy contained in visible/near-infrared (IR) light to power chemical reactions. These fundamental efforts are anticipated to increase the accessibility of light-based manufacturing at an affordable price, which has direct implications in technologies such as coatings, microelectronics, and 3D printing. The broader impacts of the project will extend to providing new training opportunities for both undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary chemistry with activities ranging from chemical synthesis to laser-based spectroscopic characterization. Moreover,  Page and Roberts will bridge educational programs at UT Austin and Austin Community College to create a channel for students to share knowledge and interact via hands-on research opportunities in an effort to improve diversity in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics).<br/><br/>Under this award, the  UT-Austin collaborative team of Page and Roberts has as its overarching goal the development of eco-conscious photocatalysts that can harvest low-energy, visible-to-near infrared light with efficiency and selectivity that extend beyond our current capabilities with UV light, the industrial gold standard. To this end, three aims will be addressed. The first involves the establishment of a quantitative correlation between the structure of heavy-atom free photocatalysts (e.g., those without toxic halogens or expensive metals) and their ability to induce polymerization via long-lived spin-triplet states. The second aim is to identify individual dyes capable of absorbing multiple different colors of light and using that distinct, dual-band absorptive property to drive orthogonal chemical transformations (i.e., wavelength-selective catalysis). The third aim seeks to drive rapid photopolymerizations in UV-opaque materials by converting more transparent low energy visible/near-infrared photons into high-energy ones via triplet fusion-based photon upconversion. Each aim combines the synthesis of novel dye molecules with ultrafast spectroscopic characterization to create a closed-loop of knowledge with the aim of accelerating photocatalyst optimization. If successful, this work could have significant scientific broader impacts as there is great interest in establishing more efficient methods of harvesting energy from near IR to visible light to drive chemical reactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The complex numbers are a system of generalized numbers providing greater flexibility with algebraic operations, such as allowing for the extraction of square roots of negative quantities. In this project, the investigator will apply the tools of calculus to smoothly varying complex outputs which depend on one or more complex inputs. Such objects are known in the mathematical literature as holomorphic functions. The study of holomorphic functions has applications to phenomena as diverse as the flow of liquids, heat conduction, the distribution of prime numbers, and the speed of computer programs. The project will employ two methods to construct holomorphic functions. The first is via a system of equations called the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations. The second, the method of projections, interprets the collection of holomorphic functions geometrically as a sub-collection inside a larger collection of functions, and uses this geometric insight to construct holomorphic functions with specified properties. The deeper understanding of holomorphic functions to be gained in this project will be useful for applications both within and outside mathematics. The project will also involve undergraduate participants, who will work on both the computational and theoretical aspects of the problems. Such participation will expose students to challenging mathematical problems and will contribute to the training of future mathematicians and scientists.<br/><br/>Holomorphic functions of one or several complex variables constitute a natural and important class of functions in analysis and have important applications throughout science and engineering. This project investigates two classical techniques for constructing such functions: the inhomogeneous Cauchy-Riemann equations and projection operators. For the Cauchy-Riemann equations, the main thrust is to study the solution of these equations in annuli, where an annulus in complex Euclidean space is a domain obtained from a larger domain (the envelope) by removing a compact subset (the hole).  Since annuli are not domains of holomorphy, new phenomena appear in this situation which are not found in the well-understood and classical setting of pseudoconvex domains. The analogy between complex analysis on annuli and Alexander duality (a circle of ideas in topology) is expected to forge novel methods of attack on these questions. Coupled with classical approaches based on a priori estimates for partial differential operators, these new methods will be employed to yield important new information on function theory of new classes of non-pseudoconvex domains. With regards to the geometric construction via projection operators, a primary focus of investigation will be a class of questions concerning the regularity of the Bergman projection, and other associated projection operators, in Lebesgue spaces on non-smooth domains. Such regularity depends on the geometry of the domain in ways that are not completely understood. Among the domains to be studied are quotients of balls by finite groups, and Reinhardt domains whose boundary contains the origin.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Watkins of the University of Mississippi is developing polymeric systems that can encapsulate biocompatible organic fluorophores for fluorescence imaging.  Fluorophores are dyes that contain special carbon-carbon double bonds called pi-bonds.  When these pi-bonds are irradiated with light of a certain wavelength, it enables the fluorophores to re-emit that light but with a different wavelength and much higher intensity.  This unique characteristic makes them particularly useful for bioimaging applications.  In this research, biocompatible amphiphilic polymers containing both water-loving (hydrophilic) and oil-loving (lipophilic) segments will first be prepared.  Their amphiphilic properties resemble those of other artificial compounds such as soaps and detergents, or even naturally occurring lipoproteins.  Synthesized polymers will then be assembled to create well-defined nanosized capsules which are capable to trap fluorophores.  Various dynamic processes that will occur during polymer assembly and encapsulation will be studied using several spectroscopic techniques.  Results associated with this research have the potential to advance the field of bioimaging and further understanding of optical properties of fluorophores in nanoconfined environments.  This work is a multi-disciplinary study in which fundamental aspects of development will provide fertile ground for the training of early career scientists and offer design guidelines toward functional polymeric materials.  Specific outreach endeavors will focus on research activities for transfer students and/or students having nontraditional academic paths as they make up a significant portion of the collegiate population in the state of Mississippi.  The research will equip the next generation of scientists with the skills, collaborative spirit, and creativity to solve complex societal problems.  A diverse scholastic population will also become more exposed to the emerging and dynamic area of fluorescence imaging, preparing them to contribute to an expanding STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce.  <br/><br/>This research will develop new approaches to biocompatible organic fluorophores for fluorescence imaging.  Specific emphasis will be placed on developing linear-dendritic block copolymers and dye-polymer conjugates with optical properties in the second near-infrared window (NIR-II, 1000?1400 nm), which has emerged as a high-priority in recent years due to poor stability and biocompatibility of current agents.  By employing amphiphilic substrates, the fundamental mechanism of self-assembly that results in well-defined, uniform nanostructures ideal for fluorescence imaging will be elucidated.  From the point of view of macromolecular design, linear-dendritic block copolymers will be synthesized with hydrophobic blocks consisting of polyesters such as polylactides and polycaprolactones.  Hydrophilic dendritic branches will be composed of polyamidoamines. NIR-II fluorescent dyes with aggregation-induced emissive molecular frameworks capable of self-assembling into monodisperse micellar structures will be strategically designed with thienothiadiazole and thienoselenadiazole units as the core acceptor structures.

He will study how various properties of a contact structure, such as Giroux torsion, fillability, and virtual overtwistedness, behave under surgery. The Principal Investigator will also start a project to classify contact structures on all small Seifert fibered spaces (and some large ones) and study their contact geometric properties. Riemannian metrics have long been known to have deep connections with the smooth topology of manifolds and more recently it has been shown that contact structures do as well. The Principal Investigator will continue to explore relations between these two geometric structures with the goal of seeing key properties of a contact structure (such as tightness) reflected in Riemannian metrics that are adapted to them. This will hopefully lead to a more complete understanding of the general picture of contact structures on 3 manifolds and create new tools for studying higher dimensional contact manifolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An example of this situation is the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where these effects lead to ``reflective"" spreading waves, resulting in hard to predict/control multiple phases of infection spread. To enhance pandemic preparedness and make healthcare systems and governments ready to optimally respond to potential future airborne epidemic disease, it is imperative to generate accurate network models of our connected society and disease spread. Using such realistic models, optimal control strategies can be synthesized that take into account the complex behavior caused by time delays in the network. This project will address this unmet need, which will have a significant social impact and can help stakeholders design strategies to manage a pandemic situation. Education is proactively integrated into this project at all levels, from outreach to pre-college students to graduate training. The strategy to broaden participation will leverage PIs? connections to institutional resources and programs to help recruit students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Effective mitigation of pandemics spreading over networks requires: (a) unveiling the topology, dynamics and delays of the underlying network from experimental data; (b) use of this information to design networks that can robustly minimize the systemic effects of localized infection foci, while respecting overall minimum traffic constraints; and (c) synthesizing real-time optimal control laws that adjust local parameters to prevent the onset of delay-induced echoing waves of pandemic spread. This research seeks to achieve these objectives by embedding the problem into a more general one: data-driven control synthesis for networked systems in the presence of delay-induced non-minimum phase/non-passive behavior, in scenarios where the interconnection structure of the system may not be perfectly known a priori. This embedding allows for exploiting a rich knowledge base, ranging from non-linear identification and semi-algebraic optimization to passivity-based control of networks, leading to a computationally tractable framework. Topology identification will be accomplished through an atomic norm framework. Network synthesis will combine ideas from network control and occupation measures to design and maintain optimal topologies at a slow time scale. Real-time optimal control laws will use event-triggered passivation to prevent delay-induced instabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because of their wide utility, N-heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are a particularly important class of catalysts that has garnered a lot of attention in the past few decades. NHCs are sensitive compounds that can degrade if exposed directly to air or moisture; therefore, small molecules can be used to hide, or ?mask?, the NHC reactivity until heat or light is used to release the NHC catalyst at the desired time. Despite extensive work in this area, little is known about how changing the small molecule ?mask? can tune the exact conditions under which the NHC will release. The Lamb group will explore new mask structures that will be used to systematically study how changes in the mask will alter the catalytic behavior of the NHCs. The work has broad implications for designing new releasable catalysts, catalyst recycling, and polymer synthesis in the future. The project lies at the intersection of catalysis, polymer, and physical organic chemistry and thus will provide excellent interdisciplinary training and education to the supported graduate and undergraduate students. The Lamb group is composed of a diverse group of scientists who are actively engaged in outreach activities focused on recruiting and retaining underrepresented scholars in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields.<br/><br/>Latent/switchable catalysis uses external stimuli to control when and where chemical reactions take place. N-Heterocyclic carbenes (NHCs) are powerful, tunable organocatalysts, but their sensitivity to air and moisture often necessitates the use of latent catalysis through the use of ?masked? NHCs. Current masked NHC systems are limited because the adduct bond strength is controlled by the structure of the NHC, leading to a trade-off between latency and activity of the catalyst. This project will investigate fundamental structure-property relationships that dictate NHC adduct bond stability and release by changing the mask, not the catalyst, structure. Specifically, the Lamb group will investigate carbodiimides and triarylboranes as modular mask scaffolds that can be activated using heat or light as the external stimulus. This work will apply physical organic techniques to understand and predict structure-property relationships first between mask structure and adduct stability then further correlate that stability to catalyst activity. The work will have societal impact in terms of education of undergraduate and graduate students ? including students from underrepresented groups ? publication of research that increases fundamental chemical knowledge, and through supporting Dr. Lamb?s outreach activities focused on recruiting and retaining underrepresented scholars in chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The development of new and more powerful devices requires new functional materials. Semiconducting perovskite nanomaterials are among the most promising ones to be used in next-generation optoelectronic devices. Their further application, however, is constrained by their poor stability and processability. With this LEAPS-MPS project, Professor Weinan Xu at the University of Akron proposes to overcome those limitations by designing soft and stretchable hybrid materials composed of perovskite nanomaterials and thermoplastic elastomers.  The soft copolymer matrix protects the perovskite nanomaterials and at the same time controls their alignment and assembly, so that multifunctional, highly stable, and stretchable optical materials will be generated. This project will also contribute to the education of next-generation polymer and materials scientists and engineers and promote STEM education to the general public.  Educational programs on nanomaterials and polymers will be implemented with local schools and science centers. The hands-on activities and demonstrations of nanomaterials and polymers in our daily life will stimulate younger generations? interests in science and engineering. <br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Semiconducting perovskite nanomaterials have promising applications in optoelectronics, energy conversion, advanced lighting and displays. But several major challenges need to be addressed before their full potential can be achieved, which include poor stability and the lack of efficient nanopatterning methods. This LEAPS-MPS award aims to address those challenges by integrating perovskite nanoparticles with block copolymer thermoplastic elastomers in a molecularly precise and synergistic way. The surface chemistry of the perovskite nanoparticles and the ionic state of the polymer blocks in the thermoplastic elastomers will be designed and customized, so that high compatibility and strong preferential interactions between the perovskite nanoparticles and a particular polymer block will be achieved. Two or multiple types of perovskite nanoparticles with different optical properties will be simultaneously patterned based on their selective affinity with the functionalized polymer blocks in the copolymers. Multifunctional, highly stable, and stretchable perovskite-copolymer composite materials will be created and systematically investigated with high-resolution microscopies, spectroscopies, and multiscale simulation. This project is interdisciplinary, and it provides opportunities for training students in different areas of materials chemistry, colloidal science, microfabrication, and device engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will focus on the mathematical analysis of migration patterns of interfacial layers and microfluidic flows in novel materials to understand their mechanisms and predict their patterns.

This project supports experimental research and education in magnetic topological metals, materials with unique properties and potential for use in advanced technologies. For example, magnetic topological metals host different memory states with a fictitious magnetic field pointing in different directions.

In synthetic systems, using light as a trigger to initiate processes is beneficial because it is often biocompatible, and can be well controlled in both time and space, especially through the use of ultrafast lasers. This proposal seeks to use light to trigger structural changes in macromolecules, such as in DNA assemblies and molecular storage compartments known as vesicles. Vesicles are of interest because they provide the ability to compartmentalize contents, preventing interaction with the surrounding environment; light-induced structural disruption could allow for their contents to be released on-demand. In order for this to happen, light must be converted into heat or mechanical energy which can disrupt surrounding structures. This can be achieved with the unique light-sensitive properties of small gold particles known as nanoparticles, sometimes only consisting of a few hundred atoms. DNA assemblies can assist in this process by providing a scaffold for nanoparticle placement. The thorough investigation of these interactions has the potential to be transformative for applications in biotechnology and nanotechnology, for example, drug-delivery, allowing for therapeutics to be released in a specific location within the body to reduce side effects in healthy tissues or cells. In addition to important scientific applications, a significant goal of this proposal is to provide experiential learning opportunities for students at Rutgers University-Camden. Such opportunities are essential on this campus, to increase engagement in the large population of first-generation college students as well as students who identify with groups commonly underrepresented in STEM fields. Recruitment, training, and mentoring will ensure that students become highly competitive for future endeavors in industry and academia. The campus location in the heart of Camden, NJ provides unmatched opportunities for outreach in the surrounding community. Towards this goal, an outreach program called MEDIA (Meeting Exceptional Diverse Inclusive Academics) will be launched, where a diverse group of scientists from Rutgers-Camden will interact with grade school students; the goal of this program is early intervention to dissuade common scientist gender and race stereotypes frequently portrayed by the media that can limit interest in and later pursuit of scientific study.<br/><br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Plasmonic nanoparticles, such as those comprised of gold, hold great potential as photosensitizers due to their unique optical properties which allow them to strongly absorb light and convert that energy into a localized response; the localized surface plasmon resonance absorption wavelength can be readily tuned through size, shape, organization, and composition. This plasmonic response can result in thermal and/or mechanical disruptions to the surrounding environment. This proposal hypothesizes that plasmonic effects can disrupt both the local organization of both diblock copolymer bilayer membranes which make up polymersome carrier vesicles, as well as DNA origami assemblies, both together and individually. The first aim of this work proposes to address the level of disruptions (i.e., poration vs. thermal dissociation). In Aim 2, the fundamental knowledge acquired in Aim 1 will be used to rationally design polymersome-DNA heterovesicles. The ability to control and detect the macromolecular organization of each component will be developed, to gain high spatiotemporal control over dissociation, poration, and cargo release in response to pulsed irradiation. Synergistically, this work will open doors to many training opportunities for undergraduate, M.S., and Ph.D. students at Rutgers-Camden, creating a hierarchy of opportunity, mentorship, and productivity. A large emphasis will be on the recruitment and retention of first generation college students and students from groups underrepresented in STEM, by providing paid research training and creating a sense of belonging in the scientific community through opportunities such as conference presentations. Proposed outreach programs in grade schools in the local Camden, NJ community will ensure the future diversity of STEM scholars by working towards offsetting the commonly media portrayed racial and gender stereotypes of scientists, through a program entitled MEDIA (Meeting Exceptional Diverse Inclusive Academics).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A microrobot the same size as an insect that can jump to heights over ten times its own body length has the potential to explore unknown and changing environments, such as subterranean caves, disaster rubble, or even the surface of other planets.This project will create jumping microrobots that will reach new levels of control and autonomy. This work will create a mathematical and experimental framework that uncovers how energy is released by a latch. This framework will connect features of robot design with control to push the boundaries of autonomy in jumping microrobots. The huge leaps in small robots make this project an excellent candidate for outreach activities in robotics research. Undergraduate researchers will be recruited through a project portal at the University at Buffalo that provides equitable access to research opportunities to a diverse student population across the university. <br/><br/>The research plan in this project works toward the principled design of jumping microrobots with controllable jump heights, a part of the latch-mediated spring actuation (LaMSA) framework. In this framework, springs are loaded but blocked by a latch, and the jump occurs when the latch is removed. Control in jumping robots has largely been through spring loaded, but this project focuses on understanding the dynamics of unlatching as a new axis of control in jumping microrobots. This is particularly important for the incredibly fast time scales of spring actuation. First, a thorough understanding of the dynamics of unlatching will be elucidated through mathematical and physical models. A new understanding of the dynamics of unlatching will become a pathway for control in jumping microrobots, to either produce the same, stereotyped jumping behavior with different initial conditions, or variable behavior with the same initial conditions. These research efforts will be a pathway toward a general understanding of dynamics and control of unlatching, and lead to a principled framework for the design and control of jumping microrobots.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One aspect of this uncertainty concerns how the solid Earth responds to melting ice in the form of post-glacial rebound, that is, uplift of crust after the weight of the ice has been removed.  This project will examine the behavior of the Earth beneath the ice sheet that covered northwest Scotland during the Last Glacial Maximum, 20,000 years ago.  As the earth warmed following the Last Glacial Maximum the ice sheet shrank and around 17,000 years ago a portion of the ice sheet over northwest Scotland experienced a ?collapse? or period of fast retreat.  The research will use records of past sea levels to document the behavior of the Earth beneath the front of this retreating ice sheet to determine if it rebounded (uplifted) fast enough to help stabilize the retreating ice sheet. There will also be numerical experiments to recreate the behavior of the Earth and ice sheet during this time period and compare these model experiments with measured records of past sea level changes across Scotland.  These comparisons will permit new insights into the behavior of retreating ice sheets and provide better constraints on the history and size of the ice sheet that once covered northwest Scotland.  The project will conduct a three-week in-residence summer camp for students from high schools with large minority populations to introduce them to the varied dimensions of Earth Science. <br/> <br/>The purpose of this research is to investigate the importance of sea-level feedbacks in stabilizing marine-based ice sheets during their retreat.  The proposed investigation will combine new late Pleistocene/Holocene relative sea-level constraints to be collected from raised shorelines, existing offshore marine cores, and isolation basins from across northwestern Scotland, to refine the glacial isostatic adjustment models for the British Isles.  The proposal will also investigate sea-level feedbacks at a more local level and at the scale of the Late Pleistocene ice stream that once flowed through the Minch of northwestern Scotland using a more specialized ice-sheet model.  This model, coupled with results from an improved ?global? scale glacial isostatic adjustment model for the British Isles, will be used to understand the sensitivity of the former Minch ice stream to more local variables (e.g. mantle rheology, lithospheric thickness, ice sheet geometry, etc.). Three hypotheses will be tested: 1.) Sea-level feedback did not provide a stabilizing influence for the Minch Ice Stream during its retreat following the Last Glacial Maximum; 2.) along indented ice-sheet margins, sea-level feedbacks are governed not by the local ice front but by regional isostatic adjustment; and 3.) the influence of sea-level feedback in stabilizing marine ice streams is a function of the rheology of the Earth beneath it.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It aims at enhancing our knowledge in mathematics as well as in physics. The new insights and methods from this project will also be important to solve other structurally similar PDE. These PDE are at the heart of models in science and technology, from physics to biology and chemistry to finance, economics or medicine and psychology. Independent from their roots in various applications, these PDE and their solutions frequently exhibit similar interesting structures that are investigated by mathematical methods from geometric analysis. Consequently, mathematical results in one direction may open doors to solving problems in entirely different fields or applications. One main research  direction of the project concerns the Einstein equations from general relativity theory, which are the laws of the universe, linking its physical content to geometry. This theory is also crucial to make GPS work. Investigating these equations will increase our understanding of the universe both in the large as well as in smaller regions such as galaxies, binary neutron stars or binary black holes. Beyond that, this project will not only answer open questions in physics, but also create new ideas for physical models. When two massive objects like neutron stars or black holes merge, then gravitational waves are produced and travel from the source through the universe as ripples in spacetime. For the first time, such waves were observed in 2015 by Advanced LIGO (aLIGO), marking the beginning of a new era where information from distant regions of the universe is decoded directly from the universe itself (different from telescopes). Unraveling the new structures will rely on synergies between mathematics, astrophysics and physics. The project will build on the PI?s prior results to develop new methods to achieve these goals. The project will also have direct impact in a broader sense via teaching and outreach activities. The PI will train students and postdocs in these fields and educate the general public through broad outreach activities. The PI will attend conferences to communicate the results. The PI will also make the results available via the internet and publications.  <br/><br/>In this project the PI will develop new mathematical methods to investigate the Einstein equations and other nonlinear PDE describing physical phenomena. The PI will investigate: (1) the Cauchy problem for the Einstein equations focusing on (I) spacetimes with radiation, and (II) the formation of black holes in GR when the Einstein equations are coupled to matter systems, (2) the mathematics of gravitational waves, their memory and related effects in GR as well as analogs of memory in other physical theories, (3) Euler equations and other PDE. These main directions comprise several projects. Many of them will rely on the PI's former results but also require new ideas and new mathematical methods. The PI's recent results for the Einstein equations in vacuum and with neutrino radiation revealed a panorama of new structures in gravitational radiation and memory that are expected to be seen in current and future gravitational wave detectors. Parts of the planned research link the mathematical insights to experiments (LIGO/VIRGO in particular). Moreover, the gravitational wave memory is expected to be detected in the near future. The PI and D. Garfinkle derived two analogs of memory within the electromagnetic theory. These are expected to be measured in an experiment as well. The mathematical methods are widely applicable to a broad spectrum of problems from mathematics to physics. The PI and collaborators will continue their research to complete the understanding of gravitational radiation and memory in GR, and to extend their research to other physical theories. The PI's research on the mathematical investigation of the Einstein equations in GR provides geometric-analytic methods to tackle other PDE. Moreover, newly found structures will be important in geometry as well as in PDE theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program in the Division of Materials Research, aims to understand acoustic phonons in 2D materials, filling a major gap in fundamental knowledge while addressing the outstanding question: Where is the cross-over from bulk to quantum acoustic phonon behavior in a 2D material? This effort develops a transformative set of solid-state chemistry techniques to synthesize and chemically control the fundamental acoustic phonon behavior of 2D oxide and chalcogenide (S, Se, Te-based) materials. These materials are generated using new synthetic routes to heterostructures and new zero-valent intercalation chemistries. Brillouin laser light scattering spectroscopy is used to measure and understand acoustic phonons in 2D layered materials. Measurements give complete acoustic phonon dispersion relations, sound velocities, refractive indices, mechanical properties, and stiffness coefficients of 2D materials from the bulk to a monolayer. This effort lays critical foundation for the fundamental understanding and chemical control of phonons in 2D materials for future application. This work develops, enhances, and expands upon an online Brillouin spectroscopy database complementing similarly available databases in Raman and X-ray Diffraction.

This fellowship to Dr. Sanchez supports her research project entitled ""MPS-Ascend: Disentangling the Complexities of Galaxy Evolution Using Genetically Modified Galaxies"", under the mentorship of a sponsoring scientist. The host institution for the fellowship is Carnegie Observatories, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Andrew Benson.<br/><br/>Decades of observations have shown that large scale gas outflows driven by energetic processes are critical in galaxy evolution. Such flows inhibit and regulate  star formation. Stellar feedback from supernova and stellar winds is an important source of energy for driving outflows as are winds from Super Massive Black Holes (SMBH). Amidst the complicated backdrop of galaxy formation?such as ongoing major and minor mergers, inflowing gas filaments, cooling gas flows, and feedback processes?unraveling the cause and effect of physical processes proves a challenge. The PI will use numerical simulations to create ""Genetically Modified"" (GM) galaxies: simulations based on nearly identical initial conditions with slightly changed galaxy accretion histories. The controlled experiments of the GM technique  isolate the impact of different assembly histories, SMBH feedback implementation, and star formation histories to disentangle the complicated dynamical processes that drive galaxy formation.<br/><br/>Working with Community Colleges in Pasadena and the Cal Bridge Program,  the  PI will create and run a two-week, intensive coding summer school each year that includes teaching python coding skills, practical research experience with multiple forms of astrophysical data, and lectures on STEM-focused careers. The goal of this program is to increase the support for and retention of historically marginalized students in STEM-fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop a methodology for deciphering the complex behavior of the equations modeling optics and water waves phenomena in bounded regions and will provide tools to understand and design physical and numerical experiments, especially in the direction of capturing novel unexplored behaviors. The investigator will engage both undergraduate and graduate students in the project, in line with a commitment to the training of future generations of mathematicians and the promotion of diversity in the field of mathematics and beyond.<br/><br/>The project involves three main components. The first component considers nonlinear Schrdinger-type equations in higher than one space dimensions. The second focuses on equations in higher dimensional bounded domains with an emphasis on completely integrable models. This direction will exploit the rich mathematical structure of integrable equations and provide rigorous results on a currently largely unexplored area.

Existing mathematical frameworks, however, have been slow to adapt to sudden changes in disease spread dynamics resulting from the waning vaccine immunity and emergence of COVID-19 variants such as delta and omicron. This project will address these challenges by developing data-driven mathematical modeling tools which divide populations according to factors that have distinct characteristics, such as those due to differences in vaccination status and the spread of virus variants. As COVID-19 evolves and becomes endemic in the global population, the developed frameworks will guide public health officials in evaluating the effectiveness of potential vaccination strategies and assessing the capacity of variants to alter the course of disease spread. This will facilitate targeted and impactful policies rather than disruptive population-wide restrictions and lockdowns. The project will engage undergraduate students in topical applied mathematics research and support underrepresented students in STEM with a particular focus on the African American community in Metro Detroit.  The project will additionally advance curricular and program development at Lawrence Technological University, which will enhance the institution's research environment and further the principal investigator?s professional goal of establishing a sustained, student-focused, and interdisciplinary research program in mathematical biology at Lawrence Technological University.<br/><br/>Traditional mathematical modeling frameworks of infectious disease spread often ignore factors of heterogeneous spread within a population. This can lead to poor estimates of epidemiological parameters (such as the basic reproduction number and herd immunity threshold), mistaken assessments of the mechanisms of disease spread, and inaccurate forecasts. This project will develop the theory and application of compartmental SIR-type (Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered) models, which are associated with a system of ordinary differential equations, to incorporate variances in a population's vaccination coverage level, differing waning immunity periods, and competition between virus variants with distinct epidemiological characteristics. Waning immunity will be incorporated through a gamma-distributed delay on return to susceptibility after vaccination or previous infection. The resulting distributed delay differential equations will be analyzed and numerically simulated using the linear chain trick, which reduces gamma-distributed delays to a linear chain of exponential delays. Case data from The Michigan Department of Health and Human Services will be used to parametrize and validate the models with the goal of providing insightful forecasts for the spread of COVID-19 under different immunization schedules. Virus variants will be incorporated by dividing the infectious class into distinct compartments with variant-specific parameters, such as variances in transmissibility, severity, vaccine resistance, reinfection rate, and diagnostic detection. The goal will be to establish novel critical thresholds for when a virus variant can persist or become dominant in a population as well as address the inverse question of estimating a variant's epidemiological parameters from its early-stage growth. By controlling a population's vaccination coverage level, the developed models will be able to cut through the complexity of case incidence data to provide critical insights into the primary factors driving disease spread. User-friendly computational packages capable of implementing the models and interfacing with public health databases will be developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One aspect of this uncertainty concerns how the solid Earth responds to melting ice in the form of post-glacial rebound, that is, uplift of crust after the weight of the ice has been removed.  This project will examine the behavior of the Earth beneath the ice sheet that covered northwest Scotland during the Last Glacial Maximum, 20,000 years ago.  As the earth warmed following the Last Glacial Maximum the ice sheet shrank and around 17,000 years ago a portion of the ice sheet over northwest Scotland experienced a ?collapse? or period of fast retreat.  The research will use records of past sea levels to document the behavior of the Earth beneath the front of this retreating ice sheet to determine if it rebounded (uplifted) fast enough to help stabilize the retreating ice sheet. There will also be numerical experiments to recreate the behavior of the Earth and ice sheet during this time period and compare these model experiments with measured records of past sea level changes across Scotland.  These comparisons will permit new insights into the behavior of retreating ice sheets and provide better constraints on the history and size of the ice sheet that once covered northwest Scotland.  The project will conduct a three-week in-residence summer camp for students from high schools with large minority populations to introduce them to the varied dimensions of Earth Science. <br/> <br/>The purpose of this research is to investigate the importance of sea-level feedbacks in stabilizing marine-based ice sheets during their retreat.  The proposed investigation will combine new late Pleistocene/Holocene relative sea-level constraints to be collected from raised shorelines, existing offshore marine cores, and isolation basins from across northwestern Scotland, to refine the glacial isostatic adjustment models for the British Isles.  The proposal will also investigate sea-level feedbacks at a more local level and at the scale of the Late Pleistocene ice stream that once flowed through the Minch of northwestern Scotland using a more specialized ice-sheet model.  This model, coupled with results from an improved ?global? scale glacial isostatic adjustment model for the British Isles, will be used to understand the sensitivity of the former Minch ice stream to more local variables (e.g. mantle rheology, lithospheric thickness, ice sheet geometry, etc.). Three hypotheses will be tested: 1.) Sea-level feedback did not provide a stabilizing influence for the Minch Ice Stream during its retreat following the Last Glacial Maximum; 2.) along indented ice-sheet margins, sea-level feedbacks are governed not by the local ice front but by regional isostatic adjustment; and 3.) the influence of sea-level feedback in stabilizing marine ice streams is a function of the rheology of the Earth beneath it.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Synthetic molecules enhance daily life through new medicine, agricultural advances, and cutting-edge technologies. Organohalogens are a class of compound that may facilitate the synthesis of these molecules by acting as catalysts or reagents that introduce key structural components. In some cases, it is probable that organohalogens may replace expensive and rare metals that are commonly used in synthesis. To fully realize the potential of hypervalent organohalogens in synthesis, a deeper understanding of fundamental bonding events is needed. This will be achieved through a combined experimental and theoretical approach applied in this work. Training of the next generation of scientists will occur with this award by including graduate and undergraduate students in research. Portland State University is recognized as a ?First-gen Forward? Institution, which enables inclusion of first-generation college students in research experiences. Finally, during this award period the principal investigators will increase access to laboratory research for blind high school students through a day camp at PSU.<br/><br/>Non-covalent bonding interactions are a cornerstone of the reactivity of hypervalent organohalogens, yet the underlying atomic-level properties that dictate their strength are not well understood. With this award, the principal investigators tackle non-covalent interactions of hypervalent halogens from multiple perspectives. Both theoretical and empirical approaches are employed to gain new insight into halogen bonding and the bifunctional character of diaryliodonium salts. They will use a combination of physical organic chemistry techniques (conductance, NMR titration, kinetics) and theory (DFT and NBO) to correlate bonding models with structure and thermodynamic/kinetic reactivity. They will specifically focus on three key areas: 1) the orbital interaction of halogen atoms in halogen-bond donors, 2) bifunctional character of diarylhalonium salts when participating in non-covalent interactions, and 3) reactions of diarylhaloniums with pronucleophiles based on bifunctional activation. These activities, when completed, would contribute to advances in new synthetic methods and catalysis for organic synthesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Engineering students participate at lower rates, and racially and economically minoritized college/university students are the least likely to have the opportunity to participate. In addition, such international trips rarely take place in sub-Saharan Africa. To address this need, this IRES Track 1 project supports U.S. underrepresented students in conducting research in community-engaged engineering and the design of localized engineering education in Eldoret, Kenya. Students will work with research mentors in social work, engineering, and from the community itself, which will support their critical understanding of collaboration in international development and engineering problem-solving. We work across two collaborating institutions, Purdue University (PU) and San Francisco State University (SFSU), and we engage two departments at Moi University in Kenya, Education/Social Work and Engineering, and a community partner organization, Tumaini Innovation Center. This project will allow a broader population of U.S. engineering students to participate in an international research experience. This program gives first-generation, racially-minoritized, or low socioeconomic-status students the opportunity to carry out research abroad and experience the research process while also empowering them through mentorship and reflection. The student research projects will expand existing research in both Kenya and the U.S. in community-engaged engineering and localized engineering education.<br/><br/>This project addresses an integrated set of research and practice aims, both through the research that student IRES participants will conduct and in the thoughtful evaluation of the program. First, the research conducted by the student researchers will contribute to rich scholarship in both community-engaged engineering and the development of localized engineering teaching and learning. There is a great need for additional research on how engineers can engage with communities in just and sustainable ways and for how engineering education can meet the unique needs of individual communities and student populations. The IRES student research projects have the potential to identify opportunities and approaches for developing engineering education that builds effectively on local knowledge. Second, the evaluation of this program can contribute to our understanding of student learning, intercultural growth, and experiences in international research. In particular, our project will focus on racially and economically marginalized and first-generation students, who are typically not represented in existing research on such programs. Through our engagement with multiple U.S. institutions (Purdue and SFSU) and our focused engagement with groups that support underrepresented students in engineering at both institutions, our IRES program will provide a mechanism for broad impacts on the fields of engineering education and engineering practice.

The problems considered in this project are of foundational nature, and answers to these are expected to lead to new techniques and interactions among different fields of mathematics and have potential applications in string theory.

Another project aims to understand the properties of the Gromov-Witten virtual fundamental cycle in symplectic geometry and explore its functorial aspects.

An example of this situation is the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, where these effects lead to ``reflective"" spreading waves, resulting in hard to predict/control multiple phases of infection spread. To enhance pandemic preparedness and make healthcare systems and governments ready to optimally respond to potential future airborne epidemic disease, it is imperative to generate accurate network models of our connected society and disease spread. Using such realistic models, optimal control strategies can be synthesized that take into account the complex behavior caused by time delays in the network. This project will address this unmet need, which will have a significant social impact and can help stakeholders design strategies to manage a pandemic situation.  Education is proactively integrated into this project at all levels, from outreach to pre-college students to graduate training. The strategy to broaden participation will leverage PIs? connections to institutional resources and programs to help recruit students from underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Effective mitigation of pandemics spreading over networks requires: (a) unveiling the topology, dynamics and delays of the underlying network from experimental data; (b) use of this information to design networks that can robustly minimize the systemic effects of localized infection foci, while respecting overall minimum traffic constraints; and (c) synthesizing real-time optimal control laws that adjust local parameters to prevent the onset of delay-induced echoing waves of pandemic spread. This research seeks to achieve these objectives by embedding the problem into a more general one: data-driven control synthesis for networked systems in the presence of delay-induced non-minimum phase/non-passive behavior, in scenarios where the interconnection structure of the system may not be perfectly known a priori. This embedding allows for exploiting a rich knowledge base, ranging from non-linear identification and semi-algebraic optimization to passivity-based control of networks, leading to a computationally tractable framework. Topology identification will be accomplished through an atomic norm framework. Network synthesis will combine ideas from network control and occupation measures to design and maintain optimal topologies at a slow time scale. Real-time optimal control laws will use event-triggered passivation to prevent delay-induced instabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A novel approach to test antimicrobial drugs is to measure the effect of the drug on the microbes within living cells. Light reflected by small collections of living cells can sense when the cells are infected with microbes because the infection changes how the internal cellular machinery works. The use of natural intracellular motions in cell clusters that act as ?sentinels? is an unprecedented new approach to detecting microbes. To further educational goals, the effect of cellular motion on reflected light will be easily demonstrated to high-school students using simple laser pointers and cell phone cameras.<br/><br/>To improve the discovery of new antimicrobial compounds, a new physics-based optical screening technology will be developed to fill this need.  Biodynamic Doppler profiling (BDP) performs Doppler spectroscopy of intracellular motions inside living tissue using low-coherence digital holography.  It is a sensitive probe of the subtle changes of cellular dynamics caused by drugs or infections inside tissue.  Biodynamic profiling has already been used to predict the response of cancer patients to chemotherapy by applying cancer drugs on living ex vivo biopsies.  In this project the team will develop Doppler detection of bacterial infection of living-tissue sentinels.  The premise of living-tissue sentinels is that the sentinel behavior is modified by early infection before the bacteria can be characterized directly themselves.  In the proposed research, biodynamic profiling of microbial invasion will be extended along several lines by: 1) enhancing the sensitivity of the sentinels to detect lower-level bacterial infections; 2) assembling a library of sentinel response functions to microbial infection; 3) performing quantitative assays of antibiotic resistance; 4) demonstrating the first detection of viral infections of tissue sentinels, and 5) developing new deep-learning algorithms to classify pathogenicity and predict therapeutic efficacy.

This approach has wide applications in physics and engineering, but also within mathematics itself. A special focus of harmonic analysis is to obtain good quantitative information on the objects in question, which can often be applied to yield strong quantitative results in the fields of ergodic theory and combinatorics. Ergodic theory investigates behavior of dynamical systems that evolve for a long time, while one focus of combinatorics is to study existence of structures in large but otherwise arbitrary sets. These structures can be geometric patterns such as arithmetic progressions, vertices of a square, their translates, rotates, or dilates. The project will focus on the study of integral transformations that naturally occur within harmonic analysis and build a set of tools that further expands the reach of harmonic analysis into the nearby fields of ergodic theory and combinatorics. As these are very foundational subjects, the results and techniques from these areas are applicable in a wider scientific context. Examples include applications in stochastic analysis, partial differential equations, signal processing, and medical imaging. The project?s fundamental mathematical research will address the community?s currently relevant scientific questions in its continued pursuit in understanding open mathematical questions. The project will further entail working with a postdoc and mentoring undergraduate students, organization of seminars and workshops that promote cross-collaboration and exchange of ideas. <br/><br/>The first part of this project will deal with a fundamental family of multilinear singular integral forms with a hypergraph structure. The main goal will be to address boundedness of these forms on Lebesgue spaces. These questions will be approached by extending the techniques previously developed by the PI and collaborators. The work is partially inspired by a major open question in harmonic analysis, boundedness of the simplex Hilbert transforms. Further, this project will address multilinear oscillatory integral forms and their connections with variants of multilinear singular integrals and maximal functions with curvature. Estimates on multilinear singular and oscillatory integrals will then be applied to ergodic theory. In this context, the main goal will be to investigate convergence of various types of ergodic averages along the orbits of commuting measure-preserving transformations by establishing qualitative convergence statements via stronger quantitative variational estimates. The latter will be translated to questions in Euclidean spaces and addressed with harmonic analysis techniques developed throughout this project. These methods will also be applied to questions in Euclidean Ramsey theory, where existence of linear and non-linear point configurations in large subsets of the Euclidean space will be investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, groups confront different types of discrimination, which creates a problem that may not have merely one solution. Some discriminatory actions and practices involve taking advantage of racial and ethnic groups in ways that benefit some Americans and keep relative group status and economic positions stratified (i.e., exploitation). Other discriminatory actions and practices involve preserving traditional notions of what it means to be American and denying racial and ethnic groups their own American national identity (i.e., exclusion). The current project examines when and why these different forms of racial and ethnic discrimination are likely to occur, as well as the self-reinforcing nature of discrimination. <br/><br/>The broad aim of this research is to provide important insights into the complex nature of racial and ethnic discrimination. Seven studies employ survey and experimental methods to investigate the cognitive, motivational, and social factors that lead to the exploitation and exclusion of racial and ethnic groups. First, this research tests specific predictions of the racial and ethnic stereotypes that tend to cause unique forms of discrimination. Perceiving a group as low status likely gives rise to exploitation, whereas perceiving a group as culturally foreign gives rise to exclusion. Second, this research examines the individual differences and social contexts that motivate some Americans to maintain socioeconomic differences between groups and preserve dominant cultural values and practices. Third, this research explores how exposure to existing patterns of exploitation and exclusion reinforce stereotypes about group status and cultural foreignness; those stereotypes, in turn, reproduce the same patterns of discrimination. This project advances an understanding of the psychological mechanisms of racial discrimination, provides mentorship opportunities to young researchers of color, and develops educational activities that foster awareness of racism. The project will contribute to precise and group-specific efforts that can reduce discrimination.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When an oceanic tectonic plate sinks, or subducts, underneath a continental plate, forming a volcanic arc, these volatiles delivered by the oceanic plate are released in volcanos and seeps across the entire arc system. The efficiency of this transfer controls the composition of Earth?s mantle, atmospheric evolution, and possibly, the global distribution of microscopic life.

Volatiles are input via subduction and released in volcanos and seeps across the entire arc system. The efficiency of this transfer controls mantle heterogeneities, Earth?s redox conditions, atmospheric evolution, and possibly, the global distribution of microscopic life. Despite the importance of global-scale deep volatile cycles, volatile fluxes have not been extensively studied in submarine volcanic forearcs, as these regions are notoriously difficult to access. Recently emplaced boreholes provide a unique opportunity to sample large volumes of deeply-sourced pristine volatile-laden fluids across a wide expanse of the submarine Mariana forearc. However, volatile outfluxes may be complicated by the fact that shallow forearc temperatures are amenable to life, and thus some of these deeply derived (i.e., from the subducting slab and/or mantle) volatiles (e.g., CO2, CH4, NH4+) may be altered by subsurface microbes. This project will determine forearc volatile fluxes, quantifying biological and geochemical reactions by comparing fluxes of reactive volatiles (C, N) with inert indicators of mantle contributions (e.g., He) and the relative activity levels of known microbial metabolic pathways across a transect of the Mariana forearc. This project will leverage previously emplaced boreholes that have never been sampled for He, C, and N isotopes, or microbiology, to determine how volatile recycling efficiency is controlled by complex interactions between geochemical and biological processes in the Mariana forearc. Cased boreholes were recently installed in four active serpentinite mud volcanoes in the Southern Mariana forearc. Together, these four boreholes form a trench-parallel transect, enabling access to deep fluids from active serpentinite mud volcanoes across the Mariana forearc. This project will gather geochemical and biological data from these boreholes, enabling a systematic assessment of forearc volatile fluxes and the key processes (e.g., calcite precipitation, heterotrophy, autotrophy, respiration) mediating those fluxes. This will determine volatile (He, C and N) fluxes between Earth reservoirs and quantify their sources (slab, mantle wedge, crust) and sinks (geochemical and biological). Boreholes are located at different distances from the trench and the emanating fluids have varying pH and temperatures, so the dominant biological and geochemical processes at each borehole are expected to vary. In addition to training two PhD students and undergraduate students, the PIs have a broad outreach plan that incorporates media outlets and collaborations with science museums, local high schools, and undergraduate researchers. Specifically, the PIs will develop a series of four classroom lectures and activities aimed at a high-school level audience that leverages data and experiences from this project.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Today, knots play an important role in physics through gauge theory and quantum field theories, molecular biology via protein and DNA knotting, and low-dimensional topology in the form of handlebody diagrams of 4-manifolds and Dehn surgery descriptions of 3-manifolds.  In 2016 the PI initiated a novel approach to studying problems in knot theory by applying techniques of machine learning and artificial intelligence.  While there is now a small but growing body of research in this direction, with contributions from mathematicians, physicists, and computer scientists, most of the existing work focuses on techniques of supervised learning and applications of reinforcement learning to unknotting braids.  The PI will adapt new techniques from generative machine learning and reinforcement learning to study topological properties of knots and learn latent distributions of knots and their invariants.  The PI will also extend earlier work with collaborators, by establishing theoretical underpinnings of new observations and experimental results.  As part of this project the PI will develop a mentored data science research training program for undergraduate students, in which students will be mentored by both the PI and a data scientist from industry or academia.  Students will participate in a semester-long mentored learning group with the PI, before completing an intensive workshop where they work together to solve data science problems from industry with their external mentor.  At each step of this program, special attention will be given to increasing participation of historically underrepresented groups through partnerships with campus organizations that specialize in outreach to these communities.  By participating in mentored research these students will gain experience that will help them prepare for graduate degrees and careers in academia and industry, thereby preparing to be future role models for students from these underrepresented communities.<br/><br/>The PI will adapt text-to-image generative adversarial networks to construct invariant-to-knot GANs, allowing for the construction of knots with prescribed topological properties.  The PI will also use variational autoencoders to learn new latent distributions of knots which are natural with respect to various topological properties and invariants.  These latent representations of knots will provide a clearer understanding of knot distributions and produce random models that allow for targeted generation of knots with specified properties.  Any new latent representations of knot theoretic data will be made available to other researchers for use in training new machine learning models, improving the performance of the models being developed.   These techniques will be used to guide searches for counterexamples to important open conjectures.  In addition, the PI will use deep reinforcement learning algorithms to study the slice genus and braid band rank problems, generalizing existing results on the use of reinforcement learning to the unknotting of braids.  Given that the problem of computing the slice genus of knots is central to key open questions in low-dimensional topology and constructions in physics, new techniques developed here will have direct applications outside of knot theory.  Successful use of these techniques will serve as a template for future applications of generative machine learning and reinforcement learning to other areas of mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Foundational research in harmonic analysis endeavors to enrich the mathematical toolbox that these disciplines require to move forward and to provide unified perspectives that connect seemingly unrelated fields of science and mathematics. Of considerable interest is the study of various integral transforms such as the Hilbert transform, which can be understood as a frequency filter acting on a given signal and is a prototypical example of a singular integral operator. Other mathematical operators important to this project are the Fourier transform, which decomposes a signal into its frequency components, maximal functions and various Radon-type transforms. A basic example of a Radon-type transform is the X-ray transform, which is used in computerized tomography applications. In summary, the scientific goal of the project is to contribute to an improved theoretical understanding of these mathematical objects and their generalizations. The project will further entail organization of an online seminar series, writing a book on undergraduate analysis, curriculum improvement, and training of students.<br/><br/>The specific focus of the work will be on a variety of topics in real and discrete harmonic analysis. The first topic concerns spherical maximal operators associated with restricted sets of dilations on Euclidean spaces and Heisenberg groups.

A second topic concerns discrete analogues of classical operators in harmonic analysis related to maximally modulated singular integrals of Stein-Wainger type. This is motivated by fundamental conjectures in ergodic theory and will involve a combination of techniques from number theory and analysis. The third topic concerns multilinear singular integrals with Radon-type behavior such as triangular Hilbert transforms with curvature.

Exposure to criterial air pollutants such as fine particulate matter (PM2.5) and climate-driven pollutants such as black carbon (BC) is of increasing public health concern both nationally and globally. The use of low-cost air quality and greenhouse gas sensors can transform the ability of cities to understand and address air pollution challenges. This International Research Experience for Students (IRES) project will provide 24 U.S. underrepresented minority students (15 undergraduates and 9 graduates) the opportunity to participate in a ten-week summer program over three years for studying emerging air quality issues in Dhaka, Bangladesh, which is one of the most densely populated cities in the world. Each year a cohort of 8 students will participate in a two-week pre-departure virtual training and one-week (in-person) post-trip follow-up session in the U.S. and visit Dhaka for seven weeks to carry our collaborative research at the Bangladesh University of Engineering and Technology (BUET) and at the University of Dhaka. Bangladesh is known for its vulnerability to climate change, consistently ranked as one of the most polluted countries and Dhaka as one of the most polluted megacities in the world. The experiences and lessons learned from a megacity?s impact on air quality can be valuable for the IRES students to study large U.S. urban centers confronting similar air pollution challenges. This IRES will develop a diverse globally engaged workforce of young scientists to contribute broadly to enhance U.S. leadership in science and engineering. The international experiences will offer IRES students unique opportunities to enhance their professional growth, peer-mentoring skills, networking and develop their competencies in intercultural communication, self-awareness, professional adaptability, and leadership in a culturally diverse group. This IRES project will promote diversity in undergraduate and graduate education and also bring benefits to the society by increasing global awareness and yielding information that can support regulatory agencies to improve air quality and public health.<br/><br/>This IRES project aims to improve air quality by using low-cost approaches through integration of novel internet of things (IoT)-derived sensor technology and satellite remote sensing coupled with modeling to improve understanding of air pollution problems and their potential solutions. By leveraging the unique research facilities, data and other U.S. (e.g., Stanford University) and foreign resources, the IRES students will investigate emerging air quality issues in Bangladesh. Research activities using low-cost sensors include (1) development of a calibration framework for low-cost PM2.5 monitoring system, (2) developing a low-cost approach for evaluating brick kiln emissions, (3) high spatial resolution air pollution mapping in Dhaka city, (4) understanding residential indoor air quality exposure in Dhaka, (5) monitoring exposure to air pollutants and greenhouse gases in public transportation in Dhaka city, and (6) estimation and characterization of waste burning impact on air quality in Dhaka. Students will also use satellite remote sensing approach for mapping brick kiln pollution and perform evaluation of satellite-based models in estimating the surface PM2.5 concentrations over Bangladesh. Students will have the opportunity to select their individual research projects based on their personal interests. This project offers a robust student mentoring through student-faculty and student-student interactions and several events to enhance their professional development.

X-ray binaries (XRBs) consist of a neutron star or black hole that is actively accreting gas from a close companion star; this accretion is responsible for the emission of X-rays. Of particular interest are high-mass X-ray binaries (HMXBs), in which the companion star is more than 8 times the Sun's mass, as these will become binary black holes or neutron stars, capable of producing detectable gravitational waves when they merge. The high-energy photons radiated by XRBs can also heat a galaxy's gas reservoir sufficiently to ""act as a brake"" on star formation, particularly in the small, metal poor galaxies that dominate at high redshift. Moreover, HMXBs from the first generation of stars likely helped reionize the early universe. XRBs have thus played a significant role in the formation and evolution of galaxies. A better understanding of XRBs requires an appraisal of how they are affected by the age and metallicity of their environment. This project will characterize XRB populations in a sample of local galaxies having a range of chemical abundance, star formation history (SFH), and age to assess any such dependence. The proposal will support the mentoring of two undergraduate researchers each year, as well as an astronomy summer school (Cal Poly PASS) that will train roughly ten undergraduates per year, all drawn from under- represented or marginalized groups.<br/><br/>Research carried out by the principal investigator (PI) and students will determine the detailed shape of the XRB X-ray luminosity function (XLF) while controlling for environmental metallicity, SMH, and stellar age for individual XRBs within forth-eight nearby galaxies using multiwavelength archival data. The shape of the XLF is expected to evolve with metallicity and stellar age, along with substantial (and stochastic) variations in HMXB formation efficiency in local low-mass, low- metallicity galaxies that serve as analogs to the young galaxies found at high redshift. Understanding the XLF shape and scatter inherent in XRB scaling relations will be important for constraining XRB population synthesis models used in (e.g.) detailed galaxy evolution simulations, a clearer understanding of star formation suppression over cosmic time, and for a better sense of how these objects contribute to the reionization of the universe.

Despite the growing trend of analyzing such complex data to further our understanding of the molecular basis in states of human disease, the inherent biological heterogeneity is challenging the conventional paradigm to treat a given diseased system as a uniform entity: patients may form different disease subtypes present with variable clinical outcomes, and cells collected from the same patient sample may display different phenotypic states. Biological and clinical interpretability in the face of the high dimensional molecular features remain to be another challenge. The proposed project will address key challenges in: 1) simultaneously detecting biologically/clinically meaningful patient/cell subgroups and extracting their unique defining genomic features; and 2) integrated learning from data of multiple modalities, with strong systematic batch effect, or collected over time. Thus, the proposed work has high potential to discover new knowledge and to induce new approaches significant to health data science research. The project will result in algorithms, such as high dimensionality reduction, clustering and data integration, that are broadly applicable across the whole of data science, to address a wide range of research and industry needs.<br/><br/>This project proposes novel ideas of disentangled learning to simultaneously address the high dimensionality and inherent heterogeneity issues for three most popular biomedical data types: multi-omics, tissue resolved -omics, and longitudinal -omics data. The following three critical challenges are to be addressed: 1) Detecting biologically/clinically meaningful patient subgroups by leveraging multi-omics data through novel supervised clustering methods; 2) Discovering heterogeneous cell populations in noisy tissue resolved omics data and multi-task learning of multiple tissue samples through a Poisson based low dimensional embedding model; and 3) Characterizing heterogeneous disease trajectories using longitudinal and high dimensional -omics data through a fusion learning model. For all three scenarios, a common theme of disentangled learning is proposed to ensure the biological/clinical interpretability of the analysis results. The inherent heterogeneity within and across the subjects are divided to distinct subgroups or subpopulations, each of which is characterized by their unique features extracted from within a high dimensional feature space. All proposed methods are embraced with extensive utility in both academia and industry. Educationally, the proposed peer learning education module, R Shiny based tool development research, and summer workshops on data science, all targeting high school and undergraduate students, can well serve as a platform not only for inspiring and retaining students, but also training them for future STEM workforce roles. Thus, the proposed project is promising to have far-reaching educational impacts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A chiral molecule displays handedness; thus, there are left-handed and right-handed forms of the molecule and these forms rotate plane-polarized light waves in opposite directions. Understanding chiral molecules is especially important to the pharmaceutical industry as one chiral form may be of great medicinal value, while the other form may be of no value or even toxic. The accurate prediction of the optical properties of chiral molecules is a daunting task for computational chemistry. While computer models of simple molecular properties are well established, interactions of chiral molecules with light present unique challenges even for state-of-the-art computational methods. In this research project, Professor Crawford and coworkers are working to develop robust and accurate computational techniques that are less time-intensive than current methods. These computational tools have to potential to help researchers better understand the relationship between chiral molecular structures and their interactions with light.  Further, this research program will the provide for the education and training of graduate and undergraduate students in the fundamental theory and development of quantum chemical methods. Software developed during this project will be included in PSI4, a widely used computational chemistry package that is freely available to the community. Dr. Crawford is one of the lead developers of PSI4.<br/><br/>Under this award, Professor Daniel Crawford and coworkers at Virginia Tech will endeavor to advance the high-accuracy modeling of chiroptical properties by streamlining coupled cluster theory through complementary approaches. The Crawford group will be extending their recent collaborative work on the development of a ""diagrammatic"" stochastic coupled cluster approach that exhibits a hundred-fold reduction in the memory costs for the solution of high-accuracy coupled cluster methods (through quadruple excitations) to take advantage of their newly developed methods for reducing the dimensionality of the underlying correlated wave functions. In addition, following their demonstration that the introduction of a time-dependent external electric field yields substantially greater wave function sparsity than that of the field-perturbed wave function, the Crawford team will develop a locally correlated real-time coupled cluster approach that is designed to take advantage of existing linear-scaling frameworks. Finally, they will develop and implement the first simulations of vibrational circular dichroism spectroscopy using advanced correlated wavefunctions. Development of these new models will involve close collaborations with both experimentalists and theorists, a hallmark of studies in the Crawford laboratory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A prominent feature of the research is that it will enable the generation of products in a so-called 'optically active form' in which one 'enantiomeric configuration' (approximately equivalent to the concept of handedness) of the molecule predominates. The broader impacts of the project will extend to providing hands-on training for students, preparing them for the modern workforce. In addition, public outreach in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) will be achieved through an educational event called ""Chemistry Day at the Mall, Molecular Mania."" This event is popular with children and fosters interactions with the public, in general. Many visitors with diverse socioeconomic backgrounds participate.<br/><br/>Palladium-catalyzed reactions of olefins have long been recognized as excellent starting points for the preparation of feedstock and fine chemicals. Many such transformations involve a nucleopalladation reaction; however, subtle changes in reaction parameters impact reaction mechanism making it difficult to design reliable enantioselective processes. The funded project specifically addresses challenges in carbofunctionalization by the utilization of Pd(II)?StackPhos complexes in enantioselective endo-1,2-alkene difunctionalization reactions. Herein, the catalyst controls the stereochemical configuration of products by recognizing a specific olefin pi-face, leading to net enantioselective olefin functionalization reactions. A key goal of the research is to identify catalysts that exhibit high levels of stereoselectivity for both syn- and anti-addition reactions. Mechanistic probes will be used to glean information in regard to the mode of addition. Further studies are aimed at carbocycle-forming reactions, primarily through the endo-mode cyclization and complementing the more highly developed exo-mode cyclizations currently available. Additional work will expand on the kinds of transformations hitherto investigated to encompass alternative substrates that may also lead to useful enantioenriched products. Successful realization of the goals of the funded project will have a significant impact on the field of transition metal-mediated catalysis by providing a fundamental understanding of the factors necessary for enantioselective endo-1,2-difunctionalization reactions. It is anticipated that the findings will enable widespread deployment of this strategy across a range of synthetic applications in both academic and industrial laboratories.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The industrial preparation of many pharmaceuticals, plastics, dyes and electronic materials involves the precise breaking and forming of chemical bonds.  Performing these bond activations is challenging and a diverse range of catalysts have been developed to perform them. Many of these catalysts require compounds of scarce, precious metals such as palladium, rhodium, iridium, and gold. However, their use is becoming increasingly problematic due to concerns around cost, abundance, and sustainability. Relevant to this challenge, this project is directed toward developing reactive bond-breaking and forming systems that do not contain metals. The project is focused on metal-free systems featuring carborane clusters, which are compounds of less toxic, earth-abundant, and inexpensive elements ? boron, carbon, phosphorus, and hydrogen. The project is directed toward expanding fundamental knowledge of main group element chemistry and reactivity patterns involved in sustainable chemical transformations. The project involves increased participation of pre-college and undergraduate students in research and chemistry, especially those from demographics typically underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields, including from Historically Black Colleges and Universities, such as Claflin University, the oldest HBCU in South Carolina.<br/><br/>The main focus of this project is the synthesis of metal-free carborane frameworks that have the ability to donate and accept electrons through donor sites and to cycle through two-electron redox states. The chemical properties of these redox-active carboranyl clusters are utilized to enable bond activation reactions.  The ability of the bis(phosphino)-closo-carborane cage to accept two electrons and become a dianionic open nido-cluster while breaking a bond in a substrate and the two phosphines converting to phosphonium cations will be studied. The overall reactivity may be described as the oxidative addition of a substrate to the whole carboranyl diphosphine molecule. This work will endeavor to establish the design principles for enhancing reactivity based on electrochemical data, structural and spectroscopical parameters, and computation. In order to establish the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters for bond activation reactions promoted by these cluster compounds, studies of the transfer of electrons and protons in the metal-free reduction of unsaturated carbonyl compounds will be conducted.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Harmonic analysis has played major roles in pure and applied sciences since Fourier's work on the theory of heat diffusion, continuing with the success of Schrdinger?s equation in quantum mechanics. It underlies a diverse array of tools widely used in sciences and engineering and offers the promise of further applications in the future. The research is to deal with foundational issues, which may help to underpin future applications. In PDE, the focus will be to study long-time dynamical properties, such as decay and smoothing of dispersive PDE including several fundamental equations describing diverse physical phenomena. In particular, the Dirac equation is a model for graphene, which has important applications in science and engineering. The fourth order Schrdinger equation was introduced to model the propagation of intense laser beams in a bulk medium with Kerr nonlinearity; in addition it is useful in the study of interaction of water waves. In harmonic analysis, the focus lies on questions in Euclidean spaces centered around Lebesgue norm inequalities. One subject of on-going research is the Fourier restriction phenomenon and its applications on questions in PDE and geometric measure theory. The project will involve undergraduate students in research activities through numerical projects in Illinois Geometry Lab and the mentoring of graduate students.<br/> <br/>More specifically, the research is to encompass dispersive decay and smoothing estimates and the boundedness of wave operators for dispersive PDE such as higher order Schrdinger?s equations and Dirac equations, and to study applications to the regularity properties and long-time dynamics of the nonlinear counterparts. The methods involved will include the spectral theory of self-adjoint operators and oscillatory integral estimates in Fourier analysis. Another area of research is on the fractal dimension of solution graphs of dispersive PDE, or the Talbot effect. Previously, these questions were studied in the case of periodic boundary conditions using exponential sum estimates and smoothing estimates for nonlinear equations; as part of this project, more general geometries such as the sphere and tori in higher dimensions will be investigated. In harmonic analysis the project will entail weighted restriction estimates partly relying on recent developments in decoupling theory, as well as the applications of weighted restriction estimates on questions in geometric measure theory and in dispersive PDE such as the Schrdinger?s equation with a fractal measure as potential.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These devices are used in many aspects of modern life such as telecommunication, energy, consumer electronics, and solid-state lighting. Most commonly the active material in optoelectronic devices are Gallium Nitride (GaN) or Aluminum Nitride (AlN). These materials have attracted significant attention and are of great interest because of their emission in ultraviolet (UV) and visible wavelengths. Nanostructures of nitride materials are not as common as planar structures which are currently used in commercial devices, but they could enable future devices with novel functionalities. With this award from the LEAPS-MPS program researchers at Illinois State University develop nanopatterns of AlN and GaN by using a synthesis approach called Sequential Infiltration Synthesis (SIS). SIS allows them to investigate the growth mechanism of the nitride materials as well as optical properties of nanostructures with different shapes morphologies. In addition to this research being of great interest to the semiconductor industry, the project also enhances the undergraduate education at a primarily undergraduate institution because students can participate in cutting-edge experimental research, which provides hands-on synthesis and characterization opportunities. This effort also broadens the semiconductor workforce by integrating research results into the physics curriculum as part of an upper-level experimental physics courses. The recipient of this award, an early career female faculty member is a role model for female and minority students, encouraging them to choose STEM careers.<br/> <br/>Technical Summary:<br/>In the field of optoelectronic research, group III nitrides such as AlN and GaN have gained significant attention over last few decades due to their stabilities and as a wide band gap semiconductor with emission in the ultraviolet and visible ranges. The planar structured nitride materials currently used in commercial devices come with limitations such as defects and dislocations due to lattice mismatch with available substrates which consequently limit the performance of the resulting devices, high temperature requirements limiting choice of substrates and the dimensions are not suitable for futuristic nanoscale devices. For emerging devices, the concerns related to planar structures can be alleviated by employing nanostructures of these materials. However, fabrication methods of nanostructured nitride materials are still in infancy and current approaches are complex and multi-step processes. Significant improvements and a fundamental understanding are needed regarding the growth of nitride nanostructures and subsequent long-range patterning of these nanostructures. With this award from the LEAPS-MPS program the researchers synthesize AlN and GaN nanorod patterns using nanostructured block copolymer (BCP) templates and an inorganic deposition method called Sequential Infiltration Synthesis (SIS). The SIS process involves infiltration of gas phase molecules into soft polymeric materials. This project investigates the SIS growth mechanism for nitride materials using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy (FTIR) as well as other physical, structural and optical characterization techniques. These and other methods, including scanning electron microscopy (SEM), energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy (EDX), X-ray diffraction (XRD), photoluminescence (PL) and photoluminescence excitation (PLE) spectroscopy, and cathodoluminescence (CL) imaging, are used to study the resulting nanostructures. The proposed work opens up new avenues of research to realize nitride nanomaterial growth and patterning using SIS as a facile and cost-effective method.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One hundred eighty elementary teachers situated in small, rural school districts will be recruited for the study, bringing together 45 teachers from four states: North Dakota, California, Montana, and Wyoming. The teachers will participate in intensive online PL over the span of 5 days. After completing the initial PL, teachers will engage in modest electronic supports including a half-day refresher session the year after the initial PL, virtual meetings, social media connections among participating teachers, and access to archived Webinars on a range of topics related to teaching elementary school science. Modest support for replacement of consumable supplies needed for hands-on classroom engineering tasks will also be provided. The project will examine the extent to which these modest supports individually and collectively foster the sustainability of PL outcomes in terms of increases in instructional time devoted to science, teacher self-efficacy in science, and teacher use of reform-oriented instructional strategies aligned with the Next Generation Science Standards. The effects of contextual factors on sustainability of PL outcomes will also be investigated.<br/><br/>This longitudinal study will address four research objectives: (1) assessing the extent to which an intense 5-day science and engineering PL event impacts teachers? knowledge and self-efficacy in science; (2) observing the effectiveness of modest supports on teachers? self-efficacy in science and engineering, on teachers? use of inquiry-based instructional strategies, and on the sustainability of PL outcomes, including instructional time in science and engineering; (3) documenting the effectiveness of intense PL, followed by modest supports, on teachers? capacities to deliver engineering instruction, and specifically their integration of engineering practices; and (4) capturing the outcomes of science and engineering instruction delivered by teachers after intense PL and modest supports, as shown by student achievement.

The PD uses an approach that engages teachers with web-based apps that allow them to test and experiment with their mathematical ideas. The apps, combined with guiding questions that challenge teachers? thinking about fractions and proportions, serve both to promote critical thinking about the concepts and to further developing their understandings of the concepts. The researchers will use an innovative approach, topic modeling, to examine the effectiveness of each of version of the PD. Topic modeling will allow the researchers to identify patterns in the language teachers use as they participate in the PD, and subsequently, to better understand the development of the understanding teachers develop. The project has promise to not only enhance teachers? instruction on topics with which students have traditionally struggled, but also to demonstrate the viability of Topic Models as a means to measure learning using natural language?an approach that could potentially replace large-scale, multiple-choice tests as a measure of student learning with learning activities in the classroom. <br/><br/>The project uses a design-based research approach to focus on three main goals: expansion of a pilot PD model to include fractions and proportions; testing of a conjecture about the PD model focused on supporting teachers in making connections between learning content in novel ways to developing pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) from their experiences; and implementing topic modeling as an assessment model for measuring changes in teachers? participation in the PD. Topic models will be used as the primary assessment, rather than pencil and paper assessments, because of their alignment to the content and the PD approach, which is highly interactive and focused on conjecture testing. The use of topic modeling opens an opportunity for qualitative data to be used as an assessment tool rather than relying on assessment instruments that may not be aligned to the instruction. Proposed outcomes of this work include: a pool of mathematical tasks for teachers that support playful engagement with important mathematical ideas; a guide outlining a coherent 30-hour experience for teachers that engages in developing both content knowledge and PCK related to fractions, ratios, and proportions; evidence of the PD program?s effectiveness that relies on topic modeling to measure change in teachers? participation and learning in the workshops; data on two different approaches to supporting teachers in linking content knowledge development to PCK development; and a coding framework that defines ?robust? understanding of fractions related to referent units and invariance. All aspects of the PD will be grounded in the use of dynamic, web-based ?toys? (apps) that have been designed to support the development of robust understandings of proportion and fraction concepts. Contributions to the field include the PD model, the robust understandings framework, and findings specific to the use of topic models. One such contribution will be further insight into the sample size necessary to use topic models for assessment, which will help the field better understand how to use this quantitative approach with relatively small qualitative data sets. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

While the nutrients underneath glaciers are known to be important for nearby biological communities, comparatively less is known about the chemistry and importance of glacier surfaces and snowpack, which can trap dust -  small particles of rock that are deposited by wind and with snowfall. The dust is darker than ice and snow and therefore can warm during sunny periods and melt the surrounding frozen water, generating small amounts of liquid water. During cloudy and cold periods, solar radiation can no longer heat the particles and the liquid water around the dust freezes again. These thawing and freezing cycles can break down the dust and release nutrients, such as iron, which can potentially be used by organisms in the ice or can be transported to streams, lakes, and/or the ocean during periods of high melt. This research will combine computer modeling and laboratory experiments to understand 1) what happens (chemically and physically) to glacier and snowpack dust during freezing and thawing and 2) how to model freezing and thawing of water and dust in glacier ice. Two traveling exhibits exploring the connections between science and art will result from this project, allowing for diverse audiences to connect with the Antarctic continent and understand how small-scale science influences large-scale systems. The results of this study will determine the geochemistry of glacial meltwater due to freezing and thawing, and whether the meltwater contains critical nutrients for surrounding ecosystems.<br/><br/>Despite low temperatures and the relative scarcity of liquid water, glacial systems can be a major source of trace metals, nutrients and other weathering products to proglacial and marine systems. While the importance of weathering has been established in subglacial and proglacial environments, less is understood about weathering mechanisms or the composition of major and trace nutrients at the most upstream source: within snow and supraglacial ice. Wind deposits fine-grained sediment on ice surfaces, which can then melt or become incorporated into the ice profile and experience a range of thermal regimes and freeze-thaw conditions. Daily freeze-thaw cycling drives physical and chemical weathering of sediment grains, yet few studies have explicitly examined the frequency and intensity of freeze-thaw cycles and how they control major ion and trace metal release, alteration, and mobility. This interdisciplinary study will use geochemical and energy balance modeling, freeze-thaw experimentation, and scanning electron microscopy to advance knowledge of mineral weathering in ice and snow active layers. Existing samples collected from the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, an ecosystem that relies on runoff derived from supraglacial ice and snow melt, will be utilized. Two traveling exhibits exploring the connections between science and art will result from this project, the first focused on connecting the macro-scale Antarctic continent to micro-scale microscopy images, and the second a contemporary art exhibit that will explore the Antarctic continent and our perceptions of scale. Findings from this research will contribute to knowledge of nutrient bioavailability and delivery to proglacial environments and polar oceans, watershed-scale weathering in glacial systems, and the conditions that create microsites for life on glaciers and other icy systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The majority of respiration research has focused heavily on respiration rate and blood oxygen saturation. Despite being well-known, these are only a subset of respiration parameters. Beyond that, blood oxygen and carbon dioxide partial pressures - called blood gases - have medical significance and the potential of being measured noninvasively. This research specifically addresses a serious and global problem, respiration disorders of infants. Respiratory distress is one of the most common reasons for infant admission to the neonatal intensive care unit. Studies have shown that after successful medical treatment in the neonatal intensive care unit, earlier discharge to a home life with remote monitoring infrastructures could improve the survival chances of these at-risk infants. Monitoring patients with respiratory disorders from a home setting could enhance the health and well-being of individuals of all ages, from neonatal patients with developing lungs to adults with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), while creating and bringing new large data sets to the attention of clinicians. Currently, conventional blood gas monitors employed in corded-bedside equipment can find place in clinical settings. However, a wireless miniaturized blood gas monitoring system supported with computational models can extend the use beyond the hospital for long-term care. Besides these potential benefits to society, this project advances hardware-software co-design for wireless wearable sensors. Miniaturized blood gas research offers unique research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students to understand technical details of different disciplines and develop translational biomedical skills. The interdisciplinary team provides opportunities for underrepresented students to encourage them to pursue careers in research and STEM. The curriculum development allows to introduce interdisciplinary topics and hands-on experimental experiences to students.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop a hardware-software integration framework for a miniaturized, noninvasive, wireless, luminescence-based oxygen sensing wearable device with an open-source software toolkit.  The toolkit accurately translates the blood oxygen levels by utilizing measured transcutaneous oxygen diffused through the skin. Within this framework, computational models of oxygen transport is used to iteratively design an estimation algorithm for the intelligent sensor. This sensor is resilient to noise arising from intra- and interpersonal variations, environmental factors, and sensor hardware operations.  The core scientific contributions include 1) the presentation of computational models of oxygen transport incorporating factors affecting sensor readings such as weight, age, gender, sensor degradation, for building an estimation engine, for the first time in literature; 2) the creation of a novel miniaturized custom-designed wearable that measures transcutaneous oxygen; 3) the integration of hardware and software on a flexible miniaturized wearable device for long-term comfortable wear; 4) the determination of the computational models? accuracy, the sensitivity of overall system, and the specificity of the sensor by capturing the dynamic respiratory physiological status of individuals with longitudinal data. The developed hardware-software platform is validated on humans. Having the ability of sensing vital blood oxygen parameter with a wearable supported with computational models is unique, filling an important gap in the miniaturization of the transcutaneous blood gas sensor for noninvasive wearable device applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Symbiotic stars are a type of interacting binary system consisting of a red giant that donates material to a white dwarf or neutron star companion via winds and/or Roche-lobe overflow. They offer important insights into stellar evolution in binary systems and the formation of binaries containing neutron stars and/or black holes, and are believed to contribute a not- insignificant fraction of Type Ia supernovae, which currently provide our best means of measuring cosmic distances and the acceleration of the universe. Determining the method and rate of mass transfer is key to answering questions about their evolution and role as Type Ia progenitors. The principal investigator (PI) will lead a team of students using optical interferometry to measure precise shapes and radii of the red giant stars in a sample of known symbiotic stars to observe the transfer of mass to the white dwarf/neutron star companion. Few interferometric studies of symbiotic stars have been done to date, and the proposed work promises to make a significant contribution to the field by systematically obtaining some of the highest resolution images of any star (apart from the sun) over a multi-year timeline. The project will provide material for a Master?s Thesis and research mentoring for underserved student populations and will support outreach initiatives to local schools.<br/><br/>The PI will use the MIRC-X (H-band and J-band), MYSTIC (K-band), and SPICA (optical) combiners on the Center for High Angular Resolution Astronomy (CHARA) Array to collect optical interferometric data for image reconstruction of these systems. In order to look for evidence of mass transfer, they will need to observe these systems at different orbital positions. As a result, these data will be collected regularly over the course of the grant, with cadence depending on the orbital parameters of each system. Systems with primary stars of angular diameter greater than 2 milli-arcseconds will be used to facilitate imaging and search for elongation due to Roche-lobe overflow. In order to determine the fundamental parameters of the primary and identify the presence of dust, facilities such as SpeX on the NASA InfraRed Telescope Facility (IRTF) will be used to obtain near-infrared spectroscopy. The proposal will use advances in image reconstruction to improve the quality of images produced using the data. New modelling techniques will also be developed to search for elongation and disk formation in the systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of this CAREER project is to uncover the dynamic changes in the extracellular biomolecular environment that support lung tissue maturation during development and during surgical resection induced regeneration. This information will then be used to guide the engineering of novel extracellular biomaterials to enable directed lung tissue maturation in the laboratory setting from human induced pluripotent stem cells (hiPSCs). By identifying and validating the essential extracellular factors, this project will lay the foundation for deriving functional human lung tissues to help patients suffering from end-stage lung diseases and will inspire novel therapeutics promoting lung repair and regeneration following injuries. The research efforts of the CAREER project are integrated with educational and outreach objectives to promote active learning and automated student behavior analysis in the biomedical engineering classroom, to develop an outreach program to encourage and inspire local high school students by hosting educational poster sessions, and to promote biomedical engineering research and education towards the general public through collaboration with a local museum focusing on biological arts.<br/><br/>The investigator's long-term research goal is to engineer lung tissues that meet unique physiological and functional requirements.  Towards this goal, the objective of this CAREER project is to catalog the dynamic synthesis and secretion of extracellular matrix (ECM) glycoproteins over native lung alveologenesis and use this information to instruct the induction of alveolar cells and tissues from hiPSCs. Emerging evidence suggests that the developmentally regulated ECM deposition is pivotal to the maturation of alveolar cells and proper lung tissue morphogenesis. However, a comprehensive survey of de novo ECM synthesis throughout lung development and regeneration has been challenging to obtain, due to the limited sensitivity in detecting the production of new ECM proteins. To address this bottleneck, this research will develop and implement a novel newly synthesized ECM (newsECM) profiling approach for uncovering the dynamic ECM synthetic programs accompanying alveologenesis. This strategy, by selective labeling and enrichment of newsECM proteins free from the bulk pre-existing ECM, will enable ultrasensitive identification of new ECM synthesis with unprecedented daily temporal resolution. This addresses the critical limitation of current ECM proteomics and is well suited for studying highly dynamic processes such as alveologenesis. Building on this technological innovation, this CAREER project will (1) decode the dynamic ECM production during native lung alveologenesis (neonatal and adult post-pneumonectomy), and (2) engineer hiPSC-derived alveologenesis using developmentally inspired ECM scaffolds. Achieving directed alveolar specification from hiPSCs will provide fundamental insights regarding lung development and facilitate the generation of patient-specific lung tissues for drug discovery and regenerative medicine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Physics-based approaches reliably capture the processes that govern conformational changes of protein molecules, but typically do so at great computational expense. A recently developed modeling paradigm, which describes protein molecules in terms of large numbers of rigid nano-linkages that fold under the influence of interatomic forces, can significantly reduce the computational burden, but presents challenges with ensuring that the predicted folding and unfolding pathways are realistic and not artificially driven by the numerical algorithm. In this project, this challenge is overcome using an optimization-based control theoretic framework to guide both folding and unfolding dynamics while respecting biologically realistic rates of change of conformational entropy. Knowledge gained from the development of this framework will enable systematic investigation of protein conformational dynamics, including unfolding pathways of coronavirus spike proteins, while also advancing previously unexplored control tools that may help robots navigate cluttered environments. A unique approach to sonification of protein pathway data will make this knowledge broadly accessible and will be integrated in course projects for undergraduate students in engineering, computer science, and art, as well as in research activities aiming to mentor high school students in STEM.<br/><br/>This research aims to bridge the two seemingly unrelated fields of optimization-based nonlinear control and conformational dynamics of proteins through rigorous development and investigation of computationally efficient and numerically stable algorithms that accurately predict protein folding and unfolding while avoiding pathways associated with artificially rapid loss of conformational entropy. This project will fill the critical gap in knowledge of encoding entropy-loss constraints using the kinetostatic compliance method by developing a novel non-iterative, large-scale, quadratic programming-based control scheme over hyper-ellipsoids for protein folding dynamics with large state-space dimensions; constructing a large-scale, variable-step-size, numerical integration algorithm that is expected to reduce the number of integration steps, where each step requires the burdensome computation of a very large interatomic force vector field; and developing a control theoretic approach for systematically investigating the problem of protein unfolding. Ground truth data for validation will be obtained from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and, in the case of the model protein barnase, publicly available experimental data from optical tweezer-based mechanical unfolding experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The MJO has worldwide impacts, modulating the number of hurricanes that form in the Gulf of Mexico, the rainy seasons of Asia, Australia, Africa, and the Americas, and the formation of the atmospheric rivers that cause flooding along the US West Coast.<br/> <br/>One issue that has gained prominence in recent years is how the MJO is influenced by the winds in the stratosphere above it.  In the tropics the stratospheric wind blow from east to west or vice versa, changing direction over the course of about two years.  The wind reversal starts at the top and descends in a progression known as the Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO).  Observations since 1980 show that the MJO is more robust in the easterly phase of the QBO (when the wind in the lower stratosphere is from the east) than in the westerly phase, a relationship which holds during the northern winter.  The MJO is also more predictable in the easterly phase, thus the modulation of the MJO by the QBO has implications for subseasonal prediction.<br/><br/>Work performed here seeks to understand why the MJO is sensitive to the phase of the QBO.  Two possibilities are explored, the first being that the MJO is damped by the upward propagation of wave energy into the stratosphere. The work is an extension of earlier research by the Principal Investigator (PI) showing how the energy of convectively coupled equatorial waves can be lost through upward propagation.  The second possibility is that the wind of the QBO influences the cirrus clouds that form at the tropopause level above convection in the MJO.  Cirrus clouds are effective at trapping outgoing longwave radiation, and their radiative effect is thought to be important for creating the large areas of convective clouds found in the MJO.  The QBO could affect the cirrus clouds either directly, as the QBO wind moves the clouds in one direction or the other, or indirectly through modulating the rising motions that favor cirrus clouds.  The research is conducted through the development of an idealized theoretical model that captures the hypothesized effects and through simulations using a state-of-the art atmospheric model, the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM).<br/><br/>The work has societal value due to the worldwide weather and climate effects of the MJO. The modulation of the MJO by the QBO has clear implications for subseasonal prediction, as noted above, but the reasons for the modulation are not known and the extent to which it can be harnessed for better predictions is difficult to assess.  In addition, the Principal Investigator serves as a mentor to undergraduate and graduate students and participates in outreach activities such as the Lamont Open House.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time, such complex systems are subject to an abundance of influences, and depend on a large variety of parameters and interactions. In addition, for many complex phenomena most of the available information is very often ""statistical"" (random) and not ""exact"" (deterministic). A systematic understanding of the interplay of stochasticity and complex dynamical behavior aims at unveiling universal properties, irrespectively of the many details of the concrete systems at hand. Its development relies on the derivation and analysis of universal concepts for their scaling limits, capturing not only their average behavior, but also their fluctuations. Stochastic partial differential equations are the natural mathematical object to study and understand the role of fluctuations. Another very current and important issue arising in science and technology is the analysis, both theoretically and computationally, of problems that involve several disparate length-scales at once. For example, understanding, modeling and accurately predicting the behavior of materials at the macroscopic scale necessitates to consider their microscopic structure. Instead of considering materials in one scale and neglecting the finer scales, modern materials science increasingly explicitly and concurrently deals with models of a given material at many different scales. Homogenization and multiscale approaches are the two, respectively theoretical and computational, facets of the mathematical theory to study such problems. As a matter of fact, it is necessary to consider homogenization in random environments since periodicity is rather restrictive for the modeling of real materials. Growth models are natural mathematical models used in probability and mathematical physics to study stochastic partial differential equations exhibiting a universal scaling limit. Mean-field games are the ideal mathematical structures to study the quintessential problems in the social-economic sciences, which differ from physical settings because of the forward looking behavior on the part of individual agents. In this context, an agent aims to optimize certain criteria which, together with her/his dynamics, depend on the other agents and their actions. Agents react, anticipate and strategize instead of simply reacting instantaneously. Examples of applications include the modeling of the macro-economy and conflicts in the modern era. In both cases, a large number of agents interact strategically in a stochastically evolving environment, all responding to partly common and partly idiosyncratic incentives, and all trying to simultaneously forecast the dynamic decisions of others. Some mean-field games models in, for example, telecommunications are naturally set on networks (graphs). This raises the need of the development of the mathematical tools to study equations on graphs and to understand their behavior across nodes. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The project is a continuation of the PI's program to develop novel methodologies and techniques for the qualitative and quantitative study of nonlinear first- and second-order deterministic and stochastic partial differential equations (PDEs and SPDEs, respectively) arising in natural and social sciences and engineering. The emphasis is on (i) PDEs with multiplicative ``rough'' path dependence; (ii) homogenization in random media; (iii) well-posedness in domains with singularities; (iv) mean-field games; and (v) convergence of growth models. Nonlinear, first- and second-order partial differential equations with rough and, in particular, stochastic time dependence arise naturally in the study of fluctuations. The further development of the theory of pathwise solutions is important, for it allows to study of new classes of nonlinear SPDEs, and is expected to play a crucial role in applied areas by providing the tools to analyze previously intractable models. Studying qualitatively and quantitatively stochastic homogenization problems requires the development of novel arguments and methodologies to address the loss of compactness when going from periodic to stationary ergodic media. The analysis of the behavior of scaled growth models gives rise to new equations. Their well-posedness requires the refinement of some of the by now classical tools from the theory of viscosity solutions. It is by now well understood that a very important element of the mean-field game theory is the so-called master equation, an infinite-dimensional partial differential equation which subsumes in a single equation both the individual and collective behaviors of agents. In spite of considerable progress in the study of the properties of the smooth solution of the master equation in the presence of both idiosyncratic and common noises, less is known in the absence of the former in which case smooth solutions do not exist in general. Another important question in this context is the development of a notion of weak solution in the relevant for application nonmonotone setting. Two of the most important questions in the study of equations of graphs is the well-posedness across vertices and the identification of the correct coupling condition.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Shortwave infrared waves are invisible to the human eye but can be detected by special cameras. A major advantage of these waves is that they can pass through tissue and be used for imaging in complex organisms.  Additional opportunities are also seen in improving long-haul telecommunications of fiber optical networks.

These photophysical properties will then be amplified several orders of magnitude through self-assembly in solution yielding exceptionally red-shifted aggregates.  To aid in experimental design and speed discovery, computational modelling will be used to correlate the structure of these aggregates with their electronic properties.  The research activities associated with this award will increase broadening participation and enable training of high school, undergraduate, and graduate students in synthetic organic chemistry and spectroscopy.

This international research experience will enable students to develop skills in diverse research methods and to build teamwork, problem-solving, and cross-cultural communication skills critical for becoming globally competent scientists and professionals. The inherent collaborative nature of this project means that there will be direct contributions to the capacity building of faculty, students, and park staff in Indonesia as well, via expanded research skills and dissemination of research findings to international audiences. The project results will also help inform forest management policy, the development of mitigation efforts aimed at minimizing the frequency and intensity of human-primate interactions, and conservation outreach programs focused on expanding people?s awareness of the threats to Sulawesi?s endemic flora and fauna. Ultimately, this project will showcase the value of interdisciplinary research and international collaboration in addressing today?s grand challenges and produce a cadre of STEM students who are globally engaged scientists and professionals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The primary source of water vapor in the lower stratosphere comes from the tropics, where year-round heating of the ocean surface by the sun fuels some of the world's most intense storms. Tropical thunderstorms loft water vapor into the upper troposphere. Whatever water vapor that is not freeze-dried at the cold point tropopause ? the thermal boundary between the troposphere and the stratosphere ? is free to enter the stratosphere, where it is distributed globally. However, most water vapor does not enter the stratosphere immediately above these storms, as this is also where the tropopause is coldest. Furthermore, the strongest storms do not necessarily occur over the warmest ocean surface. Leveraging the newly available high-resolution observations and a hierarchy of climate models, this project aims to better understand these issues involved in getting water vapor into the stratosphere. In collaboration with scientists at the National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCAR), the proposed activities will train a graduate student and involve the education programs at the investigator?s institution.<br/><br/>This work will rely on state-of-the-art reanalyses, a hierarchy of numerical models, and the new COSMIC-II (Constellation Observing System for Meteorology Ionosphere and Climate II) fleet of global positioning system receivers to (1) examine how sea surface temperatures impact cold point tropopause (CPT) temperatures, (2) analyze the processes in the atmosphere that determine CPT temperature, and (3) determine when and where the CPT temperature matters most for stratospheric moisture uptake. The investigating team will first observe the relationships between sea surface temperature, CPT temperatures, and water vapor, then compare the observed relationships with those in model simulations. The team will also utilize numerical models to examine the impacts of resolution and sea surface temperature anomalies on CPT temperatures. In addition to being of interests to the climate science community, the emerging results on stratospheric change has implications for health and prosperity, as well as national defense (which was the original motivation for the study of stratospheric moisture and circulation during WWII).

The plate boundary setting of Guatemala exposes the country to numerous natural hazards including earthquakes from four source areas, volcanic eruptions along the active Central American Volcanic Arc, and landslides and floods that have intensified by more frequent tropical storms and hurricanes in a warming Earth. The Guatemala Geohazards IRES project has the potential of increasing both the number of women and under-represented minorities conducting research, completing a bachelor's degree, and continuing to graduate programs and careers in geosciences. Our IRES also brings diversity to the face of our role models with six Hispanic mentors and three women faculty mentors.

Raman spectroscopy is an important tool for the investigation of a diverse array of molecular systems. Effective use of this tool requires a clear and deep understanding of the vibrations within molecules that are associated with the absorption of light with specific amounts of energy. Alkynes, molecules with carbon-carbon triple bonds, have recently been used in Raman spectroscopy to understand the structure and dynamics of proteins that cells use to make new molecules. This new use of alkynes highlights the need to more deeply understand alkyne vibrations and thus their Raman spectroscopic signals. In this project, funded by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and housed in the Chemistry Division, Professor Clyde Daly and his students at Haverford College will develop relationships called ?spectroscopic maps? between the Raman absorption of alkyne molecules and their molecular environments. These maps can be used in molecular simulations to better understand how cells make new molecules, relevant to the design of new drugs and materials. This project will also advance computational and experimental uses of Raman spectroscopy.  The methods developed during this project will be used to build educational materials for advanced and first year courses related to vibrational spectroscopy.  Engagement in the research of students from backgrounds underrepresented in Mathematical and Physical Sciences fields will be prioritized through avenues such as payment for work-study (disproportionately low-income or first-generation college students) and recruitment of students from disadvantaged backgrounds.<br/><br/>This project will engage undergraduate students in the development of a vibrational spectroscopic map for terminal alkyne containing molecules at Haverford College. The carbon-carbon triple bond stretching vibration of terminal alkynes has been increasingly used as a Raman vibrational probe to understand proteins, other biological molecules, and materials. A spectroscopic map will enable the calculation of Raman spectra from molecular dynamics simulations. The process of building the spectroscopic map will also uncover the reasons for the substantial Raman frequency shift of the vibration of interest between different solvation environments. The aims for this project are threefold: (1) create a spectroscopic map that is appropriate for answering biophysical questions related to the acyl carrier protein relevant to our collaborators; (2) advance the paradigm of spectroscopic map design to include machine learning more fully as a tool and universality as a goal; (3) understand the factors that lead to Raman frequency shifts in terminal alkynes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the nutrients underneath glaciers are known to be important for nearby biological communities, comparatively less is known about the chemistry and importance of glacier surfaces and snowpack, which can trap dust -  small particles of rock that are deposited by wind and with snowfall. The dust is darker than ice and snow and therefore can warm during sunny periods and melt the surrounding frozen water, generating small amounts of liquid water. During cloudy and cold periods, solar radiation can no longer heat the particles and the liquid water around the dust freezes again. These thawing and freezing cycles can break down the dust and release nutrients, such as iron, which can potentially be used by organisms in the ice or can be transported to streams, lakes, and/or the ocean during periods of high melt. This research will combine computer modeling and laboratory experiments to understand 1) what happens (chemically and physically) to glacier and snowpack dust during freezing and thawing and 2) how to model freezing and thawing of water and dust in glacier ice. Two traveling exhibits exploring the connections between science and art will result from this project, allowing for diverse audiences to connect with the Antarctic continent and understand how small-scale science influences large-scale systems. The results of this study will determine the geochemistry of glacial meltwater due to freezing and thawing, and whether the meltwater contains critical nutrients for surrounding ecosystems.<br/><br/>Despite low temperatures and the relative scarcity of liquid water, glacial systems can be a major source of trace metals, nutrients and other weathering products to proglacial and marine systems. While the importance of weathering has been established in subglacial and proglacial environments, less is understood about weathering mechanisms or the composition of major and trace nutrients at the most upstream source: within snow and supraglacial ice. Wind deposits fine-grained sediment on ice surfaces, which can then melt or become incorporated into the ice profile and experience a range of thermal regimes and freeze-thaw conditions. Daily freeze-thaw cycling drives physical and chemical weathering of sediment grains, yet few studies have explicitly examined the frequency and intensity of freeze-thaw cycles and how they control major ion and trace metal release, alteration, and mobility. This interdisciplinary study will use geochemical and energy balance modeling, freeze-thaw experimentation, and scanning electron microscopy to advance knowledge of mineral weathering in ice and snow active layers. Existing samples collected from the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, an ecosystem that relies on runoff derived from supraglacial ice and snow melt, will be utilized. Two traveling exhibits exploring the connections between science and art will result from this project, the first focused on connecting the macro-scale Antarctic continent to micro-scale microscopy images, and the second a contemporary art exhibit that will explore the Antarctic continent and our perceptions of scale. Findings from this research will contribute to knowledge of nutrient bioavailability and delivery to proglacial environments and polar oceans, watershed-scale weathering in glacial systems, and the conditions that create microsites for life on glaciers and other icy systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These studies rely on accurate dating of features left behind by the past ice sheets.  The most commonly used method for determining the age of these features over the last ~40,000 years is radiocarbon dating.  However, radiocarbon dating is not without its nuances, which are particularly pronounced around Antarctica.  One of these nuances is determining the offset between the materials measured radiocarbon age and its true age.  The purpose of this research is to use historically harvested whale bones from the Antarctic Peninsula, whose age is independently known, to determine that offset.  A better understanding of that offset will allow more accurate estimates of past rates of ice sheet and sea-level changes across the Antarctic Peninsula over the last ~40,000 years.  <br/><br/>Much of our understanding of how the Antarctic Ice Sheet will respond to future climate changes is based on studies of its past behavior.  Those studies often rely on reconstructing its evolution since the Last Glacial Maximum, 20,000 years ago.  Radiocarbon dating is the most commonly used method of dating Quaternary deposits for these reconstructions.  However, the use of radiocarbon in Antarctica is hampered by some of the largest and least constrained radiocarbon reservoirs on the planet.  The purpose of this research is to determine the radiocarbon reservoir for whale bones.  This research will leverage an existing collection of 25 whale bones used for prior DNA research to determine the late Holocene radiocarbon reservoir for the Antarctic Peninsula.   The whale bones are from specimens harvested at the turn of the 20th century prior to nuclear testing in the 1950s.  Thus, their radiocarbon age will provide valuable new constraints on the radiocarbon reservoir for shallow waters around Antarctica.  An added benefit of this approach is that given the DNA determination, we will also be able to determine if that radiocarbon reservoir varies across three species of whales, thus testing the common assumption that the radiocarbon reservoir does not vary significantly across different species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Energy, in the form of heat, typically flows through materials through a process called thermal diffusion. However, Professor Rubtsov and his research team previously identified systems where energy deposited in one end of a molecule is rapidly transferred through the molecular backbone to distant locations. This project examines the underlying details of this anomalous transport of energy. A deeper understanding of ballistic energy transport may help scientists design new materials with improved thermal conductivity properties where the direction, speed, and efficiency of energy transport are controlled.

The aim of the proposed research is to understand the chemical and physical origins of the processes of formation, propagation, and detection of the vibrational wavepackets, which represent compact bundles of energy. One focus of the program is to access regimes of efficient wavepacket initiation in longer molecular chains and to explore a variety of conditions for implementing such regimes. Another focus is to investigate how electronic conjugation in oligomeric chains affects the wavepacket initiation, transport speed, and transport efficiency and to explore the ability of altering the energy transport speed and efficiency by changing the degree of the electronic conjugation by external stimuli. These studies target the development of design principles for efficient energy transporters and energy transport switches. The broader impacts of the project include advanced student training, research opportunities for students from groups that are underrepresented in science, and additional educational outreach activities for middle school students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emerging technologies increasingly require new single-crystal materials for definitive studies of fundamental properties, and successful integration of their properties into state-of-art device structures.  A large number of quantum materials that are driven by competing fundamental interactions have yet to be explored and understood. It is these quantum materials that the PI seeks to discover, synthesize, and study. U.S. leadership in Science and Technology requires drastically increasing the number of scientists who possess skills in both the synthesis and characterization of new materials. The current situation presents an urgent national challenge that could ultimately undermine the Nation?s economic competitiveness, if left unaddressed. This project addresses this problem by providing rigorous training of graduate and undergraduate students, who are the future human capital for technologies that drive the economy.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL DESCRIPTION<br/>Novel quantum materials can exhibit surprising or even revolutionary physical properties necessary for critical advances in science and technology. This project focuses on strongly correlated materials with strong spin-orbit interactions that are manifested in strong quantum effects that can be induced by surprisingly weak external stimuli. Recent research dictates the project address the following four topics unique to the high-Z materials: (1) Electric-current control of quantum states. Electric-current control of structural and physical properties is a long-sought but elusive goal of science and technology. The PI?s recent work demonstrates that strong spin-orbit interactions in a distorted Mott insulator is sufficient to realize this important goal. (2) Delicate quantum liquid in un-frustrated trimer lattices and beyond:  Ba3n+1Ir3nO9n+1 (n=1,2,?).  Quantum spin liquids are among the most intensively sought states of matter.  Although theoretically predicted, they have not been experimentally observed. PI?s preliminary work revealed an anomalously strong frustration in the trimer lattice Ba4Ir3O10, and a critical role of Ir3O12 trimers in producing spin entanglement. Single crystals of the trimer series Ba3n+1Ir3nO9n+1 the PI has recently synthesized will provide a new paradigm in the search for novel phases of matter. (3) Loop-current-driven colossal magnetoresistance without magnetic polarization: Magnetic polarization usually reduces electron scattering and electrical resistance in almost all materials and is an essential ingredient of colossal magnetoresistance. The PI most recently discovered Mn3Si2Te6 and Ca3Ru2O7 are surprising exceptions to this rule.  The electrical resistivity drops by up to 9 orders of magnitude, but only when the magnetic polarization is avoided, implicating a new type of electrical transport yet to be explored. (4) Discovery and synthesis of new quantum materials. A successful effort to discover novel phenomena requires a persistent pursuit of new materials, which has been an essential part of the PI?s research. The crystal synthesis effort will focus on materials with comparable spin-orbit interactions and electron correlations. The phenomena to be studied defy conventional precedents and pose far-reaching scientific and technological breakthroughs. The project brings to bear combined assets of proven expertise, comprehensive experimental facilities, and broad collaborations that complement in-house research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Physics-based approaches reliably capture the processes that govern conformational changes of protein molecules, but typically do so at great computational expense. A recently developed modeling paradigm, which describes protein molecules in terms of large numbers of rigid nano-linkages that fold under the influence of interatomic forces, can significantly reduce the computational burden, but presents challenges with ensuring that the predicted folding and unfolding pathways are realistic and not artificially driven by the numerical algorithm. In this project, this challenge is overcome using an optimization-based control theoretic framework to guide both folding and unfolding dynamics while respecting biologically realistic rates of change of conformational entropy. Knowledge gained from the development of this framework will enable systematic investigation of protein conformational dynamics, including unfolding pathways of coronavirus spike proteins, while also advancing previously unexplored control tools that may help robots navigate cluttered environments. A unique approach to sonification of protein pathway data will make this knowledge broadly accessible and will be integrated in course projects for undergraduate students in engineering, computer science, and art, as well as in research activities aiming to mentor high school students in STEM.<br/><br/>This research aims to bridge the two seemingly unrelated fields of optimization-based nonlinear control and conformational dynamics of proteins through rigorous development and investigation of computationally efficient and numerically stable algorithms that accurately predict protein folding and unfolding while avoiding pathways associated with artificially rapid loss of conformational entropy. This project will fill the critical gap in knowledge of encoding entropy-loss constraints using the kinetostatic compliance method by developing a novel non-iterative, large-scale, quadratic programming-based control scheme over hyper-ellipsoids for protein folding dynamics with large state-space dimensions; constructing a large-scale, variable-step-size, numerical integration algorithm that is expected to reduce the number of integration steps, where each step requires the burdensome computation of a very large interatomic force vector field; and developing a control theoretic approach for systematically investigating the problem of protein unfolding. Ground truth data for validation will be obtained from all-atom molecular dynamics simulations and, in the case of the model protein barnase, publicly available experimental data from optical tweezer-based mechanical unfolding experiments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathias Weber and his team will study how charged atoms and molecules (ions) bind to molecules designed to capture them (receptors) in a process called molecular recognition, and how the presence of water molecules changes this recognition process. Ion receptors can be used to measure and control the concentration of ions in numerous chemical contexts, ranging from a group of antibiotics to sensors and materials science. Ion recognition also has impact on important issues regarding food and water sources, such as the safety of public water supplies, or pollution with some types of molecular ions from industrial and agricultural sources.  Professor Weber plans to develop outreach and educational activities related to his scientific studies, including developing simulations for use in teaching advanced undergraduate chemistry topics, which would provide a valuable resource, particularly for students who cannot participate in hands-on activities on campus.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the role of the solvent in receptor-ion interactions, which is one of the most difficult problems for understanding molecular recognition in solutions. The complexity of solutions presents many obstacles to investigating the interplay of ion, receptor, and solvent, from the presence of multiple species in the same sample with similar responses to experimental probes, to the bulk solvent masking key spectroscopic signatures, to the fluctuating number of solvent molecules interacting with the host-guest pair. The charged nature of many ion-receptor complexes allows selective preparation and mass spectrometric isolation of relevant species, including their hydrated clusters, and circumvents the obstacles mentioned above. The Weber group employs cryogenic ion spectroscopy in concert with electrospray ionization mass spectrometry to measure the infrared spectra of ionic complexes consisting of anions and synthetic receptors binding such ions. These spectra and the accompanying quantum chemical calculations will yield information on the structures and intermolecular forces governing molecular recognition of negative ions. Additionally, the Weber group will characterize the interaction of these complexes with water molecules. The knowledge gained in this work will help in developing predictive methods for the design of synthetic ion receptors. The broader impacts from the expected outcome of this work has the potential to change the way scientists think about ion molecular recognition, which is a frontier in chemical science. The development of applications that address the impact of ions in environmental as well as technical scenarios, including the nexus of food and water, can have significant societal impact.

While the nutrients underneath glaciers are known to be important for nearby biological communities, comparatively less is known about the chemistry and importance of glacier surfaces and snowpack, which can trap dust -  small particles of rock that are deposited by wind and with snowfall. The dust is darker than ice and snow and therefore can warm during sunny periods and melt the surrounding frozen water, generating small amounts of liquid water. During cloudy and cold periods, solar radiation can no longer heat the particles and the liquid water around the dust freezes again. These thawing and freezing cycles can break down the dust and release nutrients, such as iron, which can potentially be used by organisms in the ice or can be transported to streams, lakes, and/or the ocean during periods of high melt. This research will combine computer modeling and laboratory experiments to understand 1) what happens (chemically and physically) to glacier and snowpack dust during freezing and thawing and 2) how to model freezing and thawing of water and dust in glacier ice. Two traveling exhibits exploring the connections between science and art will result from this project, allowing for diverse audiences to connect with the Antarctic continent and understand how small-scale science influences large-scale systems. The results of this study will determine the geochemistry of glacial meltwater due to freezing and thawing, and whether the meltwater contains critical nutrients for surrounding ecosystems.<br/><br/>Despite low temperatures and the relative scarcity of liquid water, glacial systems can be a major source of trace metals, nutrients and other weathering products to proglacial and marine systems. While the importance of weathering has been established in subglacial and proglacial environments, less is understood about weathering mechanisms or the composition of major and trace nutrients at the most upstream source: within snow and supraglacial ice. Wind deposits fine-grained sediment on ice surfaces, which can then melt or become incorporated into the ice profile and experience a range of thermal regimes and freeze-thaw conditions. Daily freeze-thaw cycling drives physical and chemical weathering of sediment grains, yet few studies have explicitly examined the frequency and intensity of freeze-thaw cycles and how they control major ion and trace metal release, alteration, and mobility. This interdisciplinary study will use geochemical and energy balance modeling, freeze-thaw experimentation, and scanning electron microscopy to advance knowledge of mineral weathering in ice and snow active layers. Existing samples collected from the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, an ecosystem that relies on runoff derived from supraglacial ice and snow melt, will be utilized. Two traveling exhibits exploring the connections between science and art will result from this project, the first focused on connecting the macro-scale Antarctic continent to micro-scale microscopy images, and the second a contemporary art exhibit that will explore the Antarctic continent and our perceptions of scale. Findings from this research will contribute to knowledge of nutrient bioavailability and delivery to proglacial environments and polar oceans, watershed-scale weathering in glacial systems, and the conditions that create microsites for life on glaciers and other icy systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Designing professional development that leverages teachers? experiences and knowledge is one way to support teachers? professional learning, as it allows teachers to focus on developing skills that are integrated into the particularities of their practice. By collaborating with one another to design and revise lessons, mathematics teachers can support one another?s learning in many ways, including asking questions, suggesting alternatives, and detailing considerations based on their varying professional experiences and knowledge. This project aims to elaborate a structure for practice-oriented, collaborative professional development that increases the capacities for collaborative learning by facilitating teacher-to-teacher interactions within and across cultural contexts. By convening international groups of teachers to design lessons and provide and respond to commentaries on their lesson designs, the project introduces possibilities for surfacing and disrupting common experiences, assumptions, and norms in US mathematics teaching. Specifically, the project will leverage an innovative form of professional development for secondary mathematics teachers called StoryCircles as a context for teacher-to-teacher interaction within and across cultures. StoryCircles is a practice-based form of professional education that gathers teachers to collectively and iteratively design and revise a lesson. The broader impacts of this project lie in the possibility to scale an innovative, practice-based, lesson-centered model of professional development with large numbers of teachers that can be institutionalized at relatively low cost and implemented completely online. <br/><br/>The project will unfold across three interconnected studies that aim to describe and explain how intra- and cross-cultural annotations of lessons, serve to intervene on: (1) the professional development interactions among secondary mathematics teachers engaged in US-based StoryCircles; (2) the set of lesson artifacts constructed by secondary mathematics teachers engaged in US-based StoryCircles; and (3) the professional noticing of secondary mathematics teachers in the US and abroad who were otherwise uninvolved in the lesson?s production. The project will convene eight StoryCircles groups (made up of 6 inservice teachers drawn from the US) who will work together to design algebra and geometry lessons for sharing with other teachers. Each lesson will be reviewed by teams of practicing teachers both in the US and abroad who will leave comments for the authoring team to consider. Once these commentaries are completed, the StoryCircles groups will reconvene to consider the commentaries and make revisions to their lesson storyboards. Project researchers will draw on artifacts collected across the StoryCircles interactions (including video, storyboarded lessons, and lesson commentaries) as well as responses gathered from all project participants to scenario-based surveys to explore aspects of the rationality of mathematics teaching, such as: How are various personal resources of teachers and social resources of the profession assembled in arguments for or against decisions relevant to teaching with open, novel problems? How do those teachers? arguments for practice vary across national contexts of mathematics teaching? How can that variance be leveraged to support the surfacing, challenging, and disrupting of US teachers? cultural assumptions about mathematics teaching and learning?<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Rising temperatures, coupled in some cases with prolonged droughts and fire suppression efforts, have created conditions conducive to unusually intense and widespread fires, including across many parts of the western United States. While exceptional for the century, it is unclear how unusual this fire activity is over long-term Earth history.  In order to better place modern fire activity into a longer-term context, it is necessary to develop reconstructions of burning that occurred prior to the satellite era (1979-present). Records of ancient fire have been developed from burn scars on tree rings, from charcoal in lake sediments, and from fire-derived compounds deposited on and stored in glacial ice. In tropical Northwest Australia, it is not possible to recover such data. The goal of this project is to develop methods to recover fire-derived compounds from stalagmites in caves in that region. Results are expected to provide a clearer understanding of the utility of stalagmites as a novel record of past burning, and allow its application to other fire-prone regions, including the western United States. The project will also provide opportunities for undergraduate student training.<br/><br/>Fire plays a critical role in the ecology of the tropics, but fuel loads, sources of ignition, and background climate conditions are often markedly different now than they were a century or more ago. Addressing the extent to which fire regimes are changing is complicated by the sparsity of high-resolution, long-term records of fire frequency and intensity spanning far beyond the instrumental era. Understanding the frequency and intensity of fire activity prior to the arrival of European pastoralists and during intervals of climate distinct from the modern era (e.g, the Little Ice Age: CE 1450- 1850) is critically important for managing current fires, estimating cascading effects of fires on plant and animal diversity, and maintaining ecosystem resiliency. This study aims to refine a novel paleofire proxy capable of addressing these limitations: pyrogenic organic compounds (including polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, PAHs) in stalagmites. Previous research by the PI and collaborators has revealed that stalagmites from a tropical Australian cave preserve changes in the type and abundance of pyrogenic compounds over time, with these shifts consistent with recent fire activity proximal to the cave. Burning of biomass produces PAHs, which are then transported into the underlying cave by monsoon rains, and incorporated into stalagmites as they crystallize from dripwater. While these results are extremely promising, the biochemical and hydrological mechanics of the cave system need to be further scrutinized before this method can be applied more widely. Toward that end, the PI and collaborators will perform field and laboratory experiments: (i) measurements of organic compounds such as PAHs in soil and cave dripwater prior to, immediately following, and a year after a prescribed burn over the cave site, (ii) replication of pyrogenic organic compound distributions in a coeval stalagmite sample, and (iii) comparison of the paleofire signals in a 20th century stalagmite to remote sensing data and records of fire derived from historical documents. This work will also provide training to several undergraduates at Cornell College in field and laboratory methods, a critical step in advancing their careers as scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PD uses an approach that engages teachers with web-based apps that allow them to test and experiment with their mathematical ideas. The apps, combined with guiding questions that challenge teachers? thinking about fractions and proportions, serve both to promote critical thinking about the concepts and to further developing their understandings of the concepts. The researchers will use an innovative approach, topic modeling, to examine the effectiveness of each of version of the PD. Topic modeling will allow the researchers to identify patterns in the language teachers use as they participate in the PD, and subsequently, to better understand the development of the understanding teachers develop. The project has promise to not only enhance teachers? instruction on topics with which students have traditionally struggled, but also to demonstrate the viability of Topic Models as a means to measure learning using natural language?an approach that could potentially replace large-scale, multiple-choice tests as a measure of student learning with learning activities in the classroom. <br/><br/>The project uses a design-based research approach to focus on three main goals: expansion of a pilot PD model to include fractions and proportions; testing of a conjecture about the PD model focused on supporting teachers in making connections between learning content in novel ways to developing pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) from their experiences; and implementing topic modeling as an assessment model for measuring changes in teachers? participation in the PD. Topic models will be used as the primary assessment, rather than pencil and paper assessments, because of their alignment to the content and the PD approach, which is highly interactive and focused on conjecture testing. The use of topic modeling opens an opportunity for qualitative data to be used as an assessment tool rather than relying on assessment instruments that may not be aligned to the instruction. Proposed outcomes of this work include: a pool of mathematical tasks for teachers that support playful engagement with important mathematical ideas; a guide outlining a coherent 30-hour experience for teachers that engages in developing both content knowledge and PCK related to fractions, ratios, and proportions; evidence of the PD program?s effectiveness that relies on topic modeling to measure change in teachers? participation and learning in the workshops; data on two different approaches to supporting teachers in linking content knowledge development to PCK development; and a coding framework that defines ?robust? understanding of fractions related to referent units and invariance. All aspects of the PD will be grounded in the use of dynamic, web-based ?toys? (apps) that have been designed to support the development of robust understandings of proportion and fraction concepts. Contributions to the field include the PD model, the robust understandings framework, and findings specific to the use of topic models. One such contribution will be further insight into the sample size necessary to use topic models for assessment, which will help the field better understand how to use this quantitative approach with relatively small qualitative data sets. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

The deep connections between the integers and a broad range of mathematical areas from geometry to number theory have direct analogues for lattices in Lie groups, and the way in which lattices in Lie groups sit at the interface of so many fields has made them of fundamental importance since the late 19th century. The primary motivation for this project is to deepen our understanding of these connections, in particular for hyperbolic manifolds and their close relatives. Hyperbolic geometry is the ""negatively curved"" counterpart to classical Euclidean geometry (zero curvature) and spherical geometry (positive curvature), and hyperbolic manifolds are poorly understood compared with their Euclidean and spherical counterparts. Relating hyperbolic manifolds to discrete subgroups of Lie groups provides access to a wide spectrum of mathematical tools, including algebra and dynamics, that have borne significant recent fruit, including recent work of the PI with U. Bader, D. Fisher, and N. Miller that gives a completely geometric characterization of which hyperbolic manifolds that are ""arithmetic"" (a family of immense significance, but one for which the definition is purely algebraic and not obviously tied to the geometry of the manifold). The overarching goal of this project is to use techniques from dynamics, geometry, algebraic geometry, and number theory to further our understanding of hyperbolic manifolds and closely-related generalizations called ""locally symmetric spaces"". The project provides support for graduate students allowing them time for research, collaboration, and travel to conferences. It will also support the PI's continued development of Inquiry-Based Learning tools for undergraduate teaching and organizing events like summer schools and conferences focused on graduate student professional development<br/><br/>This project aims to understand the geometry and topology of locally symmetric spaces, particularly real and complex hyperbolic manifolds, inspired by the fundamental problems in low-dimensional topology and geometric group theory that have dominated the fields since the pivotal work of Thurston and Gromov. On the one hand, it is of significant interest to learn the extent to which the Gromov-Thurston program pushes into this more general setting. More importantly, the questions studied in dimensions 2 and 3 for the last forty years are closely related to classical problems about discrete subgroups of Lie groups, and real and complex hyperbolic lattices are precisely the cases where many of the basic questions remain open, e.g., (non)triviality of Betti numbers and problems related to (non)arithmeticity. Particular problems to be studied include analogues of the Margulis superrigidity theorem in rank one, building on the PI's recent breakthroughs with Bader-Fisher-Miller, and understanding complex hyperbolic lattices using techniques from algebraic geometry and continuing/generalizing the PI's work with D. Toledo on connections between residual finiteness of central extensions of complex hyperbolic lattices and constructions of interesting new smooth projective algebraic varieties admitting metrics of negative curvature.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The relative movement of an electrically conducting fluid (e.g., liquid metal coolant, saltwater, ionized gases, or plasmas) in a magnetic field is important as it has many applications in, e.g., nuclear reactors, artificial suns to produce carbon-free electricity, artificial hearts, magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) pumps, and geomagnetic dynamos. The accurate numerical simulation of the interaction between the velocity field of the fluid and the magnetic field is often computationally challenging, arduous, and prohibitively expensive even with the use of an advanced computing facility. This is because the two fields are non-linearly coupled. Moreover, many practical flows occur in a convection-dominated regime and their numerical simulations using standard algorithms produce numerical instability. The scenario is exacerbated by the presence of noise in the input data. The involvement of input uncertainties reduces the accuracy of the final solutions. Therefore, it is important to develop long-range high fidelity numerical algorithms for simulating such a complex problem. First, this project will investigate efficient ensemble schemes for simulating incompressible flow problems (without the presence of a magnetic field). Second, this project will focus on understanding the numerical instability and develop robust, efficient, and accurate algorithms for simulating complex flow problems where velocity and magnetic fields interact. This project will facilitate the teaching and training of students from underrepresented groups to pursue their careers in STEM fields. This will be carried out by supporting and supervising undergraduate and graduate students' research in numerical analysis and scientific computing.<br/><br/>The focus of this project is to understand the numerical instability in the uncertainty quantification (UQ) of Navier-Stokes (N-S) and MHD flow simulations. The objective of this project is to develop, analyze, and test robust, and efficient novel algorithms of N-S and MHD flow ensembles simulations. The first research goal is to develop and investigate an efficient Stabilized Penalty-projection Finite Element Method (SPP-FEM) for the UQ of fluid flow simulations. The SPP-FEM is presented in an elegant way that at each time-step, it permits a shared system matrix for each realization in conjunction with a stabilized penalty-projection step. It is conjectured that the scheme will be unconditionally stable with respect to the time-step size and would be much faster and more computationally efficient than standard numerical methods. The second research goal is to develop a Proper Orthogonal Decomposition (POD) based Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) stabilized Evolve-Filter-Relax Stochastic Collocation ROM (EFR-SCM-ROM) algorithm to deal with the numerical oscillations, which commonly arise in ROM of the UQ of MHD flow ensembles. The EFR-SCM-ROM algorithm approximates the randomness of the parameters using stochastic collocation methods (SCMs) and uses a high-order ROM spatial differential filter in conjunction with an evolve-then-filter-then-relax scheme to attenuate the numerical oscillations of standard ROMs. The new EFR-SCM-ROM framework yields accurate approximations, minimizes the sensitivity of noise in input data, and uses rigorous error estimates to determine practical parameter scaling. The SPP-FEM and EFR-SCM-ROM algorithms are innovative and considered novel approaches, which will enrich and revolutionize the computational methodology and platform for the numerical approximation of MHD flow ensembles. These studies will advance the knowledge base in the field of MHD flow ensembles and other fields of multi-physics problems, including Boussinesq systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These gels are capable of exerting contraction forces, which allow cells to move, divide, and change shape. Although it is well known that these gels consume chemical energy and exert mechanical power, the relationship between energy consumption and power exertion is not well understood. This proposal aims to quantify this relationship by measuring both the energy consumption and mechanical power simultaneously. This work will directly address the energy-consuming nature of materials containing actin and myosin, which will elucidate how these proteins can deform cells and tissues. Furthermore, this proposal will develop gels of actin and myosin as actuators for soft robots. These robots will take advantage of the dynamic nature of actin-myosin gels to switch on-the-fly between optimal states. In addition, this research will inspire an educational robotics project that seeks to build a robot that is powered by the expulsion of a fluid. <br/><br/>Technical Abstract <br/><br/>Active matter, including active gels of the cytoskeletal proteins actin and myosin, comprises a fascinating class of systems wherein macroscopic phenomena emerge from a microscopic consumption of chemical energy. Can this energy consumption be harnessed to power mechanical tasks? This question has been extensively explored in the context of active fluids, which can rotate gears and drive flows. More recently, theoretical studies have looked at the work done by self-propelled particles. However, existing studies have not investigated cases where active gels deform their environment. Thus, the mechanical power output of cytoskeletal actomyosin gels remains poorly understood. The existence of this problem is surprising, considering the central role that the actomyosin cytoskeleton plays in driving deformations on cellular and tissue levels. This proposal aims to quantify the relationship between microscopic energy consumption and macroscopic power exertion by measuring both the energy consumption and mechanical power simultaneously. Furthermore, this proposal will develop the principles of applying such gels as actuators for various soft-robotics applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Broader acceptance of CCS is hindered by the perceived risk of carbon dioxide leakage from the underground reservoir being used for storage.  To help manage risk, any CCS endeavor must use a system of monitoring to detect leaks, such as seismic monitoring. This project addresses several challenges in the development of a seismic monitoring system that is sustainable into the indeterminate future. These challenges include noisy data from permanent and low-cost sensors, high-dimensional data needed to describe the carbon dioxide plume underground, the need for uncertainty quantification to assure stakeholders, and automated detection of leaks for continuous monitoring systems. This project includes activities to broaden participation in computational science, including the development and deployment of a short course on machine learning for scientific applications geared to students with diverse backgrounds, interests, and career goals.<br/><br/>The technical aim of this project is to develop a methodology for monitoring critical carbon dioxide plumes in underground storage reservoirs that combines time-lapse seismic imaging, physical simulation, and uncertainty quantification.  The work extends current practice by using Bayesian data assimilation with a fluid flow simulation for the carbon dioxide plume. For this to be tractable, conditional invertible neural networks are used to represent complex probability distributions. The data assimilation is also coupled with joint recovery methods. The posterior distribution of the carbon dioxide plume is input into a generative classifier to automatically detect leakages while also estimating uncertainty.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such inequalities measure the oscillation and cancellation in the Fourier transform of various curved geometric surfaces such as the paraboloid, cone, or moment curve. These inequalities arise from studying partial differential equations such as the Schrdinger equation or wave equation and also from number theory through exponential sums, which can be thought of as Fourier series that encode certain arithmetic data. Over the years, tools in these two areas have developed somewhat independently from each other. One aim of this project is to bring more tools from number theory into Fourier analysis. The connections between these two areas will be studied with hopes of proving decoupling inequalities for a wider and more general class of surfaces and improving upon quantitative versions of these inequalities. Activities will further include organizing an online seminar, several undergraduate activities, and even presentations motivated by the research that are accessible to the public.<br/><br/>In 2015, Bourgain, Demeter, and Guth were able to prove a decoupling theorem for the moment curve from which the Main Conjecture in Vinogradov's Mean Value Theorem (VMVT), a longstanding open question from 1935, followed as a corollary. Their method was purely Fourier analytic. At roughly at the same time, Wooley used his method of efficient congruencing to give a purely number theoretic proof of the VMVT. Decoupling and efficient congruencing developed separately and independently of each other. One objective of this project is to further study connections between them. Previous attempts at interpreting ideas from efficient congruencing from the perspective of decoupling have yielded fresh insights and new points of views. The project includes a continued study of progress on VMVT in hopes of uncovering new tools in harmonic analysis to use them to prove decoupling estimates for a more general class of surfaces. Other goals of this project are to obtain improved quantitative estimates for VMVT via decoupling over local fields which has applications, for example, to the Riemann zeta function. Additionally, work will be done on proving decoupling estimates for different norms and surfaces and more refined situations where more information is known than what is typically given.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In artificial photosynthesis, solar energy is converted into chemical energy through generation of clean fuels such as hydrogen. Water serves as a source of electrons and protons for fuel forming reaction but its splitting into hydrogen and oxygen requires rearrangement of chemical bonds at high potential. Molecular catalysts which contain earth-abundant iron, cobalt and manganese can facilitate water splitting by lowering the potential and, thus, boosting energy conversion efficiencies.  The development of artificial photosynthesis and its large-scale implementation is expected to address the energy needs of modern society and facilitate transition to a CO2 neutral economy.

The project will tackle this issue along three fronts: (i) by devising a modification to the widely used method-of-moment approaches from economics and statistics that account for imperfectly measured data, (ii) by providing formal statistical methods that account for the fact that researchers typically adapt the complexity of their model based on the amount of data they have, and (iii) by developing forecasting methods that combine the predictions of multiple (possibly imperfect) models to yield more robust forecasts. To accomplish this, techniques developed in very diverse fields of study will be combined and augmented, and their advantages in contexts very different from where they initially were conceived will be leveraged. The methods to be developed generally can be applied in many areas of study that employ statistical modeling and thus could impact fields as diverse as medicine, weather forecasting, pandemic evolution predictions, climate modeling, or the evaluation of the effectiveness of social intervention programs. Graduate students will be involved in the research process, and computer programs implementing the new methods will be made publicly available.<br/><br/>This research project will solve the problem of assigning a logical interpretation to the method of moments when the data rejects the model. The problem will be addressed by determining the minimum amount of measurement error that would be needed to reach agreement between the data and the model. This approach will draw from two currently very active areas of research, namely, empirical likelihood and optimal transport. Another part of the project will provide researchers with methods to account for their model selection process when making statistical inference by leveraging techniques from the general field of nonstandard inference. Finally, the project will exploit the largely overlooked fact that a multi-model forecasting process can be written as a model selection problem, where the model selection variables can be set-valued, thus emphasizing a connection with the so-called set-identified models, which have received considerable attention in recent years.

A generalized algorithm runs for transfinitely many steps, and even a single step is too hard for an ordinary computer, but this kind of algorithmic thinking gives a useful perspective on mathematics.  This project will use the algorithmic perspective of computability theory to analyze various hierarchies from classical analysis, topological dynamics, and descriptive set theory.  Sometimes a hierarchy-derived tool, such as the measurability of a Borel set, is less powerful than a full hierarchy analysis, but still strong enough for many purposes.  The research will explore this distinction, among other questions.  The project will also support the training of graduate students. <br/><br/>Theorems about Borel sets are sometimes proved by recursing along the structure of the Borel sets, but more often they are proved via measure or category. When the usual measure and category approaches do not pan out, reverse mathematics provides one framework for formalizing the question of whether any measure or category approach could succeed.  This framework will be applied to analyze various theorems about Borel sets, in particular theorems from descriptive combinatorics.  Second, the PI will address a number of questions about computability-theoretic properties of hierarchies in classical analysis, such as the Bourgain rank or the hierarchy of Denjoy integrable functions.  Finally, shifts of finite type (SFTs) are certain topological dynamical systems which are simply described but exhibit complex behavior, because their dynamics can simulate Turing computations.

The PD uses an approach that engages teachers with web-based apps that allow them to test and experiment with their mathematical ideas. The apps, combined with guiding questions that challenge teachers? thinking about fractions and proportions, serve both to promote critical thinking about the concepts and to further developing their understandings of the concepts. The researchers will use an innovative approach, topic modeling, to examine the effectiveness of each of version of the PD. Topic modeling will allow the researchers to identify patterns in the language teachers use as they participate in the PD, and subsequently, to better understand the development of the understanding teachers develop. The project has promise to not only enhance teachers? instruction on topics with which students have traditionally struggled, but also to demonstrate the viability of Topic Models as a means to measure learning using natural language?an approach that could potentially replace large-scale, multiple-choice tests as a measure of student learning with learning activities in the classroom. <br/><br/>The project uses a design-based research approach to focus on three main goals: expansion of a pilot PD model to include fractions and proportions; testing of a conjecture about the PD model focused on supporting teachers in making connections between learning content in novel ways to developing pedagogical content knowledge (PCK) from their experiences; and implementing topic modeling as an assessment model for measuring changes in teachers? participation in the PD. Topic models will be used as the primary assessment, rather than pencil and paper assessments, because of their alignment to the content and the PD approach, which is highly interactive and focused on conjecture testing. The use of topic modeling opens an opportunity for qualitative data to be used as an assessment tool rather than relying on assessment instruments that may not be aligned to the instruction. Proposed outcomes of this work include: a pool of mathematical tasks for teachers that support playful engagement with important mathematical ideas; a guide outlining a coherent 30-hour experience for teachers that engages in developing both content knowledge and PCK related to fractions, ratios, and proportions; evidence of the PD program?s effectiveness that relies on topic modeling to measure change in teachers? participation and learning in the workshops; data on two different approaches to supporting teachers in linking content knowledge development to PCK development; and a coding framework that defines ?robust? understanding of fractions related to referent units and invariance. All aspects of the PD will be grounded in the use of dynamic, web-based ?toys? (apps) that have been designed to support the development of robust understandings of proportion and fraction concepts. Contributions to the field include the PD model, the robust understandings framework, and findings specific to the use of topic models. One such contribution will be further insight into the sample size necessary to use topic models for assessment, which will help the field better understand how to use this quantitative approach with relatively small qualitative data sets. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Although X-ray crystallography is the prevalent method for determining the 3-dimensional atomic structure of molecules, the mathematical foundations of this theory are not fully developed. Cryo-EM is a recent technique in biological imaging where a sample (typically a protein) is flash-frozen in a liquid solution and then directed with a low-intensity electron beam. Ptychography is a method of obtaining a high-resolution image by scanning across a sample with a moving mask. It can be applied in a number of contexts, including the imaging of live cells. Ultra-short pulse detection is a key ingredient in time-resolved ultrafast phenomena such as chemical reactions. This research will create a unified set of mathematical techniques to understand these methods. The development of these techniques will have the potential for a myriad of applications in areas as diverse as biochemistry, medicine, and engineering. This research will also provide a training opportunity for graduate students.<br/> <br/>This research will exploit techniques from invariant theory and algebraic geometry to build a mathematical framework for four methods in imaging and optics. X-ray crystallography corresponds to recovering a signal from its power spectrum. This is arguably the most challenging phase-retrieval problem. The first project aims to develop rigorous mathematical criteria to determine when a discrete periodic signal can be recovered from its power spectrum. Because cryo-EM measurements have a very high noise level, constructing a high-resolution image requires massive data. The second project will use techniques from invariant theory to estimate the sample complexity of cryo-EM and related experiments. Ptychographic measurements can be modeled using the short-time Fourier transform (STFT). The third project will obtain information-theoretic bounds on the number of STFT measurements needed for signal recovery. The last project will focus on the mathematical foundations of a novel technique for pulse characterization using multi-mode fibers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These processes are major sources of individual differences that are often implicated in psychological and neurological disorders.  This project offers new insights into the linkage, focusing on the selective nature of attention and memory retrieval, and testing the conjecture that memory retrieval is perceptual attention turned inward. The research develops new experimental procedures that apply methods for studying perceptual attention to the understanding of memory retrieval. It provides new measures -- of the sharpness of the focus of attention on memory, and the ability to resist distraction from competing memories -- that are not available in current methodologies and which are not addressed in extant theories.  The research tests new mathematical theories of selective attention and memory retrieval that specify how memory lists are represented and how retrieval processes can access items in the list selectively.  The theories show that attention and memory retrieval rely on the same mathematical principles.  Computer simulations based on these principles reproduce critical patterns of human behavior.  The primary goal of the research is to develop empirically supported computational models that provide deeper insights into the cognitive and neural basis of the interaction between attention and memory.  Understanding the computational principles facilitates integration and comparison with current theories of attention and memory that address other phenomena, like memory encoding or dividing attention between inputs or tasks.  The materials, code, and data generated by this project are openly available to everyone.  A broader goal of the research is to provide a strong empirical and theoretical basis for applied research in education and the workplace and to provide new theory-based measures of individual differences and clinical disorders.  The broadest goal of the research is to disseminate the acquired knowledge to a wide range of audiences, from lay people to scientists, through accessible publications and participation in workshops and summer schools.  The beneficiaries included undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, who engage in all aspects of the research process, thus encouraging them to pursue careers in science.<br/><br/>This project establishes new empirical connections between attention and memory by adapting the Eriksen flanker task (which is primarily used to study perceptual attention) to measure selective memory retrieval.  The new episodic flanker task measures the sharpness of the focus of attention on memory and the ability to resist distraction from flanking items. It requires subjects to remember a list of items (e.g., RFCKGL) and presents a probe display that cues a single item (e.g., ##C###).  Subjects are asked to indicate whether the cued item was in the same position in the memory list.  The sharpness of their focus on memory is measured by presenting non-matching items from the list that differ in their distance to the probed item (e.g., ##K### vs. ##L###).  Nearby items that fall within the focus of attention are harder to reject than distant items outside the focus.  Resistance to distraction is measured by presenting flanking letters that match (e.g., RFCKGL) or mismatch (STCPXV) the memory list and subsequently observing how effectively subjects can ignore the flankers.  Performance is better when cued and flanking letters ?point? to the same response and is worse when they point to opposite responses.  Flanking letters that match the target improve performance for ?yes? responses but impair performance for ?no? responses; flanking letters that mismatch the target impair performance for ?yes? responses and improve performance for ?no? responses.  The size of the improvements and impairments reflects the ability to resist distraction.  This research establishes new theoretical connections between attention and memory by adapting computational models of memory retrieval to the episodic flanker task, interpreting their retrieval cues as spotlights of attention focused on memory, and asking whether their spotlights predict the observed distance and compatibility effects. It interprets three memory models (noisy coding, position coding, and item coding) as examples of three classic approaches to selective attention (space-based, object-based, and template-based, respectively), connecting a broad range of memory theory and attention theory.  The proposed research claims that retrieval and attention are different names for the same computations, explained by the same underlying mathematics.  The research evaluates this claim with a broad range of items, from letters and words to colors and pictures, with a range of timescales that encompass both short-term and long-term memory, and with a broad range of tasks that tap the same representations, relating serial recall and cued recall to cued recognition in the episodic flanker task.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Contamination of groundwater by poly-fluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) is increasingly recognized as a major environmental issue. Sometimes called ?forever chemicals,? these compounds bioaccumulate, can cause adverse health outcomes, and are difficult to break down. Plasma technologies offer promising avenues to remediation, especially via the production of free electrons dissolved in water (?solvated electrons?). This award supports Dr. Light at Colorado College in a project to study the production of solvated electrons by atmospheric pressure plasma. The award will also provide the resources to involve a significant number of undergraduates from minoritized backgrounds in cutting edge research through a ?research incubator? course and funded summer research positions.<br/><br/> <br/>The overarching goal of this research program in the next five to ten years is to understand the physics and chemistry involved in using low-temperature plasma (LTP) to break apart and extract  recalcitrant contaminants from water.  The project seeks to measure the time-dependent concentration of solvated electrons  at the water?s surface by adapting an existing spectroscopic technique. Supercontinuum transient absorption spectroscopy is a well-established method for studying time-resolved chemical and physical processes, but it has not yet been applied to LTP or to the plasma/water interface. The development of this diagnostic would open new avenues for time-resolved studies of LTP and of the chemistry they drive. The proposed study will also illuminate the landscape of atmospheric pressure plasma jets as sources for solvated electrons, yield information about what plasma parameters are important to the process, and guide efforts to optimize plasma sources for remediation applications. This award funds a pilot ?research incubator? course designed for first- and second-year students from underrepresented backgrounds in order to lower the entry barrier into undergraduate research positions. The course will run twice during the grant period, with a cap of ten students each time.

While the nutrients underneath glaciers are known to be important for nearby biological communities, comparatively less is known about the chemistry and importance of glacier surfaces and snowpack, which can trap dust -  small particles of rock that are deposited by wind and with snowfall. The dust is darker than ice and snow and therefore can warm during sunny periods and melt the surrounding frozen water, generating small amounts of liquid water. During cloudy and cold periods, solar radiation can no longer heat the particles and the liquid water around the dust freezes again. These thawing and freezing cycles can break down the dust and release nutrients, such as iron, which can potentially be used by organisms in the ice or can be transported to streams, lakes, and/or the ocean during periods of high melt. This research will combine computer modeling and laboratory experiments to understand 1) what happens (chemically and physically) to glacier and snowpack dust during freezing and thawing and 2) how to model freezing and thawing of water and dust in glacier ice. Two traveling exhibits exploring the connections between science and art will result from this project, allowing for diverse audiences to connect with the Antarctic continent and understand how small-scale science influences large-scale systems. The results of this study will determine the geochemistry of glacial meltwater due to freezing and thawing, and whether the meltwater contains critical nutrients for surrounding ecosystems.<br/><br/>Despite low temperatures and the relative scarcity of liquid water, glacial systems can be a major source of trace metals, nutrients and other weathering products to proglacial and marine systems. While the importance of weathering has been established in subglacial and proglacial environments, less is understood about weathering mechanisms or the composition of major and trace nutrients at the most upstream source: within snow and supraglacial ice. Wind deposits fine-grained sediment on ice surfaces, which can then melt or become incorporated into the ice profile and experience a range of thermal regimes and freeze-thaw conditions. Daily freeze-thaw cycling drives physical and chemical weathering of sediment grains, yet few studies have explicitly examined the frequency and intensity of freeze-thaw cycles and how they control major ion and trace metal release, alteration, and mobility. This interdisciplinary study will use geochemical and energy balance modeling, freeze-thaw experimentation, and scanning electron microscopy to advance knowledge of mineral weathering in ice and snow active layers. Existing samples collected from the McMurdo Dry Valleys of Antarctica, an ecosystem that relies on runoff derived from supraglacial ice and snow melt, will be utilized. Two traveling exhibits exploring the connections between science and art will result from this project, the first focused on connecting the macro-scale Antarctic continent to micro-scale microscopy images, and the second a contemporary art exhibit that will explore the Antarctic continent and our perceptions of scale. Findings from this research will contribute to knowledge of nutrient bioavailability and delivery to proglacial environments and polar oceans, watershed-scale weathering in glacial systems, and the conditions that create microsites for life on glaciers and other icy systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Existing formative assessment frameworks require extensive prior content knowledge and theory concerning the nature of student skill mastery and the process by which skills are joined to determine cognitive performance. This project will provide researchers with new tools for inferring the learning process from dynamic, longitudinal data on student performance and offer a framework for evaluating substantive theory for how students learn. A central concern in the educational sciences is formulating and evaluating interventions. The project will develop accurate methods for researchers to gain a fine-grained understanding as to the effectiveness of learning interventions. The new methods will leverage student responses to longitudinal assessments to offer educators and policymakers with insights regarding the status and timing of student mastery of educational content. The methods also will shed light on the effectiveness of educational interventions with the goal of establishing strategies for formulating personalized learning interventions to accelerate student learning. To achieve these aims, the project will advance fundamental theory in statistics and psychometrics. In addition to broadening methodological theory, the project will strengthen the educational assessment infrastructure.

In this project, funded by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and housed in the Chemistry Division, Professor Binglin Sui and his students will work to develop a series of stimuli-responsive, biocompatible and biodegradable polymers and polymer-based nanomaterials that can be extensively utilized in the biological and medical worlds. Biosafety and sustainability have become two critical issues of bio-oriented nanomaterials with the rapid development of nanotechnology, resulting from the fact that those materials with nanoscale sizes could not be eliminated from the body and their accumulation in the body is likely to induce chronic systemic toxicities. The new polymers that Prof. Sui will develop consist of biodegradable polymer chains containing bio-cleavable chemical bonds. Therefore, in biological and physiological environments, the polymers and polymer-based nanomaterials will gradually break down and eventually turn into nontoxic small molecules in the body, devoid of biosafety and sustainability concerns. Prof. Sui will use cancer-related biomedical applications of the new materials to promote students? awareness of human health issues and to get graduate and undergraduate students as well as the underrepresented Native American students from tribal colleges in North Dakota engaged in the research. <br/><br/>Prof. Sui proposes to address the challenges of nanomaterials that are currently preventing the majority of materials with nanoscale sizes from biomedical applications, especially for bioimaging and nanomedicine.

Risk assessment instruments (RAIs) are routinely used as critical supportive tools during the decision-making process. RAIs have begun to adapt machine learning models to identify the risk of recidivism. Few RAIs consider the possibility for change, which is especially important when assessing youth who are amenable to treatment. Furthermore, RAIs may suffer from algorithmic bias which can arise due to the inherent bias in the data used to train them, as well as run into the risk of leaking sensitive personal information. Despite recent progress in building private machine learning models in other domains, the literature on maintaining user privacy for RAI models for criminal justice domains are critically lacking.  This project?s novelties are the design of a framework for risk assessment that can incorporate the impact of interventions while simultaneously achieving individual fairness and data privacy. The project?s broader significance and importance includes the building of trustworthy RAIs which can reduce disproportionate minority contact in juvenile justice systems.  <br/><br/>This project pursues the above goals via three inter-related research thrusts. Thrust 1 leverages and adapts the potential outcomes framework from causal inference to build intervention-aware risk assessment models.

Several new theoretical challenges have been tackled, including the operationalization of individual fairness constraints within the context of criminal justice and compatibility with differential privacy.

Oceanic plateaus are massive underwater volcanoes resulting from voluminous volcanic eruptions. They represent about 5% of oceanic crust and can easily cover areas as large as Alaska and reach thickness of tens of kilometers.  The formation of oceanic plateaus coincides with significant paleoclimate change and mass extinction. Therefore, studying oceanic plateaus is an important scientific pursuit which will advance our understanding of Earth?s dynamic systems and, possibly, past climate changes. However, the formation and internal structures of the oceanic plateaus are poorly understood because they are located kilometers underwater and thousands of kilometers away from land. The project will focus on advancing our understanding of the formation and structure of oceanic plateaus using marine magnetic data, and machine learning. The main hypothesis is that oceanic plateaus formed near spreading ridges and are dominated by linear magnetic anomalies, and therefore, linear volcanism. To test this hypothesis, the team will compare the spatial patterns of marine magnetic anomalies from three selected oceanic plateaus with good magnetic data coverage against those from two mid-ocean ridges, namely, the East Pacific Rise and the Mid-Atlantic Ridge. Instead of relying on visual inspection of magnetic anomalies, the team will implement three proven machine learning methods to help quantitatively compare the spatial patterns of the magnetic anomalies from the five regions. The project will help to accelerate new discoveries based on magnetic data and will help to retain and attract young talent to the area of magnetics, a proven method in critical mineral and planetary exploration. In addition, the project activities will create educational and training opportunities for students from underrepresented groups and help to develop America?s artificial intelligence workforce.<br/><br/>The prevailing view of oceanic plateaus is that they are centralized shield volcanoes formed by massive volcanism onto already existing oceanic crust. However, recent research proposed that Tamu and Ori Massifs formed by linear volcanism, a process similar to seafloor spreading volcanism. This project will provide new evidence to understand whether either of these two theories is valid or whether oceanic plateaus formed in a hybrid manner (i.e., both are true to an extent). In addition to investigating whether magnetic anomalies are linear, the research will give new clues about the geologic structure of oceanic plateaus, which is poorly known. An important aspect of the study is the application of machine learning to the analysis of marine magnetic anomalies over oceanic plateaus, which has not been attempted even though machine learning has achieved great success in many other areas including geoscience. Therefore, the proposed research will also advance our understanding of how machine learning, a new yet rapidly growing interest in the geoscience community, generates new knowledge when combined with marine magnetic data and applied to oceanic plateaus. The research will also help understand the advantages and limitations of the machine learning methods when applied to marine magnetic data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The physical behavior around singularities is generally highly complex, posing great challenges to the efforts of understanding their formation, structure, and influence on neighboring regions. The knowledge of the nature of singularities is fundamental to predict a system?s behavior or to develop effective applications for a material. This project considers systems in continuum mechanics and materials science that can be described directly or indirectly by a class of partial differential equations (PDE). The main goals include developing novel mathematical methods for analyzing this class of PDE and applying such new methods to better understand the nature of their singularities. This project will offer research and training opportunities to graduate and undergraduate students. <br/> <br/>Many nonlinear PDE modeling physical systems and materials can be formulated as differential inclusions. The nature of singularities in these problems is closely related to the rigidity and flexibility properties of the relevant differential inclusions. This project contains two main themes. The first theme aims to extend the general theory for rigidity and flexibility of differential inclusions, and to develop new analytical tools to study the rigidity and flexibility of scalar and systems of conservation laws viewed as differential inclusions. Specifically, the Eikonal equation and a two-by-two system of conservation laws for isentropic elasticity will be investigated as model problems. The investigator will combine methods from differential inclusions and hyperbolic conservation laws to advance the understanding of the structure of entropy solutions for systems and generalized entropy solutions for scalar equations. The second theme seeks to develop novel perspectives and analytical methods incorporating entropies, to study second order scalar and multi-valued problems in the calculus of variations, which are closely related to the Eikonal equation. Such problems arise in various physical settings, including thin films and layered elastic materials, liquid crystals, and self-organized convection patterns. The investigator plans to meld tools from variational analysis and those developed in the first part of this project to characterize the low-energy states. This analysis will inform the complex singularity structures in different physical settings of broad practical interest.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These mathematical disciplines are crucial for a host of scientific fields, including engineering, biology, and economics. For example, the mathematical modeling of any physical phenomenon that undergoes change over time can be viewed as a dynamical system. Similarly, geometry is the basis for numerous current industrial applications such as 3D printing. This research project will enhance the tools available in the aforementioned mathematical areas. The axiomatic development of geometry, which postulates a set of basic assumptions from which all other reasonable conclusions are logically deduced, dates back to ancient Greece. The major focus of this project is a detailed study of certain phenomena that occur when the Archimedean axiom, attributed to Archimedes of Syracuse, is no longer postulated. The resulting mathematics turns out to be useful even when the primary object of study is of the usual, Archimedean, kind. The project will also generate research opportunities at a variety of levels, suitable for work by graduate and undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project will employ non-Archimedean tools to study a range of problems in analysis, dynamics, and geometry. Essential to this endeavor is an understanding of Berkovich spaces, which are non-Archimedean analogues of real and complex manifolds. One component of the project involves a detailed study of the space of metrics on an ample line bundle on a compact complex manifold. Geodesic rays within this space can be studied via non-Archimedean methods. Another topic for consideration is the Kontsevich-Soibelman conjecture, which originally arose in the study of mirror symmetry. In the areas of analysis and dynamics, non-Archimedean techniques will be employed to construct invariant currents for two-dimensional complex dynamical systems, allowing for a study of the growth of arithmetic complexity along orbits of arithmetic dynamical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Number theorists are interested in classifying number fields whose symmetry groups (called Galois groups) have the commutative property, and in producing formulas to generate these special number fields.  Modern methods have demonstrated the connection between number fields and certain associated functions called L-functions, whose values encode many of the most important conjectures in number theory.  The principal investigator, Dr. Samit Dasgupta, has made important progress on these topics in recent work, and the current proposal aims to push further in this direction. Dr. Dasgupta also plans to continue and expand his activities to disseminate mathematics to students and academics of all age groups and career stages. Dr. Dasgupta gives expository lectures for undergraduates in various math clubs, teaches minicourses for graduate students, is involved in graduate and postdoctoral advising, is involved in local conference organizing, and is on the editorial board of several journals. All these activities connect to Dr. Dasgupta?s goal to promote mathematics holistically in society, with a particular view toward supporting various groups that have been traditionally underrepresented. <br/><br/>More technically, Dr. Dasgupta?s work is motivated by two central problems in modern algebraic number theory: the expression of special values of classical and p-adic L-functions as regulators of algebraic objects, and the generation of abelian extensions of number fields through analytic means intrinsic to the ground field, as codified in Hilbert's 12th problem.  Dr. Dasgupta?s prior work has made significant progress on the Brumer-Stark Conjecture, the Gross-Stark Conjecture, and the explicit analytic construction of class fields of totally real fields.  Dr. Dasgupta will continue his explorations in this direction with five specific questions on the connections between Stark units, L-functions,  modular forms, and Galois representations.  All these projects will advance our knowledge in a significant way on the relationship between special values of L-functions and associated algebraic objects. Firstly, he will complete the proof of the Brumer-Stark conjecture by handling the localization at p=2. Next, he will extend his work with Kakde to prove the Equivariant Tamagawa Number Conjecture for the minus part of CM abelian extensions of totally real fields, including at the prime 2.  In joint work with Spiess, Dr. Dasgupta will prove their joint conjecture on the characteristic polynomial of Gross's regulator matrix.  Separately, he will work with Darmon and Charollois on expanding the strategy of Darmon, Vonk, and Pozzi for real quadratic fields to give a purely p-adic analytic proof of Dr. Dasgupta's explicit analytic formula for Brumer-Stark units over arbitrary totally real fields.  Dr. Dasgupta will work with Victor Rotger to study a conjecture of Harris and Venkatesh relating the derived Hecke operators defined by Venkatesh to Stark units in the Galois extension cut out by the adjoint of the Galois representation attached to weight one forms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Clearly, addressing ?Sustainability? is an overarching challenge for the 21st century at local, national, and international levels. Having a cadre of engineers who are broadly trained in sustainability is vital to ensure the quality of life for current and future generations. Today in the United States, undergraduate degree programs in ?Sustainability? are of two types: interdisciplinary programs that do not grant engineering degrees, and Environmental Engineering programs that do not broadly address sustainability. However, there are no undergraduate engineering degree programs in the US that are comprehensively oriented around sustainability. Therefore, a new type of engineering program is needed ? to complement, not substitute ? the existing approaches to sustainability education and engineering education. Toward this end, this project will work collaboratively with stakeholders to create a new Minor program that will feature active recruitment, an immersive summer camp, new courses, a community of practice, and cooperative learning experiences that will promote workforce development in Puerto Rico with local partners. The Minor will take a socio-technical approach that mingles engineering with the humanities, and will challenge students to work with diverse members of vulnerable communities as co-designers, culminating with the aspiration ?to develop professionals to work under the People, Prosperity, Planet, Partnership and Peace paradigm that strives to foster human well-being in balance with the biosphere?. This positive, social responsibility framework will be instrumental for recruiting women and students from other underrepresented populations.<br/><br/>The project will investigate mindsets and competencies that relate to sustainable engineering, using a Delphi study with a broad pool of stakeholders to identify and rank what is essential for ?sustainable engineering?. In parallel to this, using existing survey instruments as a basis, the evolution of student mindset in four domains ? self-efficacy, engineering and technology, the conception of sustainability, and diversity, equity and inclusion ? will be studied qualitatively and longitudinally as students progress through the program; this will occur through interviews, reflective activities embedded in course activities and assignments, and observation in program activities. A parallel program evaluation will be led by an external evaluator to measure the impact of the project on student profiles, particularly on the recruitment of women. The strategies of the project are anticipated to lead to measurable increases in female enrollment in the engineering programs in which women are least represented, particularly in fields related to Computing and Electrical Engineering. In aggregate, this work will result in new instruments for gauging a next-generation ?sustainability engineering mindset?, and a corresponding model for recruitment and curricular design. As an extension of the mindset research, the project will serve to normalize diversity, equity, and inclusion practices at the University, including informing new practices for collecting and maintaining demographic data. A new cadre of bilingual, Hispanic students, with increased representation of women, will be broadly trained for meaningful, sustainability-focused employment in Puerto Rico, particularly through partnerships with key stakeholders. Through direct budget support, as well as interaction with a pool of highly-trained, sustainability-focused engineers, these partners will be able to strengthen and expand their enterprises, feeding into the emerging circular economy and ecosystem in Puerto Rico. In summary, the project will support the objectives of the HSI Program, which aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education and build capacity at HSIs. Projects supported by the HSI Program will also generate new knowledge on how to achieve these aims.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The disease management strategies informed by models of vector-borne diseases (such as diseases spread by mosquitoes) led to the elimination of malaria from the United States and other countries. However, malaria continues to have an enormous impact on resource-challenged regions of the world, while other existing and emerging vector-borne diseases such as West Nile Virus, Dengue Virus, and Zika Virus continue to impact both advanced and resource-challenged economies. A shortcoming of many existing modeling approaches is the absence of an explicit connection between economic factors and disease transmission ? two factors that influence each other. In an increasingly connected and complex world, accounting for the synergistic effects of these factors is essential for effective disease control. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused sudden economic shifts that affected the progress of malaria control programs, resulting in increases in malaria-related deaths. In collaboration with an ecologist/economist and with an entomologist and a biostatistician from Africa, the investigators will build mathematical tools to bridge this gap, which will be used to inform public health and economic growth policies. The project will train graduate students through involvement in the research. Workshops on feedback between economic and disease systems will train a new generation of undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds on this important topic. This work will also involve students from Africa, a continent that is highly affected by vector-borne diseases. <br/> <br/>Incorporating socio-economic factors into vector-borne disease (VBD) systems is key to identifying new interventions, by unraveling the intertwined relationship between VBD, socio-economic conditions, and transient events. The investigators aim to develop a new mechanistic framework for transient disease dynamics that accounts for feedback between VBDs and economic systems, the impact of fast-slow time scales, and sudden endogenous and exogenous events that shift the economic landscape. Factors including heterogeneous mosquito-biting and insecticide-treated-net (ITN) replacement times, demographic structure, and human behavior in relation to ITN use will be included. For even the simplest economic-VBD model, standard methods for computing basic epidemiological metrics and performing structural identifiability analysis break down. Hence, the investigators also plan to build the mathematical toolbox required to analyze and simulate these coupled systems. Although the framework will be applied to malaria as a prototype VBD using socio-economic and epidemiological data from Kenya, Madagascar, and West Africa to calibrate the parameters and validate the outcomes of the models, it is intended to be robust enough to be applicable to other VBDs. Furthermore, the framework will allow the investigators to realistically answer important public health and economic growth questions, including how to distribute ITNs across connected populations, and how to respond to spontaneous events affecting the economic landscape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address this challenge, this project?s goal is to design a network of airborne drones and wireless sensors that can aid in initial wildfire localization and mapping, near-term prediction of fire progression, and providing communications support for firefighting personnel on the ground. Two key aspects differentiate the system from prior work: (1) It leverages and subsequently updates detailed three-dimensional models of the environment, including the effects of fuel type and moisture state, terrain, and atmospheric/wind conditions, in order to provide the most timely and accurate predictions of fire behavior possible, and (2) It adapts to hazardous and rapidly changing conditions, optimally balancing the need for wide-area coverage and maintaining communication links with personnel in remote locations. The science and engineering developed under this project can be adapted to many applications beyond wildfires including structural fires in urban and suburban settings, natural or man-made emergencies involving radiation or airborne chemical leaks, ""dirty bombs"" that release chemical or biological agents, or tracking highly localized atmospheric conditions surrounding imminent or on-going extreme weather events.<br/><br/>The system developed under this project will enable more rapid localization and situational awareness of wildfires at their earliest stages, better predictions of both local, near-term and event-scale behavior, better situational awareness and coordination of personnel and resources, and increased safety for fire fighters on the ground. Models ranging from simple algebraic relationships based on wind velocity to more complex time-dependent coupled fluid dynamics-fire physics models will be used to anticipate fire behavior. These models are hampered by stochastic processes such as the lofting of burning embers to ignite new fires, that cause errors to grow rapidly with time. This project is focused on closing the loop using sensor data provided by airborne drones and ground-based sensors (GBS). The models inform the sensing by anticipating rapid growth of problematic phenomena, and the subsequent sensing updates the models, providing local wind and spot fire locations. Closing this loop as quickly as possible is critical to mitigating the fire?s impact. The system we propose integrates advanced fire modeling tools with mobile drones, wireless GBS, and high-level human interaction for both the initial attack of a wildfire event and subsequent on-going support.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is particularly important when considering the learning opportunities for groups that have historically been marginalized in mathematics, including girls and students of color. There are few validated, mathematics-specific instruments that measure teachers? beliefs about mathematics learning related to race, ethnicity, and gender. This project seeks to investigate teachers? beliefs related to how they explain the systemic racial and gender differences in mathematics education outcomes by developing and validating a survey instrument and to explore how those beliefs might impact their teaching. The central hypothesis of the project is that teachers? beliefs about attributions of mathematical excellence interact with students? racial and gender identities to cause racial and gender inequity in the learning opportunities available to students in the same mathematics classrooms. The basis of these beliefs may be attributions to genetic, social, or personal characteristics that are based in biased and inaccurate conceptions of the sources of mathematical excellence.<br/><br/>In order to achieve the project's main aims, the project will conduct three interrelated studies. (1) The Attributions and Items study will use interviews with teachers, teacher educators, and researchers to write, pilot, and refine items to establish reliability and construct representation of the Attributions of Mathematical Excellence Scale (AMES). (2) The Structure & Relations Study will provide validity evidence of internal structure and relations with other variables, including established equity instruments, and a measure of implicit bias. Student test data linked with a subset of the sample will be used to compare AMES scores with race and gender equity in achievement. This study will be expanded to include samples of preservice and inservice teachers and use a variety of data sources including interviews, surveys and classroom observation. (3) The Classroom Study will compare AMES scores with direct observation of race and gender equity in classroom instruction. Through the development of the instrument and analysis of scores, the project team will be able to posit and design teacher professional learning opportunities that have the potential to address the sources of bias.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

The resulting interior rainwater damage and extended periods of loss in building functionality can have substantial adverse effects on the socio-economic systems within and surrounding urban communities. Past studies of damage after high wind events have recognized that more than 80% of glass breakage was caused by windborne debris (such as broken glass pieces and materials from neighboring buildings) rather than direct wind pressure loading the glass. Appropriate cost-effective solutions begin with a comprehensive understanding of this vulnerability. However, the highly turbulent urban wind field around densely clustered buildings significantly complicates the accurate modeling and prediction of windborne debris transport and impact. This project will model the underlying physical process of the debris impact on clustered urban buildings through a combination of 1) a novel wind tunnel test program at the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI)  boundary layer wind tunnel at the University of Florida, 2) data-driven computer simulation approaches, and 3) physics-based models of debris origin, flight, and impact. The result will be a new debris damage vulnerability assessment platform that enables risk-consistent efforts to reduce wind damage to the urban building envelope. Concurrent with the research, an interactive augmented reality tool will be developed to visualize the three-dimensional flow around building clusters and debris flight trajectory. This will be the centerpiece of a summer program that exposes high school students from underrepresented groups to engineering and encourages STEM career paths.  Data generated by this project will be archived and made publicly available in the NHERI Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). <br/><br/>This research project will advance the understanding and modeling of the underlying physics of debris transport in urban winds through explicit modeling of complex urban flow features and debris flight trajectories around building clusters.

New wind tunnel experimental techniques will enable the project team to capture three-dimensional urban wind fields and debris trajectories, resulting in first-of-its-kind data necessary for developing the data-driven wind field models and systematically validating numerical trajectory models for complex urban winds. A novel integration between the wind tunnel experiments and data-driven modeling will be developed through active learning to efficiently predict wind fields for generic building clusters where wind tunnel data is not available. A probabilistic uncertainty quantification procedure will be developed to evaluate windborne debris damage risk through rigorous propagation of uncertainties from debris sources, urban wind fields, debris trajectory, and impact models. The outcome of this project will enable assessment and improvement of hurricane resilience for urban building clusters, which is a significant research gap present in community resilience planning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Solar technologies are increasingly providing energy across the US at costs well below even that of fossil fuels. In short, solar energy is delivering on its promise as a source of low cost, clean and renewable energy. However, solar solutions have largely been based on silicon, which is far from an optimal solution. New solutions must have the objective of making solar power ubiquitous, helping to fulfill our ever-expanding energy needs. These include solar power generating windows and building-integrated photovoltaics as well as devices that operate at very low light levels to scavenge waste illumination power. This is an urgent and fundamental technological challenge. Recently, there have been dramatic increases in the efficiency of potentially low-cost organic solar cells to over 19%, approaching that of silicon cells. This project is directed at determining the ultimate power conversion efficiency of organic solar cells. The investigators will study new organic materials with state-of-the-art optical spectroscopy to understand the power generating mechanisms that limit the efficiency of organic solar cells. The principles derived from these studies can provide molecular design rules and guide the improvement of organic solar cells towards their theoretical limit of ~25% efficiency. The project supports training of a diverse workforce through the education of graduate and undergraduate students in materials design, synthesis, and characterization, coupled with device engineering and scientific communication. The PIs will recruit and retain a diverse next generation of students in STEM fields through diversity, equity and inclusion efforts at the University of Michigan, including outreach to underrepresented groups and hosting a Conference for Undergraduate Women in Physics.<br/><br/>Technical Description. The primary goal of this project is to understand and improve organic photovoltaic (OPV) devices through improved materials and device design strategies based on quantum mechanical models. Dramatically reduced energy losses in the charge photogeneration process may ultimately provide a pathway towards ultralow cost solar power in situations where established, mature solar technologies are less effective. Beyond solar energy harvesting, these systems open new avenues for engineering materials for charge and energy transport at the atomistic level, and for their exploitation in applications as light emission, energy and charge transfer over exceptional distances, and may even result in extending electronic technology well beyond its current limits. This project combines the investigators? extensive expertise in OPV materials, design and characterization with state-of-the-art and emerging multidimensional spectroscopies to understand the energy loss mechanisms that currently limit single junction organic solar cell device efficiencies. The principles derived from these fundamental studies provide molecular design rules to guide the improvement of cell efficiencies towards their thermodynamic limit of ~25%. The work significantly expands the spectroscopic toolbox for probing OPVs, providing transformative opportunities for understanding the mechanisms of charge generation and concomitant energy losses. The research has the following primary goals: (i) Gain a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms governing charge generation and energy loss at organic heterojunctions (HJs) to increase the solar-to-electrical power conversion efficiency to near the thermodynamic limit; (ii) Map the complete HJ charge photogeneration process using multidimensional spectroscopy to probe the mechanisms of charge generation and the origins of energy loss; (iii) Exploit ultrastrong coupling in unique light harvesting architectures to realize exciton-polariton transfer with near-zero energy loss.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It would be impossible to walk or drive without friction. On the other hand, friction has negative impacts on mechanical devices because it causes wear, dissipates energy, and wastes non-renewable natural resources. This project aims to investigate superlubricity, a state where friction almost vanishes, on the contacts formed by organic molecules and graphene nanoribbons (GNRs). By measuring friction force on organic molecules sliding on GNRs, the project investigates the laws of friction at atomic scale and explores the origins of superlubricity, to complement the macroscopic laws of friction available in high school textbook and to aim for breakthroughs in tribology. The project may lead to GNRs as superlubricant monolayer materials applied to reduce the friction and wear of spintronic devices and other micro- and nano-electromechanical systems. The project is the first on physics and materials at the single atom/molecule level at Old Dominion University (ODU). It introduces ODU to research expertise and instrumentation resources not previously accessible on campus, and it broadens research participation among faculty and students from various science and engineering fields. This research also aims to inspire young minds, involving an ODU graduate student, a large number of ODU undergraduate students from minority groups, students from the Society of Black Physicists (SBP) formed by African American students in the Hampton Roads community, as well as K-12 high school students from the surrounding area. <br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT: <br/><br/>The project utilizes GNRs as solid-state supporting platforms to accommodate organic molecules, to quantify the force required to move a single molecule on GNRs using a low temperature Scanning Tunneling Microscope (STM) and a qPlus Atomic Force Microscope (Q+AFM), and aims to discover superlubricity on GNRs with static friction 1-2 orders of magnitude smaller than previously observed. Various molecular systems including single organic molecules, planar and non-planar, symmetric and non-symmetric in structure, on top of three different types of GNRs are investigated to unveil the origins of atomic scale friction and superlubricity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current building design for wind loads does not explicitly permit structures to behave beyond the linear elastic limit, even under ultimate wind loads. This linear design approach may limit the use of more innovative tall building systems with improved performance, safety, and economy. There is very little information concerning the nonlinear inelastic performance of tall buildings to wind in terms of the actual capacity and reliability of buildings against extreme wind loads. This project will address the critical research needs and close the knowledge gap for achieving PBWD of tall buildings with consideration of inelastic behavior. The project outcomes will be used to enrich instruction and training of graduate students. This award will contribute to the National Science Foundation (NSF) role in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). Project data will be archived and made publicly available in the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). Computational tools developed under this project will be integrated with software framework of the NSF-supported NHERI Computational Modeling and Simulation Center. <br/><br/>This research project has three specific objectives. First, the project will characterize the inelastic performance of tall buildings using high-fidelity, three-dimensional, nonlinear finite element building models with different heights and building structural systems under realistic three-dimensional dynamic wind loads. The response analysis will shed new insights on the unique characteristics of inelastic building response; biaxial and triaxial response interactions; influence of P-Delta, strength deterioration, and stiffness degradation; and influence of eccentricities in mass and rigidity.  Second, the project will develop reduced-order nonlinear building models and analysis frameworks for assessing probabilistic inelastic response. Modal push-over analysis under uniaxial, biaxial, and triaxial loads will be implemented to generate hysteretic generalized force models and to develop reduced-order nonlinear building models with computational efficiency. The accuracy of reduced-order building models will be validated through comprehensive response history analysis and comparison with the predictions from the high-fidelity nonlinear finite element models. Statistical linearization approaches will be developed to further facilitate the predictions of inelastic response statistics. Third, the project will establish frameworks for assessing the reliability of buildings with inelastic performance. Various uncertainties involved in the assessment of inelastic limit state building responses will be modelled and assessed. The fragility functions associated with multiple demands at different mean wind speeds and directions will be evaluated, and will be further integrated with the joint probability distribution of wind speed and direction for evaluation of building system reliability. The directionality effect of wind climate and aerodynamics on inelastic building performance will be evaluated for better building design to wind.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dispersive partial differential equations include the wave, Schrodinger, and Korteweg de-Vries equation. These equations are ubiquitous in physics, modeling phenomena ranging from the behavior of subatomic particles to interstellar gravity waves. Of particular interest are questions of long time behavior of  solutions. In other words, given certain initial data, does a solution to the equation exist? If a solution does exist, does it exist for all time? What is the behavior of the solution as time approaches either infinity or the maximum time for which the solution exists? Can we catalogue the various long time behaviors and obtain a complete description of the possible phenomena? The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>In this project, the Principal Investigator and his collaborators study the long time behavior of dispersive partial differential equations with initial data in a critical norm. Many diverse dispersive partial differential equations have a scaling symmetry, and a solution to the equation gives an entire family of solutions. Often, the scaling symmetry completely describes the local behavior of the equation completely: the equation is well-posed for initial data in the critical space, but it is ill-posed for data in a less regular (subcritical) space. We wish to understand the long time behavior for such equations at the critical regularity, where it is known that local well-posedness occurs. Additionally, in many such equations, the set where ill-posedness occurs in a subcritical space is often a set of measure zero. Thus, we hope to describe the nature of the set of initial data for which ill-posedness occurs. The specific problems that are addressed in this project are the Schrodinger maps problem, the focusing, mass-critical nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the energy subcritical nonlinear wave and Schrodinger equations, and the one dimensional cubic nonlinear Schrodinger equation. For the defocusing, energy subcritical problems, we expect scattering to occur for initial data in the critical Sobolev space. Solitons are known to occur for the Schrodinger map problem and the mass-critical nonlinear Schrodinger equation. In both cases, scattering is known to occur for initial data below the soliton (for Schrodinger maps this is only in the equivariant case). We wish to understand the solution for initial data slightly above the soliton for these problems. Finally, for the one dimensional nonlinear Schrodinger equation, the aim is to understand the long time behavior for initial data that does not decay at infinity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

We overcome this challenge by selectively attending to the world; that is, by prioritizing the processing of some kinds of information at the expense of others. But how is attention allocated and how much voluntary control do we have over that process? The answers to these research questions have vast implications for individual experience, and for society at large. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project advances our scientific understanding of how an observer?s past modulates their attention in the present. In addition to informing research in other core areas of psychology like learning and memory, the research outcomes have applications to clinical work, as aberrant attentional mechanisms are hypothesized to play a role in a multitude of mental health disorders (e.g., substance abuse, anxiety disorders, autism spectrum disorder). The PI is a faculty member at a primarily undergraduate institution, and this project provides unique opportunities for undergraduate research training and for STEM-focused innovation in the undergraduate classroom. As an additional component of the education plan, the PI furthers efforts to raise the visibility of established scientists from underrepresented communities and promotes inclusive mentoring in the service of retaining underrepresented students in science.<br/><br/>Visual attention can be allocated to specific locations in the visual field or to features of objects like color, orientation, or motion direction. Sometimes, shifts of attention are voluntarily generated to support goal-directed behavior. Other times, attention is ?captured? by physically salient objects (e.g., those that suddenly appear or are visually unique). While framing attention in such dichotomous terms has been the dominant theoretical approach for many decades, the literature now makes clear that non-salient stimuli can also capture attention. Such attentional biases rely on one?s unique history (e.g., if objects have been frequently attended in the past, or if they have been associated with receiving reward). Using behavioral and eye-tracking methods, the first research goal of this CAREER project is to disentangle the impact of two such historical factors on attentional control: frequent attentional allocation (selection history) and receiving of rewards (reward history). The second goal is to use functional brain imaging to examine the neural systems involved in selection-history-derived attentional biases and to test the hypothesis that information prediction errors generated by the ventral striatum modulate the allocation of visual attention. Whereas Aims 1 and 2 of the project focus on physically non-salient features that bias attention as a result of former experience, Aim 3 shifts the focus to physically salient stimuli and examines how saliency and history interact. Extending recent work from the PI?s laboratory, the third goal is to use psychophysical methods to model the temporal dynamics of visual processing when attention has been reflexively allocated by abrupt onsets that predict the presence or absence of available reward.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These perceptions appear to influence female students? interest and performance in math, as well as their pursuit of STEM careers. Given the potential motivational benefits of digital learning games, games might provide a pathway for reducing math anxiety for female students while increasing their self-efficacy and interest in math. This project will explore whether digital learning games can lead to less math anxiety and better learning in female students, while not hurting male student learning. It will study learning with two existing digital learning games: Decimal Point, which teaches foundational math concepts (decimal numbers and operations) to 5th and 6th grade students; and Angle Jungle, which targets a similar age range (4th and 5th graders) and has a similar thematic design (i.e., a game map, cartoon characters), but with different game mechanics, content (angles), and instructional approach. The study will explore how and why Decimal Point has, over the course of several experiments spanning multiple years, consistently produced a learning advantage for female students. In doing so, investigators will identify principles regarding the relationship between gender and game features that can be shared with game developers and used in other games, starting with Angle Jungle.<br/><br/>This work will go beyond the traditional gender binary of male and female, analyzing multiple dimensions of gender, including gender identity (e.g., how much students feel like a boy, a girl, both, neither), gender typicality (e.g., How much students like to do the same things as other girls [boys], How much students feel they look like boys [girls]), and gender-typed interests, activities, and traits (e.g., how much a student feels affectionate or adventurous). The study will also investigate two pathways hypothesized to lead to gender differences: first, that the playful features of the games reduce the saliency of the math content, making it less likely to cue math stereotype threat (the stereotype threat hypothesis); and second, that the games? thematic details are more appealing to learners who identify (more) as females, making the games more engaging for them compared to learners who identify (more) as boys (the engagement hypothesis). In Year 1, educational data mining will be used to infer students? cognitive and affective processes while playing Decimal Point and compare data to the distinct processes predicted by these two pathways. In Year 2, investigators will assess whether the hypothesized pathways and gender differences replicate in the context of Angle Jungle. In Year 3, hypotheses will be further tested by manipulating Decimal Point?s emphasis on math content in one version of the game and enjoyment and playful features in another. The project will compare learning outcomes between the two versions to more deeply explore the stereotype threat and engagement hypotheses. The ultimate aim of this work is to provide insights into gender-based differences in learning from digital games, providing principles and guidance for other researchers and game designers in developing and revising digital learning games. Thus, the project has the potential to transfer Decimal Point?s success with girls? learning outcomes to other digital learning games and advance knowledge on the multidimensionality of gender. Furthermore, findings will allow investigators to revise both games and make them available to thousands of late elementary and middle school students across the country. Even during this project, approximately 1,950 students?including many from districts with diverse populations and low math proficiency?will benefit from learning with Decimal Point and Angle Jungle.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.

Through the Advanced Renewable Energy Technician Education project, LTC will address the skills gaps and unmet demand for renewable energy technicians in Wisconsin.  Working with a Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT) they will identify opportunities to implement training in solar and/or energy storage that would augment an existing wind energy program.  The strategy of including additional credentials in other energy dependent trainings, such as HVAC, will increase the number of students that are prepared to interact with the growing and evolving renewable energy sector.  The goals of the program are to (1) establish a renewable energy BILT to address entry level employment skills and workforce gaps that can be addressed by LTC, (2) develop solar energy instructional labs and provide professional development for faculty to support enhanced renewable energy offerings, and (3) develop learner-focused and culturally responsive curriculum to attract and produce renewable energy technicians that are representative of the diversity of LTC?s service area.<br/><br/>The BILT will work with LTC to conduct a gap analysis and determine the knowledge, skills, and abilities needed for solar and energy storage technicians.

Neuromorphic devices based on conventional semiconductor components are power-hungry. Therefore, new types of components are needed for neuromorphic signal processing. One such promising component is a spin torque nano-oscillator that consists of a magnetic and a non-magnetic metallic layer, electric current flowing in the non-magnetic layer generates microwave electric signal in the magnetic layer. The goal of this research project is to significantly improve energy efficiency of spin torque nano-oscillator via demonstration of a new method of microwave signal generation by electric current that flows in the magnetic layer rather than the non-magnetic layer. It is expected that the proposed method will reduce power consumption of spin torque nano-oscillators by over 90 percent thereby enabling the advancement in computer technology. Graduate and undergraduate students, including persons from underrepresented groups, will be trained in device nanofabrication and characterization techniques. This will contribute to training of the qualified workforce needed for reestablishing the United States leadership in semiconductor chip development and manufacturing.

Fundamental understanding of spin-orbit torques is crucial for the development of these devices. In this project, a new class of spin-orbit torques ? universal self-generated spin-orbit torques in ferromagnetic metals will be studied. These torques are self-generated because they are applied to magnetization of the ferromagnet in which they are produced, and are universal because their presence is expected in all types of ferromagnetic metals independent of their crystal structure. The torques will be measured by spin-torque ferromagnetic resonance in nanowire- and nanocross-based structures prepared using e-beam lithography from epitaxial and polycrystalline magnetic multilayers deposited by magnetron sputtering.  Two major types of self-generated torques, anomalous Hall torque and planar Hall torque, will be studied, and ferromagnetic systems maximizing the magnitude of these torques for technological applications will be determined. To illustrate the transformative potential of the novel torques, highly energy-efficient phase-locked arrays of spin torque nano-oscillators will be demonstrated. Potential of these devices for neuromorphic signal processing will be evaluated. Operation of such spin torque oscillator arrays in zero magnetic field will be demonstrated in structures with interfacial and strain-induced magnetic anisotropy. Energy efficiency of spin torque nano-oscillators driven by universal self-generated spin-orbit torques will be compared to that of spin torque nano-oscillators driven by spin-orbit torques from topological insulators and Weyl semimetals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The experimental validation of theoretical models that describe unconventional forms of high temperature superconductivity or the realization of atomically thin switchable wires holds the promise to streamline and accelerate computer chips while simultaneously reducing their growing energy demand. Professor Fischer and his team will leverage their expertise in bottom-up synthesis, custom polymerization techniques, and advanced scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) and spectroscopy (STS) to rationally design, manufacture, and characterize the exotic quantum phenomena emerging form electron-electron interactions in graphene nanoribbons. The synthetic products are expected to exhibit novel physical properties that extend far beyond the parent 2D graphene, such as highly tunable band gaps, photoemission, delocalized spin-states, coherent magnetic spin-chains, symmetry protected topological states, and even metallic band structures, all tailored by real space structural parameters including among others width, symmetry, edge termination, and doping.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The resulting interior rainwater damage and extended periods of loss in building functionality can have substantial adverse effects on the socio-economic systems within and surrounding urban communities. Past studies of damage after high wind events have recognized that more than 80% of glass breakage was caused by windborne debris (such as broken glass pieces and materials from neighboring buildings) rather than direct wind pressure loading the glass. Appropriate cost-effective solutions begin with a comprehensive understanding of this vulnerability. However, the highly turbulent urban wind field around densely clustered buildings significantly complicates the accurate modeling and prediction of windborne debris transport and impact. This project will model the underlying physical process of the debris impact on clustered urban buildings through a combination of 1) a novel wind tunnel test program at the NSF-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI)  boundary layer wind tunnel at the University of Florida, 2) data-driven computer simulation approaches, and 3) physics-based models of debris origin, flight, and impact. The result will be a new debris damage vulnerability assessment platform that enables risk-consistent efforts to reduce wind damage to the urban building envelope. Concurrent with the research, an interactive augmented reality tool will be developed to visualize the three-dimensional flow around building clusters and debris flight trajectory. This will be the centerpiece of a summer program that exposes high school students from underrepresented groups to engineering and encourages STEM career paths.  Data generated by this project will be archived and made publicly available in the NHERI Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). <br/><br/>This research project will advance the understanding and modeling of the underlying physics of debris transport in urban winds through explicit modeling of complex urban flow features and debris flight trajectories around building clusters. This will directly address the current knowledge gap present in modeling of urban windborne debris hazard mechanisms. New wind tunnel experimental techniques will enable the project team to capture three-dimensional urban wind fields and debris trajectories, resulting in first-of-its-kind data necessary for developing the data-driven wind field models and systematically validating numerical trajectory models for complex urban winds. A novel integration between the wind tunnel experiments and data-driven modeling will be developed through active learning to efficiently predict wind fields for generic building clusters where wind tunnel data is not available. A probabilistic uncertainty quantification procedure will be developed to evaluate windborne debris damage risk through rigorous propagation of uncertainties from debris sources, urban wind fields, debris trajectory, and impact models. The outcome of this project will enable assessment and improvement of hurricane resilience for urban building clusters, which is a significant research gap present in community resilience planning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the impact of CUREs on student success parameters has been widely demonstrated in research intensive 4-year institutions, little is known of the benefits of CUREs in community colleges and other 2-year educational institutions, specifically those with significant percentages of underserved students, such as HSI community colleges. This conference will provide a platform to discuss lessons learned, to evaluate strategies for improvement, and to identify and provide effective tools to 2-year HSI institutions that are considering the introduction of CUREs in their programs while documenting the needs, barriers, successes, and benefits associated with CURE implementation in STEM HSI community college courses. Conference outcomes will include: equity-minded models for CURE design, implementation, and assessment in line with the needs of HSIs; partnership and collaborative strategies among 4-year colleges and urban and rural 2-year colleges for industry engagement in CURE design and execution; improved understanding of high impact practices in STEM teaching and learning; improved understanding of what constitutes cultural relevance in HSIs; and best practices for improving the success rate of HSIs in obtaining external funding to support high impact educational interventions.<br/><br/>The conference aims to lay a foundation for understanding methodology, benefits and challenges of CURE implementation in HSI CCs, and for establishing strategies of efficient collaboration between 4-year universities, rural and urban community colleges, industry, and community organizations in order to improve the quality of education of underserved student populations. The conference will build on NSF-funded University of Arizona HSI Conference: Transforming STEM Education in Hispanic Serving Institutions - Regional Insights from the Southwest (NSF DUE 1748526) and Central Arizona College HSI Conference: Transforming STEM Education at Rural Hispanic-Serving Institutions Across the Nation (NSF DUE 1940949) and will increase knowledge and understanding of the specific challenges and opportunities that introducing high impact educational strategies such as CUREs represent for STEM undergraduate education at 2-year HSIs and how to better serve the needs of students. The conference will generate a report with conference outcomes, recommendations, and resources. Conference results will be disseminated to governmental agencies and higher education organizations via appropriate educational research journals, presentations at regional and national conferences, and institutional social media outlets. Conference findings will inform funding priorities for high impact educational interventions in HSIs, and provide effective models for student engagement and collaboration with industry and other community organizations, ultimately impacting career preparedness of students attending HSIs.

The host institution for the fellowship is Harvard University, and the sponsoring scientist is Dr. Hong-Tzer Yau.<br/><br/>The project's goal is to study the structure of eigenvectors of operators on graphs. The PI will work in three research directions: deduce eigenvector and eigenvalue statistics such as the number of nodal domains of random and semi-random graphs using the combinatorial structure of the graph to prove eigenvector delocalization; bound the number of eigenvalues near the edge of the spectrum for operators on graphs and manifolds using PI's prior research; and generalize known results in quantum ergodicity to graph families with arbitrary limits to further elucidate the connection between eigenvector statistics of a graph family and those of the infinite limit. PI's broadening participation activities are two-fold. One, the PI will leverage his experience as a lead instructor at the associate degree program at San Quentin State Prison, to teach and introduce a more advanced curriculum in the college programs at prisons in Massachusetts, that have a high population of racial minorities. This project aims to directly help those who are incarcerated learn higher level math and thereby gain agency.

The appearance of such rare events may be understood by investigating specific mechanisms arising from the interaction between the components constituting the system. It turns out that a large class of functions in number theory are formidable models to extend the current theory of extreme value statistics. The aim of this project is to develop new probabilistic techniques to describe at various scales the fine statistics of extrema of number-theoretic functions. These techniques will then be applied to related problems in physics and mathematics. The project will provide research training opportunities for undergraduate students and graduate students in computer programming, data science and mathematics.<br/><br/>More precisely, the Riemann zeta function (and to a larger extent the Dirichlet L-functions) is a fundamental function in number theory as it encodes the distribution of prime numbers among the integers. Large values of such functions in particular contain information about the location of the primes, yet they remain poorly understood. This research project builds on recent progress to describe the large values of the zeta function in short intervals. The current project aims at developing new probabilistic techniques to describe the precise statistics of the large values of the zeta function as the size of the observation interval is varied.  In particular, the research carried out in this project is expected to reveal new hybrid statistics at small scales. The project also seeks to extend the techniques to Dirichlet L-functions, where few results are currently available. The ultimate goal is to build better tools of extreme value theory. The interdisciplinary nature of the project is expected to produce new theoretical and numerical tools in probability as well as in analytic number theory.

Study of various spatial and non-spatial random graph models, stochastic spatial models, and stochastic processes taking place on random graphs, and network-based algorithms are key to these efforts. Although these problems have received significant attention in the literature, rigorous analysis and foundational work is needed in many areas to have reliable results and to cope with upcoming challenges and the complexity of real-world data. This research addresses several theoretical and some empirical challenges involving a wide class of questions arising in physics, social sciences, and biosciences. Specific research areas that would benefit from this research include determining functional connectivity within neural networks in brains, pandemic management, pest control strategies, and the evolution of social interactions. This research will provide new insights into the mechanistic underpinning of the underlying complex structures and associated covariates on different social and biological phenomena which are the central objective of research in many disciplines. This analysis will help scientists to understand experimental and observational data in biosciences and social sciences and develop suitable control strategies.  Community detection for temporal networks would enhance the understanding of brain function across multiple spatial and temporal scales. The proposed work also has significant potential to increase our capacity to develop efficient and cost-effective intervention strategies to mitigate some of the most potentially damaging and fastest-spreading invasive epidemics of humans, livestock, and plants (including wheat, soybean, citrus, and hop).  To guarantee that the results are relevant to scientists, parts of the project will be carried out in collaboration with scientists of different fields. Presentations on the relevant research will be given in stakeholder meetings and community outreach events. Undergraduate and graduate students will be involved in the research activities at the intersection of mathematics and other disciplines. Opportunities to learn theoretical and empirical analysis of various probabilistic models, and interactions with scientists will enhance their ability to work at the interface between mathematics and various related areas. <br/> <br/>One of the primary goals of this project is to understand and analyze different structural properties and limiting behavior of various spatial and non-spatial random graph models, and several stochastic dynamics taking place on graphs. The random graph models include open clusters of percolation and related models, multi-layer, and temporal network models. Percolation models originated in the physics literature as a model for a porous medium. There are many useful tools and a well-developed theory for studying the percolation models on two-dimensional lattices. However, for higher dimensional lattices, several key aspects, including the near-critical regime and the behavior of the model in subgraphs such as sectors, are poorly understood. This project will address some of these issues. Multi-layer networks are natural models for numerous datasets arising in various scientific fields, including genomics, biomedical sciences, neuroscience, economics, sociology, ecology, epidemiology, and technological networks. Depending on the context, various parametric probabilistic models have been used for the formation of multi-layer, multiplex, and temporal networks. For the estimation of those parameters from data, and for model selection purposes, it is very important to understand the behavior of some key functionals (e.g., subgraph counts or the concentration of aggregated adjacency matrices). These functionals will be analyzed for a wide variety of temporal network models, particularly where the snapshots have some correlation structure. The stochastic dynamics include some important variants of the standard models for infection spreading and opinion evolution in presence of additional restrictions (e.g., temporary isolation). The project also includes studying several theoretical and empirical aspects (e.g., bounds for detectability threshold, efficient detection algorithms) of various detection problems, which includes detection of anomalous structures, community detection from a correlated sequence of networks, detection of the source of the epidemic. The rigorous analyses of the models discussed above will require the development of novel mathematical techniques and research tools. These techniques and tools would be instrumental to obtain a deeper understanding of a broader class of random structures and dynamics arising in multiple scientific disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One example is the problem of water freezing into ice, where the interface of ice and water is determined by the solution of the heat equation in the water region (the distribution of temperature). This project is focused on problems whose solutions have very little regularity. For instance, when water freezes into ice, the resulting ice crystal is expected to form a fractal-like structure on its boundary. Another example is tumor growth, where the boundary of the tumor develops irregularity due to the search for regions of high nutrients. The project is aimed at providing a better understanding of the properties of the solutions to such problems and provide a framework for developing accurate numerical simulations. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The presence of lower-dimensional structures is ubiquitous in the physical literature, either as a boundary of a domain or a singular part of an evolution. Many problems in nonlinear partial differential equations which are otherwise well understood pose significant challenges when they are coupled with a moving interface, even in seemingly simple settings. Besides the nonlinearity, the difficulty of the problem lies in its nonlocality, in the sense that the behavior of solutions depends on the global geometry of the free boundary. Dynamic free boundary problems face an additional difficulty coming from the lack of a priori regularity of the free boundaries. By studying the proposed problems, the Principal Investigator (PI) aims to develop general methods to deal with such difficulties.

The methods developed in this project are based on newly available data collection strategies made possible by the high prevalence of online access among homeless persons via free Wi-Fi through smartphones, free computers in libraries, and other programs. This study examines the demographics (age, gender, race/ethnicity) of the online and offline homeless populations and their social relationships to understand their impact on the timing and longevity of homelessness. It contributes to research by improving the estimation of hard-to-reach homeless populations and by increasing understanding of the social support mechanisms that affect the duration of homelessness. Findings will inform decision makers and healthcare leaders about best methods for counting people experiencing homelessness for resource allocation, best practices for disseminating information, and new strategies centered around social support networks.<br/><br/>This research concentrates on a US region that contains a large portion of people experiencing homelessness, with targeted samples in a few cities.  The study integrates recent developments in survey sampling and estimation to obtain the demographics and social network data from online sources to compare with offline samples, including the Housing and Urban Development Point-in-Time population count. Novel uses of new and old strategies for measuring hard-to-reach populations are employed through four methods: two methods for online sampling (generalized network scale-up methods and network sampling) and two methods for in-person sampling (respondent driven sampling and space-based sampling). These are compared against the current federal standard Point in Time count. The project leverages the resulting data by extending spatial network models -- which have been shown to provide insight into the networks of people experiencing homelessness -- to fully understand the effects of geography and demographics on the social network structure of people experiencing homelessness and its resultant impact on the timing and duration of homelessness. Results of this study provide needed information on the spatial dimension of homelessness and new statistical network methods for providing update-able simulation models for diffusion of information (online and offline) and disease (offline) through homeless communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project studies the relationship between the geometry and arithmetic in the one-dimensional case of algebraic curves.  Broadly, this project will investigate the possible explicit realizations of an abstract algebraic curve by polynomial equations (so-called Brill-Noether theory), which informs both the geometry of the curve, as well as its arithmetic of solutions over bounded extensions of the rational numbers. The project includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students and work with members of underrepresented groups. <br/><br/>Specifically, the PI will initiate the arithmetic Brill-Noether theory program to elucidate the structure of the rational points on Brill-Noether loci in the Picard variety of a curve.  This has applications to determining the low degree points on curves defined over number fields.  The PI will also investigate analogues of the classic Brill-Noether theorem when the curve is special in moduli due to a low degree realization in projective space.  In particular, when the curve has a low degree map to the projective line, the PI will study the relationship with affine permutations and the affine Grassmannian.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polymers?macromolecular constituents of plastics and rubber materials? are essential and ubiquitous in our daily lives: from food packaging to clothing to vehicle parts.  The vast majority of plastics that are currently being produced contain predominantly carbon atoms along the main polymer backbone.  Meanwhile, further developing the chemistry associated with systems containing nitrogen-rich polymer backbones is critically needed. This improved control over their assembly, folding, thermodynamic and dielectric properties, as well as catalytic activity.  These concepts are illustrated well in proteins, which are naturally occurring polymers.  However, incorporation of nitrogen into the polymer backbone is difficult to achieve synthetically, and the majority of current methodologies are non-selective and generally lack structural precision.  In this research, highly active catalysts based on iridium metal will be used in ring-opening polymerization of a variety of carbodiimides to prepare polymers with abundant and precisely positioned nitrogen atoms along the polymer backbone.  Strong emphasis will be placed on detailed kinetic and mechanistic understanding of the catalytic cycle, monomer design, and control over the length of polymer chains.  Complementary computational methods will also be utilized to guide experimental design and understand how these reactions work and how to improve them.  This research provides unique opportunities to educate students in mechanistic analysis, physical organic chemistry, organometallic chemistry and polymer chemistry.  The research will also transform the design and synthesis of academically and industrially relevant nitrogen-rich polymer backbones, opening the door to a deeper understanding of the structure-property relationships in these polymers.  In addition, the team will continue to expand its educational polymer-chemistry focused program that targets K-12 students and science teachers with a focus on talent pools that remain under-resourced and underrepresented in the STEM fields.  This program includes virtual and in-person science demonstrations at K-12 schools in Chapel Hill and will expand to include Durham, NC.  These efforts will be instrumental to nurturing within future generations of students an appreciation for and identification with polymer science research.<br/><br/>This research will focus on carbodiimide ring-opening metathesis polymerization (CDI ROMP) catalyzed by iridium guanidinate complexes for the precise synthesis of nitrogen-rich polymer backbones.  The first objective will focus on the investigation of the reaction mechanism through a combination of experimental and theoretical tools. The following aspects will be explored: verification of chain growth, the type of metathesis process, energetics of the carbodiimide-iridium coordination, the nature of energy barrier of turnover limiting step, and the geometry of the corresponding transition state. Controlled and living CDI ROMP will be developed in the second objective and utilized to prepare block copolymers.  Computational and experimental studies will shed light on the effect of ancillary cyclopentadienyl ligand structure in the iridium catalyst on the backbiting/chain transfer process.  The last objective will focus on the derivatization of precise main-chain polycarbodiimides to form libraries of other classes of nitrogen-rich polymer backbones, including polyureas, polythioureas, polyguanidines, polyamidines and polyamidinates.  The mechanism of insertion/elimination in this research is fundamentally different from traditional metathesis of C-C bonds that proceeds via cyclo-addition/elimination.  As such, the gained mechanistic insights will be instructive in the future development of other types of metathesis transformations, such as diazene metathesis and ring-closing carbodiimide metathesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emergent collective behaviors resulting from the coordination of autonomous individual entities is a universal and important theme in the natural world. Collective behaviors occur from the level of organisms to the level of cells and organelles. They are observed in the synchronous firing of pacemaker heart cells, the swarming of insects and the schooling of fish. A critical example of the emergence of collective behaviors is the appearance of rhythmic coordinated waves in motile cilia. Cilia are hair-like appendages that enable fluid pumping and locomotion in organisms as varied as microscopic prokaryotes to mammals. They carry out diverse functions such as the removal of contaminants from airways, in hearing or in the transport of an egg from the ovaries for fertilization.  This award will support Dr. Ahmed at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro to synthesize the first chemically powered, individually autonomous, self-propelled artificial cilia, producing a model for biological cilia and open the door for further investigations related to the operation of biological cilia. In addition, the project will present an opportunity for graduate and undergraduate students from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences to partake in novel interdisciplinary research.<br/><br/> <br/>Theoretical work has supported the prevailing hypothesis that coordinated collective waves in cilia emerge as a result of hydrodynamic coupling between autonomous individual cilia. Experimental support of this hypothesis has not yet been demonstrated either within biological systems or artificial cilia. Biological cilia do not offer the flexibility to vary structural parameters to decouple cilia and tease out the mechanistic details of emergence. Artificial cilia offer the flexibility to customize organization and speed to observe the emergence of collective behaviors.  This award will support the synthesis of the first chemically powered, autonomous artificial cilia producing a model for biological cilia, which will represent a significant step forward in the understanding of the emergence of collective behaviors in motile cilia, the efficiency of their motion and the structure-function relationship of various parameters on ciliated swimmers.

Unfortunately, many students with learning disabilities (LD) do not do well in science and, in turn, have limited career opportunities in STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics). For students? with LD, difficulties in science start early, with a large achievement gap between students with LD and typically achieving peers evident by early elementary school. More concerning is that this science achievement discrepancy widens over time. While lower science achievement for students with LD is well documented, little is known about why this disparity exists. We know little about the quality of science instruction students with LD receive during the upper elementary school years when foundational scientific content and practices should be taught. Therefore, this project aims to conduct a large-scale survey and observational study using a nationally representative of U.S. elementary schools to investigate the science education of 4th and 5th graders with LD. The project will provide foundational knowledge on the quality and type of science instruction students with LD receive and how this instruction aligns with effective practices. <br/><br/>Using a crowdsourcing approach, researchers will work with ten different universities to collect and analyze data from 20 schools located across all nine U.S. census districts. This nationwide crowdsourced collaboration will allow for a generalizable sample of U.S. elementary schools and the students with LD educated in these schools. Through teacher surveys, interviews, and direct observations of science instruction, researchers will ascertain a myriad of critical information currently unknown to the field.  The will investigate the time allotted to science instruction in 4th and 5th-grade elementary classrooms across the country and the amount of the allotted time enacted by teachers.  Data collection will consider how often students with LD are present for science instruction, and the science content delivered and curricula used. Further, the team will quantify meaningful engagement (i.e., instructional interactions occurring between teachers and students) of students with LD during science instruction.  They will ascertain if meaningful engagement levels vary by (a) type of science instruction (e.g., didactic, practice-based), (b) quality of science instruction (e.g., alignment with emerging effective practices), and (c) instructional supports (e.g., scaffolded material) provided to students with LD. Further, the team will investigate whether science instructional features are associated with higher achievement for students with LD.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. The program supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent challenges in STEM interest, education, learning and participation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Analysis of graduation data in Advanced Manufacturing credentials by Bluegrass Community & Technical College (BCTC) faculty indicates few women graduate in these fields. BCTC?s three-year Girls Can Too Project will address this problem by educating, recruiting and mentoring 80 middle and high school girls into careers relating to Industrial Maintenance Technology (IMT), a key technical field that supplies highly skilled technicians who install, maintain and repair industrial systems equipment. Project activities will develop awareness and learning activities coupled with mentoring interventions for these middle and high school girls and then recruit 10 to 12 high school girls to enroll in dual credit courses that will prepare them for transfer into the IMT program to earn certificates, diplomas or AAS degrees. Mentoring and support by professional women employed in IMT will provide women enrolled in the IMT program with leadership opportunities as near-peer mentors for the middle and high school students participating in the Girls Can Too Project. The broader impacts of this project include support for girls? engagement and transition into technical fields by strengthening and expanding high school dual credit programs to include IMT preparation courses. The project also supports systemic change in the college?s systems of support, mentoring and industry connections through a female-led mentoring program and a Business and Industry Leadership Team (BILT). The intellectual merit of the project rest on its contribution to a growing field of study that assesses the value of mentoring and support interventions to address gender disparities in STEM fields. College administrators will review project successes and adapt or expand activities to grow enrollment in other technical programs with similar gender disparities so the college can build a diverse skilled technical workforce.<br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to recruit and retain more women in Industrial Maintenance Technology by increasing awareness and providing learning opportunities and mentoring beginning in middle school. Girls and young women will gain access to relevant dual credit courses in high school and have high levels of contact with faculty and industry professionals who are women. Each year, project directors expect 80 students from middle and high schools to participate in program activities supported by two faculty who will lead the program of interventions and support that encompass Saturday engagements at the college?s Advanced Manufacturing campus in Georgetown Kentucky and summer learning experiences that engages them with hands-on activities related to industrial maintenance. High school students who participate in the program will have the opportunity to take four technology-related dual credit courses to prepare for enrollment in the college?s IMT program. IMT faculty will add to their pedagogical skills those strategies needed to engage a more diverse classroom by participating in BCTC?s Cultural Competency course, a semester-long course developed and offered by the college to advance the goals of equity and diversity in teaching and learning. This cultural competency knowledge will be integrated into the IMT classroom to update the curriculum and better meet the needs of a more diverse student body.

Uncertainty and overconfidence, respectively, may characterize the phishing vulnerabilities of persons with less versus more computer literacy. The project team is studying phishing vulnerabilities, testing whether they characterize people with different expertise and confidence, and deploying interventions designed to address differently-caused phishing vulnerabilities. The main interventions to be evaluated include psychological inoculation, whereby people are exposed to repeated, weakened, and harmless phishing experiences, and educational techniques in the form of anti-phishing instructions. <br/> <br/>The first stage in the project is testing, through controlled experiments, whether people with varying computer literacy, and varying confidence, differ in their approach to phishing avoidance. The next stage is to study the impact of different interventions, including variations on psychological inoculation and anti-phishing instructions, and test how those interventions are associated with persons who vary in their expertise and confidence. A third step will be to develop and evaluate alerts that could be triggered by potential phishing attacks.

Most metal-catalyzed processes rely on so-called ""polar reactivity"" wherein chemical reactions involve changes of two electrons at a time. Guided by the emerging concept of ""metalloradical catalysis"" in which changes instead happen one electron at a time, Professor Zhang and his team of coworkers are developing new catalytic systems that take advantage of the unique features of radical reactions. In comparison with the typical need for rare and expensive metals to mediate two-electron polar reactions, the one electron metalloradical reactions of interest are carried out with catalysts based on earth-abundant and inexpensive transition metals such as cobalt. As such, the funded research project addresses important issues of sustainability in fine chemical manufacture and with potential long term benefits for biology, medicine, and materials. The broader impacts of the funded project extend to the promotion of science among the general public by supporting the Zhang group as they provide educational resources for K-12 teachers and stimulate interest in STEM (science, technology, engineering and medicine)  conducting outreach activities. As part of these efforts, educational web-based material entitled ""The Colors of Life"" will be created and made available to the public, and opportunities will be provided for high school students and teachers, as well as undergraduate students, to gain first-hand research experiences in the laboratory.<br/><br/>This project focuses on the establishment of metalloradical catalysis as a fundamentally new approach for controlling the reactivity and stereoselectivity of radical reactions. Metalloradical systems based on cobalt(II) complexes of chiral porphyrins will be developed to harness the full potential of homolytic radical chemistry. These new catalytic radical processes, which are both mechanistically distinctive and operationally straightforward, will serve as valuable synthetic tools for the construction of organic compounds, including biologically important natural products and pharmaceutically interesting small molecules. The concept of metalloradical catalysis, which aims at the full exploration of homolysis as a fundamental platform for bond-breaking and -making, will have a far-reaching impact on organic synthesis and it is likely to stimulate the development of further new synthetic methods based on radical chemistry. The further exploration of cobalt-based metalloradical catalysis has the potential to guide the development of new metalloradical catalyst systems based on different combinations of open-shell metal ions and chiral ligands that can catalyze a broad range of stereoselective radical reactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The study will explore how and why Decimal Point has, over the course of several experiments spanning multiple years, consistently produced a learning advantage for female students. In doing so, investigators will identify principles regarding the relationship between gender and game features that can be shared with game developers and used in other games, starting with Angle Jungle.<br/><br/>This work will go beyond the traditional gender binary of male and female, analyzing multiple dimensions of gender, including gender identity (e.g., how much students feel like a boy, a girl, both, neither), gender typicality (e.g., How much students like to do the same things as other girls [boys], How much students feel they look like boys [girls]), and gender-typed interests, activities, and traits (e.g., how much a student feels affectionate or adventurous). The study will also investigate two pathways hypothesized to lead to gender differences: first, that the playful features of the games reduce the saliency of the math content, making it less likely to cue math stereotype threat (the stereotype threat hypothesis); and second, that the games? thematic details are more appealing to learners who identify (more) as females, making the games more engaging for them compared to learners who identify (more) as boys (the engagement hypothesis). In Year 1, educational data mining will be used to infer students? cognitive and affective processes while playing Decimal Point and compare data to the distinct processes predicted by these two pathways. In Year 2, investigators will assess whether the hypothesized pathways and gender differences replicate in the context of Angle Jungle. In Year 3, hypotheses will be further tested by manipulating Decimal Point?s emphasis on math content in one version of the game and enjoyment and playful features in another. The project will compare learning outcomes between the two versions to more deeply explore the stereotype threat and engagement hypotheses. The ultimate aim of this work is to provide insights into gender-based differences in learning from digital games, providing principles and guidance for other researchers and game designers in developing and revising digital learning games. Thus, the project has the potential to transfer Decimal Point?s success with girls? learning outcomes to other digital learning games and advance knowledge on the multidimensionality of gender. Furthermore, findings will allow investigators to revise both games and make them available to thousands of late elementary and middle school students across the country. Even during this project, approximately 1,950 students?including many from districts with diverse populations and low math proficiency?will benefit from learning with Decimal Point and Angle Jungle.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development. The program supports the accumulation of robust evidence to inform efforts to understand, build theory to explain, and suggest intervention and innovations to address persistent.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hartgerink of William Marsh Rice University is studying   self-assembly of small popypeptides that structurally mimic collagen.  Collagen is the most abundant protein in the human body and plays major roles in wound healing, tissue regeneration, cancer metastasis and the overall integrity of both soft and hard tissues.  This protein is composed of three polypeptide chains that are wrapped together in a tight triple helix.  Each polypeptide chain consists of sequences of amino acids that are linked by a particular kind of chemical bond called a peptide bond or link.  When counting all amino acids, collagen is a very large macromolecule with molecular weight approaching 300,000 g/mol.  This size limits the access to atomic level information about how the triple helix in collagen is assembled and formed in solution.  To circumvent this problem, the research team will focus on smaller fragments from two different regions in collagen, namely ?stem? where the six triple helices bundle together and the ?branches? where the triple helices splay outward from one another making independent triple helices.  Polypeptides chains from these two regions will be synthesized and thoroughly characterized using a suite of sophisticated chemical techniques.  A computational algorithm SCEPTTr will be utilized to aid in the experimental design and identify the minimal sequences of amino acids needed for self-assembly.  Diverse sequences of the branch region have the potential to provide well folded triple helical systems that will expand understanding of triple helix stabilization.  The stem region, on the other hand, could offer opportunity to determine the atomic level structure of parallel packed triple helices.  The research will provide an outstanding basis for undergraduate and graduate educational programs because it is multi-disciplinary in nature and combines chemical design and synthesis with traditional structural biology and medical application.  Outreach programs will recruit high school students and their teachers in underserved communities to participate in research over the summer and develop exciting curriculum that integrates this work.  SCEPTTr will be enhanced and continued to be distributed to the community with the aim to assist in the design of larger peptide mimics.  <br/><br/>This research will focus on the self-assembly of collagen-like octadecamers based on the stem region of C1q and related Defense Collagens.  In the first objective, Collagen Mimetic Peptides (CMPs) with sequences taken from the branch region of Defense Collagens will be prepared. These chemically diverse sequences will be selected for self-assembly studies because they show a tendency to fold.  Peptides will be prepared by solid phase peptide synthesis using standard Fmoc chemistry and characterized for their thermal stability.  Key pairwise interactions will also be independently examined.  This stability data will be used to improve the range of sequences accurately modeled by SCEPTTr.  Biologically derived sequences will be stabilized through covalent capture and tested for their ability to bind known ligands of Defense Collagens.  In the last objective, CMPs with sequences taken from the stem region of Defense Collagens will be synthesized and oligomerized to form octadecamers.  A sequence study will be performed to assess the minimal regions required for octadecamer self-assembly.  Well folded octadecamers will be further characterized by NMR and X-ray crystallography. Helical bundles will be stabilized by covalent capture and tested for their ability to bind relevant ligands. This project, if successful, will improve general understanding of the multi-step, hierarchical self-assembly of collagen and provide an assessment of CMPs for potential biomedical applications.  In addition to the fundamental biophysical knowledge gained from this structural investigation, the critical role that Defense Collagens play in the innate immune response and the overall orchestration of inflammation and immunity will create many opportunities for preparing novel peptide-based drugs and biopolymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Millions of adults live with neurological disorders, brain injury, mental illness, limb loss or paralysis. We face a critical need for accessible technologies that can more effectively address the care and rehabilitation needs of these patients. However, innovation in neurotechnology faces several challenges: The pace of innovation exceeds the rate of evaluation for acceptable performance; standards and regulatory science for the rigorous validation of safety, efficacy, and long-term reliability of neurotechnology are lagging; lack of synergistic, sustained industry-university partnerships impede the transfer of novel technologies to the market; current technologies are costly, limiting their cost-effectiveness in enhancing treatment and overcoming disabilities; and opportunities for workforce development are limited as the need to train new generations of physicians and engineers in emerging technologies steadily increases.<br/><br/>The Industry-University Cooperative Research Center for Building Reliable Advances and Innovations in Neurotechnology (IUCRC BRAIN) will address the above challenges. The Center?s vision is built on a convergent research approach to the design and validation of reliable, ethical, patient-centered neurotechnologies and their use in understanding neural systems. BRAIN leverages wide-ranging expertise from neural, cognitive and rehabilitation engineering to neurorobotics, neuromodulation, and ethical artificial intelligence to enhance the rate of development and empirical validation of new neurotechnologies through partnerships with industry and other strategic partners while developing a highly skilled workforce; evaluating the impact of these technologies on quality of life; and integrating knowledge across disciplines ?such as the humanities with neurotechnologies ? to understand collective intelligence, and augment physical and cognitive capabilities. <br/><br/>The Center?s mission is multifold: to accelerate the progress of science and advance the national health by transferring neurotechnology to end users and to promote access to science, technology, engineering, and math by broadening new participation and retaining current participants.

The type of reactivity being explored complements established methods for organic synthesis and it is anticipated to streamline the manufacture of pharmaceutical agents, agrochemicals, and other useful advanced materials. In conjunction with catalyst discovery efforts, this research will target new strategies to precisely control the atomic connectivity and three-dimensional structure of complex products obtained from polarized polyenes. Crucially, and because these starting materials are capable of reacting in a variety of different ways, the research promises important fundamental advances in the area of divergent chemical pathways management. A demographically diverse group of undergraduate and graduate students within the  Mohr laboratory will conduct the funded research. These individuals will gain valuable technical and scientific skills of relevance to potential future careers in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-based workforce. The broader impacts of the project will include outreach activities conducted by the Mohr research team as they engage with Chicago-area K-12 students to promote science education. In addition, and to complement these and other ongoing efforts to broaden participation, Dr. Mohr actively recruits undergraduate students belonging to underrepresented groups to become involved in chemical research in his laboratory at UIC, a minority-serving institution (MSI).<br/><br/>The development of efficient strategies for the assembly of polyfunctional molecules is facilitated by gaining new insights into the fundamental reactivity of progressively more complex intermediates. It is from this standpoint that the funded project focuses on the development of a suite of gamma-selective transformations from conjugated dienol systems [e.g., 1-(tert-butyldimethylsilyloxy)-1,3-cyclohexadiene], each example of which may provide a useful new synthetic tool for the elaboration of desirable target classes. Specific aims of the research include: (1) development of copper- and nickel-catalyzed stereoselective C?C bond forming reactions through examination of novel chiral ligand and chiral auxiliary designs, (2) expansion of metal-catalyzed coupling techniques to include problematic primary halide coupling partners, (3) examination of single-electron oxidation of dienol ethers to generate novel radical cation intermediates exhibiting regioselective reactivity, and (4) exploration of transition metal-catalyzed, site-selective C?heteroatom bond formation in polyene systems. Ultimately, the research is expected to help build a growing understanding of the basic factors that influence and control regio- and stereo-selectivity in polyene systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A typical number theoretic question is to find all the whole number solutions of some equation of interest. By synthesizing the topological and algebraic properties of the graphs of these equations, one obtains a mathematical object (a collection of mathematical data) called a Galois representation which encodes many of the properties of the originating equation. The mathematician Robert Langlands has developed a series of conjectures (or mathematical predictions) which anticipate a very close relationship between these Galois representations and some very different kinds of group representations, known as automorphic representations, which arise out of mathematical analysis.  The goal of this project is to make progress on Langlands's conjectures by placing them in various more structural geometric frameworks, and then to use geometric methods and perspectives to establish relationships between these two different kinds of representations (Galois and automorphic). The project provides training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The goal of the research project is to investigate both local and global aspects of the arithmetic Langlands program.

These investigations are closely related to the problem of extending the Taylor--Wiles--Kisin patching method to the residually reducible case, and to the study of the Eisenstein part of cohomology, and Dr. Emerton will pursue these relationships, especially in the context of odd two-dimensional representations, which are connected to the cohomology of modular curves.  Dr. Emerton will also develop a new approach to the mod p deformation theory of crystalline local-at-p Galois representations, via their relationship to prismatic F-crystals and gauges.

Electron donor and acceptor aromatic molecules contain conjugated pi-systems that allow electron delocalization through bonds via resonance as well as through space when they are cofacially pi-stacked like a deck of cards. In addition, electroactive aromatic molecules often absorb and emit light, thereby displaying fascinating optical properties. When electron rich (pi-donors) and deficient (pi-acceptor) pi-systems are organized in an alternating fashion, their ability to conduct electrical current is further accentuated due to facile through-space electron delocalization from the donor to the acceptor units via charge-transfer and even partial electron transfer interactions. In this research conducted by the Saha group at Clemson, repeating electron donor and acceptor units will be stacked by encapsulating them within specifically designed supramolecular containers. The containers will be constructed using platinum metal ions and organic linkers to precisely control their dimensions and electronic and optical properties. As such, they will accommodate pi-donor and acceptor units of different sizes to regulate their three-dimensional ordering and orientation. The results generated by this work can potentially to lead to new class of semiconductors, transistors, light-harvesting systems, and electrochromic and thermochromic materials. Dr. Saha will work to train and mentor diverse groups of undergraduate and graduate students, provide research experience to high school seniors through Clemson?s EUREKA! program, and offer career guidance and motivation to largely minority students from Georgia Southern University to pursue graduate education through a ?Be a Grad Student for a Day? initiative. In addition,  local outreach programs at Beck Academy Middle School and Roper Mountain Science Museum will be conducted to engage K-12 students and encourage them to consider pursuing higher education in STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) fields.<br/><br/>This research will focus on the synthesis, assembly, and structure?function relationship studies of robust supramolecular pi-donor/acceptors arrays using redox-active multicomponent metallacycles, metal-organic cages, and daisy chain coordination polymers as supramolecular containers that can encapsulate redox-complementary guest pi-systems inside their cavities. Tricomponent rectangular metallacycles and tetragonal prismatic metallacages consisting of two parallel redox-active faces and orthogonal linkers with variable lengths connected by heteroligated platinum corners will be employed as supramolecular containers to encapsulate redox-complementary guests. The containers and their guest-inclusion complexes will be coordinatively linked to assemble daisy-chain polymers. Emphasis will be placed on controlling the formation of discrete pi-donor/acceptor stacks through systematic variations of the cavity size of the hosts and the redox properties of the hosts and guests. The structures and compositions of inclusion complexes will be determined using a suite of crystallographic, spectroscopic, and electron microscopic techniques. Systematic studies will be conducted to examine how the host/guest and guest/guest charge-transfer and electron-transfer interactions will influence the color, emission, bandgaps, and charge transport capability of the resulting inclusion complexes.

The disease management strategies informed by models of vector-borne diseases (such as diseases spread by mosquitoes) led to the elimination of malaria from the United States and other countries. However, malaria continues to have an enormous impact on resource-challenged regions of the world, while other existing and emerging vector-borne diseases such as West Nile Virus, Dengue Virus, and Zika Virus continue to impact both advanced and resource-challenged economies. A shortcoming of many existing modeling approaches is the absence of an explicit connection between economic factors and disease transmission ? two factors that influence each other. In an increasingly connected and complex world, accounting for the synergistic effects of these factors is essential for effective disease control. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic caused sudden economic shifts that affected the progress of malaria control programs, resulting in increases in malaria-related deaths. In collaboration with an ecologist/economist and with an entomologist and a biostatistician from Africa, the investigators will build mathematical tools to bridge this gap, which will be used to inform public health and economic growth policies. The project will train graduate students through involvement in the research. Workshops on feedback between economic and disease systems will train a new generation of undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds on this important topic. This work will also involve students from Africa, a continent that is highly affected by vector-borne diseases. <br/> <br/>Incorporating socio-economic factors into vector-borne disease (VBD) systems is key to identifying new interventions, by unraveling the intertwined relationship between VBD, socio-economic conditions, and transient events. The investigators aim to develop a new mechanistic framework for transient disease dynamics that accounts for feedback between VBDs and economic systems, the impact of fast-slow time scales, and sudden endogenous and exogenous events that shift the economic landscape. Factors including heterogeneous mosquito-biting and insecticide-treated-net (ITN) replacement times, demographic structure, and human behavior in relation to ITN use will be included. For even the simplest economic-VBD model, standard methods for computing basic epidemiological metrics and performing structural identifiability analysis break down. Hence, the investigators also plan to build the mathematical toolbox required to analyze and simulate these coupled systems. Although the framework will be applied to malaria as a prototype VBD using socio-economic and epidemiological data from Kenya, Madagascar, and West Africa to calibrate the parameters and validate the outcomes of the models, it is intended to be robust enough to be applicable to other VBDs. Furthermore, the framework will allow the investigators to realistically answer important public health and economic growth questions, including how to distribute ITNs across connected populations, and how to respond to spontaneous events affecting the economic landscape.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental topic in the field is moduli theory, which aims to construct and study spaces that parametrize all such shapes. For low dimensional shapes such moduli spaces are well understood, but less is known in higher dimensions. Recently, new perspectives from differential geometry have led to the construction of moduli spaces of certain Fano varieties, which are a class of positively curved shapes. The aim of this project is to apply newly developed techniques from the latter construction to the moduli theory of other classes of shapes. The project offers training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>K-stabilty is an algebraic notion introduced by differential geometers to characterize the existence of certain canonical metrics on complex projective varieties. While the notion can be defined for any projective variety, recent research has focused on the case of Fano varieties and culminated in an application to algebraic geometry: the construction of projective moduli spaces parametrizing K-stable Fano varieties. The goal of this project is to use tools from birational geometry and K-stability to construct moduli spaces of other classes of varieties. In particular, the PI will construct certain moduli of K-unstable Fano varieties, motivated by the study of Kahler-Ricci solitons in differential geometry. Next, the PI will develop new approaches for studying moduli of K-trivial varieties.

These perceptions appear to influence female students? interest and performance in math, as well as their pursuit of STEM careers. Given the potential motivational benefits of digital learning games, games might provide a pathway for reducing math anxiety for female students while increasing their self-efficacy and interest in math. This project will explore whether digital learning games can lead to less math anxiety and better learning in female students, while not hurting male student learning. It will study learning with two existing digital learning games: Decimal Point, which teaches foundational math concepts (decimal numbers and operations) to 5th and 6th grade students; and Angle Jungle, which targets a similar age range (4th and 5th graders) and has a similar thematic design (i.e., a game map, cartoon characters), but with different game mechanics, content (angles), and instructional approach. The study will explore how and why Decimal Point has, over the course of several experiments spanning multiple years, consistently produced a learning advantage for female students. In doing so, investigators will identify principles regarding the relationship between gender and game features that can be shared with game developers and used in other games, starting with Angle Jungle.<br/><br/>This work will go beyond the traditional gender binary of male and female, analyzing multiple dimensions of gender, including gender identity (e.g., how much students feel like a boy, a girl, both, neither), gender typicality (e.g., How much students like to do the same things as other girls [boys], How much students feel they look like boys [girls]), and gender-typed interests, activities, and traits (e.g., how much a student feels affectionate or adventurous). The study will also investigate two pathways hypothesized to lead to gender differences: first, that the playful features of the games reduce the saliency of the math content, making it less likely to cue math stereotype threat (the stereotype threat hypothesis); and second, that the games? thematic details are more appealing to learners who identify (more) as females, making the games more engaging for them compared to learners who identify (more) as boys (the engagement hypothesis). In Year 1, educational data mining will be used to infer students? cognitive and affective processes while playing Decimal Point and compare data to the distinct processes predicted by these two pathways. In Year 2, investigators will assess whether the hypothesized pathways and gender differences replicate in the context of Angle Jungle. In Year 3, hypotheses will be further tested by manipulating Decimal Point?s emphasis on math content in one version of the game and enjoyment and playful features in another. The project will compare learning outcomes between the two versions to more deeply explore the stereotype threat and engagement hypotheses. The ultimate aim of this work is to provide insights into gender-based differences in learning from digital games, providing principles and guidance for other researchers and game designers in developing and revising digital learning games. Thus, the project has the potential to transfer Decimal Point?s success with girls? learning outcomes to other digital learning games and advance knowledge on the multidimensionality of gender. Furthermore, findings will allow investigators to revise both games and make them available to thousands of late elementary and middle school students across the country. Even during this project, approximately 1,950 students?including many from districts with diverse populations and low math proficiency?will benefit from learning with Decimal Point and Angle Jungle.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program.

The project will not only advance the science of black holes, but, by developing new mathematical techniques of relevance to other fields of mathematical physics, it promotes the progress of Mathematics and Science in the broadest possible sense. The Principal Investigator (PI) has a strong track record in targeting specific problems with broad appeal in various areas of Partial Differential Equations (PDE). In that sense, the problems considered as part of this project, though specific to the subject at hand, can also be reformulated in other important problems of mathematical physics. The project also fits well with respect to the long term goal of the PI to help create a vibrant scientific community working on mathematical problems connected to these areas. In particular, the project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/> <br/>The project focuses on some of the main open problems concerning black holes such as rigidity, stability, and collapse, with special emphasis being given to the fundamental problem of the stability of the Kerr family. This is a precise, explicit, family of solutions to the Einstein vacuum equations, depending on two parameters (the mass and the angular momentum), on which our theoretical understanding of black holes is based. Thus, the problems mentioned above are not only deep from a mathematical point of view, they also have serious implications in Astrophysics. This is particularly true about the problem of stability, since if the Kerr family were to be found unstable, black holes would be nothing more than mathematical artifacts. The PI interprets these three related problems as mathematical ""tests of reality"" for black holes. All three problems require a deep understanding of the dynamics of the Einstein field equations in a strong gravitational field regime. This is a tall task which can only be achieved by a systematic mathematical analysis of the underlining structure of the problems, using new geometric PDE techniques. The resolution of these problems promotes the progress of Mathematics and Science beyond the subject matter of this particular project. Indeed, it is expected, as it often happened in the past, that some of the techniques developed in connection to these problems will be relevant to other important partial differential equations of mathematical physics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is especially true of symplectic geometry -- the geometry of phase spaces of classical mechanics, where points are ""too small"" to be relevant, and it is more natural to consider objects called Lagrangian submanifolds. These objects and their interactions are encoded by an algebraic structure (or ""non-commutative space"") called the Fukaya category. A remarkable mathematical conjecture inspired by ideas from theoretical physics, ""homological mirror symmetry"", asserts that Fukaya categories are in fact often equivalent to honest (commutative) spaces of the sort studied in algebraic geometry. This research project studies versions of Fukaya categories for symplectic manifolds equipped with one or more (commuting) functions and/or relative to certain directions at infinity. The rich structure of these categories, coming from the additional data, yields new ways of understanding the effect of various geometric constructions on the Fukaya category of a symplectic manifold; this in turn should greatly extend the range of settings in which homological mirror symmetry can be verified. The project will also provide research opportunities for several graduate students and generally aim to make this research area more accessible to the broader mathematical community.<br/><br/> From a technical standpoint, the first goal of this project is to develop a better geometric setup for partially wrapped Fukaya categories as they arise in mirror symmetry, to arrive at a formulation where computations are possible and the expected structural features are manifest. The other main goal is to use these foundations to give a general proof of homological mirror symmetry for (not necessarily Calabi-Yau) complete intersections in toric varieties, and to study canonical bases of their coordinate rings. Finally, this project will also bring conceptual clarity to the field by unifying different proposed constructions of partially wrapped Fukaya categories, finding new instances of functoriality in mirror symmetry, and studying the interplay between geometric constructions and categorical ones.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These fake profiles may use face images to signal human authenticity. Until recently it was possible to identify bad-faith actors via reverse image searches because many fake profiles used stock photos. Recent advances in machine learning-enabled general adversarial networks (GANs) have made it possible to create hyper-realistic faces of people who do not exist and cannot be identified. These faces can be animated and used to cause harm. To help develop more secure and trustworthy cyberspaces, it is critical to understand whether and how human perceivers (alone or with computational aids) can detect real vs. artificial faces, and how their detection strategies and outcomes differ across groups. This project investigates whether the GANs that generate faces are racially biased and whether this bias is manifested in differential detectability of ingroup vs. outgroup faces. <br/><br/>The project tests the hypothesis that GANs are racially biased because the training dataset is itself biased, with White faces (especially White female faces) overrepresented. Furthermore, when tools are created to control what kind of face is generated, these tools may be racially biased as well because they are extracting biased parameters. These biased processes may result in GAN-generated faces that are more detectable to racial minority individuals vs. racial majority individuals. To test these hypotheses, the project is developing a training dataset of diverse faces, with annotations for dimensions of interest such as skin tone and gender.

Academia is spurring ground-breaking research (e.g., deep learning) and industry is validating software and hardware extensively with millions of miles being driven on the roads and in simulation. Yet, by all accounts - we are still years away from full deployment. One of the primary limitations is the presence of events outside `typical' scenarios. These events range from environmental anomalies (e.g., a swerving car), sensor mistakes (e.g., missed detection of a truck) to security challenges (e.g., remote attacks, spoofing of sensors). These events, while typically rare, reduce reliability of self-driving cars to a level that is unacceptable to the consumer. This research program will develop new algorithms, hardware and validated CPS architecture concepts for autonomous systems operating for long periods of time, such as self-driving cars and flying delivery robots. The work will also be applicable to any autonomous system operating in dynamic environments, such as robots operating in public areas and the home. <br/><br/>This research project will develop a holistic CPS architecture for safety assurance and continual performance improvement for autonomous systems operating over long periods of time via probabilistic algorithms, safety guarantees and a secure and agile platform. The technical approach develops three sub-architectures for autonomous CPS systems. A Safety Assured architecture provides probabilistic collision guarantees on secure hardware. A Performance Driven architecture provides robust perception and planning in general conditions, with adaptable algorithms and hardware via dynamic resource allocation. And a Self-Improving architecture works in the background to reason about rare events outside typical scenarios and improve perception and planning algorithms via model learning and software updates. Importantly, by directly working with the inherent coupling between the hardware platform and algorithms, a safety assured CPS architecture will be developed to provide collision avoidance guarantees due to rare events. In addition, adaptive resource allocation on a hardware/software platform along with novel agile algorithms which are adaptable will allow the system to further refine and update inference about the scene and plan options, as well as improve over time. Two experimental testbeds will be used to validate the research. The first is a robot driving in a controlled lab environment in a small-scale city. The second testbed utilizes regularly logged sensor data from a self-driving car to evaluate perception-based mistakes, environmental anomalies, and continual improvement over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These perceptions appear to influence female students? interest and performance in math, as well as their pursuit of STEM careers. Given the potential motivational benefits of digital learning games, games might provide a pathway for reducing math anxiety for female students while increasing their self-efficacy and interest in math. This project will explore whether digital learning games can lead to less math anxiety and better learning in female students, while not hurting male student learning. It will study learning with two existing digital learning games: Decimal Point, which teaches foundational math concepts (decimal numbers and operations) to 5th and 6th grade students; and Angle Jungle, which targets a similar age range (4th and 5th graders) and has a similar thematic design (i.e., a game map, cartoon characters), but with different game mechanics, content (angles), and instructional approach. The study will explore how and why Decimal Point has, over the course of several experiments spanning multiple years, consistently produced a learning advantage for female students. In doing so, investigators will identify principles regarding the relationship between gender and game features that can be shared with game developers and used in other games, starting with Angle Jungle.<br/><br/>This work will go beyond the traditional gender binary of male and female, analyzing multiple dimensions of gender, including gender identity (e.g., how much students feel like a boy, a girl, both, neither), gender typicality (e.g., How much students like to do the same things as other girls [boys], How much students feel they look like boys [girls]), and gender-typed interests, activities, and traits (e.g., how much a student feels affectionate or adventurous). The study will also investigate two pathways hypothesized to lead to gender differences: first, that the playful features of the games reduce the saliency of the math content, making it less likely to cue math stereotype threat (the stereotype threat hypothesis); and second, that the games? thematic details are more appealing to learners who identify (more) as females, making the games more engaging for them compared to learners who identify (more) as boys (the engagement hypothesis). In Year 1, educational data mining will be used to infer students? cognitive and affective processes while playing Decimal Point and compare data to the distinct processes predicted by these two pathways. In Year 2, investigators will assess whether the hypothesized pathways and gender differences replicate in the context of Angle Jungle. In Year 3, hypotheses will be further tested by manipulating Decimal Point?s emphasis on math content in one version of the game and enjoyment and playful features in another. The project will compare learning outcomes between the two versions to more deeply explore the stereotype threat and engagement hypotheses. The ultimate aim of this work is to provide insights into gender-based differences in learning from digital games, providing principles and guidance for other researchers and game designers in developing and revising digital learning games. Thus, the project has the potential to transfer Decimal Point?s success with girls? learning outcomes to other digital learning games and advance knowledge on the multidimensionality of gender. Furthermore, findings will allow investigators to revise both games and make them available to thousands of late elementary and middle school students across the country. Even during this project, approximately 1,950 students?including many from districts with diverse populations and low math proficiency?will benefit from learning with Decimal Point and Angle Jungle.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.

Because SNPs arrive earlier than SEPs, their detection provides several extra minutes of warning for taking action. The project team from the University of Hawaii, University of New Hampshire, and University of Arizona will set up a new space weather (SW) center in Hawaii and deploy a neutron monitor (NM) on the summit of the Haleakala volcano. They will analyze energetic particle data from the Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer (AMS) on the International Space Station and ground-based NMs. A report on these observations will be made available in real time to global and domestic users. The SW center will also provide extensive outreach programs advancing science, technology, engineering, and mathematics expertise, especially among young women and underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This work addresses the causes of ground-level events from SEP events, specifically in the context of propagation and event characteristics. The team will analyze SEP events detected by AMS, employ models for tracking particle propagation in various regions of the heliosphere and Earth's magnetosphere and atmosphere, and extend the coverage of the NM network to a station particularly suitable for detecting SNPs and galactic cosmic rays with rigidity cutoff above 13 GV. Comparing direct measurements in space by AMS with those on the ground by NMs will shed light on the atmospheric shower cascades that lead to secondary particle production and probe the validity of different models for nuclear interactions in the low energy range (hundreds of MeV to few GeV) involving iron and light elements up to oxygen. Real-time monitoring data, parameters related to the interplanetary and geomagnetic environment, and space weather alerts will be provided by the SW center.

The positive effects of routine physical contact between friends, family members, and relationship partners often are taken for granted, but the importance placed on physical contact was brought into focus when social distancing kept people physically apart. This project focuses attention on the unique benefits of everyday affectionate physical contact. A primary aim of this project is to test why physical contact is beneficial for individuals and their relationships. What are the psychological effects of affectionate physical contact that differentiate it from verbal expressions of affection? This research tests how physical and verbal affection influence the mental models people hold (beliefs about whether they are worthy of love and care and whether others are supportive and trustworthy) and their couple identity (whether they think in terms of ""we"" and ""us""). Further, this program of research assesses resulting behavioral changes that enhance individual and relationship functioning. A second aim of this project is to test how initial differences in people's mental models modulate the psychological effects of physical and verbal affection to determine who benefits (and perhaps who does not benefit) from affectionate physical contact. Understanding the unique psychological processes underlying physical versus verbal affection ? how and for whom effects occur ? will provide a foundation to help couples enhance their relationships and personal well-being.<br/><br/>This program of research uses a multi-method approach combining nonexperimental (ecological momentary assessments, observer-rated discussions) and experimental designs to identify the unique consequences of naturally occurring physical affection and a weeklong physical affection intervention. The mechanistic model guiding this research posits that a) physical affection uniquely encodes a state of security into existing mental models and uniquely fosters self-other overlap between partners, which b) enables people to enact behaviors that enhance their relationships and their personal well-being. This project incorporates cutting-edge measurement and analysis strategies to assess immediate and long-term consequences of physical affection. An ecological momentary assessment component captures daily levels of physical affection and self-other overlap. Moment-to-moment analyses of couple discussions reveal associations of physical affection (continuous observer ratings of duration and intensity) with secure mental models (time-linked continuous affect ratings of felt security). Additionally, the consequences of the physical affection intervention are being evaluated using sensitive and objective measures, including an implicit measure of attachment security that captures changes in mental models and observer ratings of constructive relationship behaviors that occur in guided couple interactions. Finally, this program of research examines who may or may not benefit from physical affection by analyzing the significant portion of people who believe and expect that others cannot be trusted (avoidantly-attached individuals). A significant component of this project is dedicated to providing opportunities for students to develop methodological and analytical expertise. Students receive direct training on designing, conducting, and analyzing multi-method studies that combine different measures, designs, and assessment timeframes. In addition, the project supports the development and dissemination of scaffolded resource toolkits that help undergraduate students produce independent research proposals. Ultimately, this project advances knowledge on fundamental aspects of how people think about and navigate their close relationships, and it can inform effective and scalable interventions to protect and enhance personal and relational well-being.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This purpose is served by novel techniques based upon machine learning and natural language processing for analyzing different types of documentations, such as those for payment, single-sign-on, and for the 3rd Generation Partnership Project or 3GPP. Examples of such techniques include sentiment analysis for finding the statements related to security requirements and a similarity and differential analysis that compares different statements about similar security-critical operations to capture inconsistency.  Furthermore, the project studies emerging techniques such as service syndication through comparing the documentations of different services and the 3GPP ecosystem from analyzing its public text data for risk measurement, identification and mitigation.

In this project, funded by the Mathematical and Physical Sciences Directorate and housed in the Chemistry Division, Professor Shabnam Hematian and her research team at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro will study catalytic processes to generate value-added chemicals from light, air, and simple compounds. As the demand for green chemistry and sustainable chemical design increases, the use of green energy sources such as light, rather than high energy chemical reagents, offers an energy-efficient means to transform cheap and unreactive raw materials into chemicals with higher molecular complexity and value. A photocatalyst must be used to capture the light and then act as an intermediary in the bond rearrangement reaction to form target products. Also, harnessing the oxidizing power of oxygen in the air (i.e., dioxygen) as a green terminal oxidant is of great interest. In this project, Professor Hematian and her team will attempt to develop new photocatalysts that can utilize dioxygen and absorb light to drive the air-oxidation of hydrocarbons, such as those found in petroleum products, to form alcohols, epoxides, and other valuable chemical products. The project will also provide research opportunities for local high school and community college students at earlier stages of their academic life as well as homeschooled high school students that typically have no access to these opportunities. A primary objective of the project to recruit students who are historically underrepresented in STEM, thus broadening participation and retention in the chemistry field.<br/><br/>The project will focus on development of oxo-bridged heterobinuclear systems, in which the two different metal centers, such as iron and copper, are attached through an oxo ligand, via dioxygen chemistry. This class of oxo-bridged assemblies will then be investigated for the photoactivation of their metal-oxo bonds and overall catalytic activities. This effort and the modularity of the oxo-bridged assemblies will provide deeper insights into the reaction pathways to guide the design of next-generation aerobic photocatalysts in the pursuit of developing green oxidation processes.

It will explore new approaches to facilitating data sharing between collaborating life scientists by diving deep into the issues surrounding the challenges associated with access control through ethnographic interviews and by developing new systems that simplify and expedite data sharing. Data sharing is considered one of the biggest challenges faced by life scientists, as different disciplines produce data with different characteristics, methods, and data sharing needs and criteria. Improvements to the data sharing process will aid life scientists in advancing biological and biomedical research, which could dramatically improve the health and well-being of individuals in society.<br/><br/>Four key insights regarding current access control systems guide this research: (1) Lack of default or transferable access settings leads to inefficiency. (2) Lack of visible sharing settings can result in accidental data sharing. (3) Inconsistent ownership over files can lead to inaccessible data once researchers leave the collaboration. (4) Data-sharing technologies that are institution agnostic are the most used. The research will clarify such challenges that are associated with access control when sharing data with collaborators, through semi-structured interviews and observation of life scientists when they are sharing data.

For example, successful treatment of multidimensional shock and roll waves would advance general theory, while providing a solid framework on roll wave behavior in shallow water flow/hydraulic engineering.  The research methods that will be used in the project include a blend of numerical, formal asymptotic, and dynamical systems/turning point tools with specialized techniques coming from detonation theory and hyperbolic conservation laws.  The validation of simple stability criteria for roll waves in shallow water flow and the introduction of new asymptotic and numerical methods are of wider application in both hydraulic engineering and the theory of hyperbolic shock and boundary value problems.

Noncommutative algebra historically arose in the algebraic study of symmetry, in linear algebra, and perhaps most profoundly in quantum mechanics. Since the advent of algebraic geometry, commutative algebra has been revolutionized by geometric ideas. In a similar way, the development of noncommutative geometry over the past several decades has stimulated many new ideas and perspectives in noncommutative algebra, but to date it has posed more challenges than it has solved. For instance, many noncommutative algebras are expected to be well-behaved due to the geometric nature of their construction, but we lack the algebraic tools to prove that this is the case. Furthermore, noncommutative geometry largely remains a collection of loosely related frameworks that are not directly compatible with one another, which can make the field especially difficult for newcomers. This project will directly address these fundamental problems by creating new techniques to deduce good algebraic properties for geometrically constructed noncommutative algebras and providing new tools to represent geometric structures corresponding to noncommutative algebras. The project will involve research and training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The first part of this project focuses on homological problems in noncommutative algebraic geometry. The PI and collaborators will use methods of Koszul duality and the representations of finite-dimensional algebras to attack a longstanding conjecture that Artin-Schelter (AS) regular algebras are domains. Related techniques will be used to understand when generalized AS regular algebras that are not necessarily connected, such as graded Calabi-Yau algebras, are prime rings. The second part of this project is focused on spectral problems in noncommutative geometry. The PI will use a variety of approaches to understand noncommutative discrete spaces and utilize them to construct noncommutative spectrum functors for both rings and C*-algebras. Topics to be investigated include structure sheaves for noncommutative spaces, methods to characterize dual coalgebras, discretization of C*-algebras, and a projective representation theory for rings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address this challenge, this project?s goal is to design a network of airborne drones and wireless sensors that can aid in initial wildfire localization and mapping, near-term prediction of fire progression, and providing communications support for firefighting personnel on the ground. Two key aspects differentiate the system from prior work: (1) It leverages and subsequently updates detailed three-dimensional models of the environment, including the effects of fuel type and moisture state, terrain, and atmospheric/wind conditions, in order to provide the most timely and accurate predictions of fire behavior possible, and (2) It adapts to hazardous and rapidly changing conditions, optimally balancing the need for wide-area coverage and maintaining communication links with personnel in remote locations. The science and engineering developed under this project can be adapted to many applications beyond wildfires including structural fires in urban and suburban settings, natural or man-made emergencies involving radiation or airborne chemical leaks, ""dirty bombs"" that release chemical or biological agents, or tracking highly localized atmospheric conditions surrounding imminent or on-going extreme weather events.<br/><br/>The system developed under this project will enable more rapid localization and situational awareness of wildfires at their earliest stages, better predictions of both local, near-term and event-scale behavior, better situational awareness and coordination of personnel and resources, and increased safety for fire fighters on the ground. Models ranging from simple algebraic relationships based on wind velocity to more complex time-dependent coupled fluid dynamics-fire physics models will be used to anticipate fire behavior. These models are hampered by stochastic processes such as the lofting of burning embers to ignite new fires, that cause errors to grow rapidly with time. This project is focused on closing the loop using sensor data provided by airborne drones and ground-based sensors (GBS). The models inform the sensing by anticipating rapid growth of problematic phenomena, and the subsequent sensing updates the models, providing local wind and spot fire locations. Closing this loop as quickly as possible is critical to mitigating the fire?s impact. The system we propose integrates advanced fire modeling tools with mobile drones, wireless GBS, and high-level human interaction for both the initial attack of a wildfire event and subsequent on-going support.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These subjects were developed initially in the early part of the 20th century as part of the development of the mathematical foundations of quantum mechanics. These ideas have subsequently evolved in many unexpected directions, far from their original source, with applications not only in physics (such as the currently very active areas of quantum computing and quantum information theory), but also in electrical and mechanical engineering (where these ideas are applied in the design of automatic control systems, in signal and image processing), and even artificial intelligence and machine learning. A particularly new and exciting branch of this field is known as ?noncommutative function theory? which has its origins in the study of certain kinds of optimization questions in engineering, but has grown to take on a life of its own.  The adjacent area of ?multivariable operator theory? is multi-faceted but is closely connected with many questions arising in these applications (such as the study of quantum channels, and the theory of ?linear matrix inequalities? in optimization). The project is aimed at expanding the array of mathematical tools available for the study of these questions, and at deepening our understanding of the interplay between these diverse mathematical ideas. The project further will integrate research and education, and professional development of junior researchers. A ?Math Circle? program at a local school is to be carried out.<br/><br/>The project will employ a blend of techniques from operator theory (especially in several variables), functional analysis, and complex analysis to study the interrelation between operator theory and the rapidly developing field of ""free analysis"" or ""noncommutative"" function theory. These recent, rapid developments have made new tools available to the study of some basic questions in mathematical analysis and have already found applications to diverse areas of mathematics, including optimization theory, convex analysis, and quantum information theory.  The goal of joint work with graduate students is to apply these new methods to questions at the intersection of functional analysis and complex function theory, particularly the study of function-theoretic operator theory in ""noncommutative"" domains, including questions about factorizations, zero sets, and realization theory for noncommutative rational functions.

A dynamical system here stands for an abstract set of points together with an evolution law that governs the way points move over time. Such abstract dynamical systems form the basis for models of a wide range of important phenomena in science and engineering. It turns out that many questions in mathematics concerning simultaneous approximation of real numbers by rational numbers can be understood in terms of the behavior of dynamical systems. Furthermore, systems that arise in this context are of algebraic nature, which makes it possible to use a wide variety of sophisticated tools for their investigation. This research project aims to advance the framework of algebraic dynamical systems in approximation theory, develop new methods, and obtain far-reaching generalizations of results in the field. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the project and introduced to new methods and techniques in number theory and dynamics. These students will also supervise research projects within the framework of the PRIMES program, an after-school research program for high school students.<br/><br/>During recent years there have been important developments concerning connections between Diophantine approximation and dynamical systems. This research project continues the study of phenomena in both dynamics and number theory related to asymptotic and uniform approximations.

While abstract set theory is replete with counterintuitive pathologies (such as splitting a ball into five pieces and reassembling them into two copies of the original ball), many of these are circumvented by imposing constraints on the definition of the sets involved.  Moreover, the search for definable solutions to some question is often tied closely with the study of algorithms in computer science.  In this fashion, algorithms for analyzing configurations in large finite networks often correspond to descriptive set-theoretically simple solutions to infinite problems, and there are notable examples of the infinite analysis shedding light on the finite counterparts as well.  Drawing out further connections between these finite and infinite settings is a major focus of the project, which is accessible to student researchers as well as more advanced mathematicians. The project includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>More specifically, the project applies descriptive set-theoretic methods to examine the structure of definable graphs.  Such graphs often arise in topological dynamics and ergodic theory, and in particular their combinatorial properties are often intertwined with algebraic aspects of the acting group. Specific combinatorial problems under investigation include: determining definable chromatic numbers of graphs, identifying when matchings and circulations can be found, and characterizing when such graph admit useful acyclic subgraphs. The project also explores applications of these ideas towards finding tilings of group actions and understanding the equidecomposability relation arising from such actions.  These topics are all closely tied with the local model of distributed computing in theoretical computer science and also have interactions with finite combinatorics, graph limits, probability, and geometric group theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Because SNPs arrive earlier than SEPs, their detection provides several extra minutes of warning for taking action.

In recent decades, important clinical advances in cancer treatments have been attributed to molecular subtyping and targeted treatments aiming at specific genes. However, a significant percentage of patients do not respond to targeted therapies or develop resistance over time. This implies that current methods for tumor characterization and therapeutic interventions are not sufficiently accurate. This project aims to develop novel technologies able to better differentiate among patients diagnosed with the same cancer type. Fundamental to this personalized analysis approach is the capability to explain why patients with similar cancer can greatly differ in terms of treatment success. The approach will also feature an effective integration methodology of multiple types of data. This work will enhance our ability to distinguish among patients who are in immediate danger and need the most aggressive treatments and those whose disease will progress slowly. This will lead to reduced health care costs and personal suffering while improving patient care by identifying the correct personalized treatment for each patient. This research will pave the way for future projects in identifying clinically applicable biomarkers that can be used in diagnosis, risk prediction, and monitoring treatment response and outcome. The project also has an extensive education and outreach component, including curriculum development, undergraduate research, museum exhibits for children, and outreach activities to community colleges and K-12 schools in Nevada.<br/><br/><br/>This project will address two important challenges commonly faced in cancer subtyping: (1) incorporation of pathway knowledge in cancer subtyping, patient stratification, and risk prediction, and (2) efficient integration of multi-cohort and multi-omics data. To address the first challenge, the project will develop novel machine learning technologies to identify impacted pathways and compute personalized pathway profiles in individual patients. The innovation of this idea stems from combining classical probabilistic components with important biological factors that are not captured in existing techniques: i) all gene-gene interactions as described by each pathway, ii) topology among multi-omics layers, and iii) the crosstalk among pathways. The approach will transform all molecular data to a common pathway space, making it possible to efficiently address the second challenge: systematically integrate multi-omics and multi-cohort data. This will be realized by a non-negative-kernel, variational autoencoders. The non-negative kernel will effectively accumulate consistent signals of biomarkers while shrinking random noise of non-relevant components. The goal of this project will be achieved by three thrusts: 1) compute personalized pathway profiles that can be used for subtyping, 2) integrate multiple patient cohorts to increase sample size and statistical power of subtyping methods, and 3) validate the proposed methodologies using 10 subtype discovery methods, 6 patient stratification techniques, and 6 risk prediction models that will be tested on more than 70 cancer datasets. The investigator will make the methodologies publicly available via a Bioconductor package and a web-based platform, thus increasing their potential for wide adoption by the research communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Group representation theory allows one to study groups via their actions on vector spaces which model the ways they arise in the real world. It has fascinated mathematicians for more than a century, and has had many important applications in quantum mechanics, the theory of elementary particles, coding theory, and cryptography, and is expected to continue to play an important role in the modern world of computers and digital communications. This research will contribute to advances in the understanding and applications of representation theory of finite groups. Student involvement will be a scientifically important component of the project.<br/><br/>This project focuses on several problems in the representation theory of finite groups and its applications. Many of these problems come up naturally in the group representation theory. Others are motivated by various applications.

The PI will also continue his long-term project to develop a theory of character level and to establish strong bounds on character values of finite groups of Lie type, and to classify modular representations of finite quasisimple groups of low dimension or with special properties. He will then apply the results to achieve significant progress on a number of applications, including local systems and their monodromy groups, Aschbacher's conjecture on subgroup lattices, random walks on Cayley and McKay graphs and representation varieties of Fuchsian groups, word map distributions and Thompson's conjecture for simple groups, Miyamoto's problem with applications to vertex operator algebras, and bounds on cohomology groups and presentations of finite quasisimple groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many fields, researchers seek to determine what hypotheses are supported by data collected in complex study designs.  Data may be complex because they are collected in many locations, at many points in time, from related sampling units, under different sampling conditions, with different sample sizes, and/or with imperfect measurements.  Such complexities arise in research fields such as biology, astronomy, education, environmental science, political science, and psychology, among others.  When analyzing complex data, it can be difficult for researchers to determine which potential patterns are real and which are spurious.  To solve this problem, researchers utilize computer algorithms to thoroughly explore all possible underlying relationships among variables that might explain the observed data.  Such algorithms can be slow, costly, and difficult to create, so it is important to make them faster and easier for researchers to use.  The investigators of this project have previously created a software package called NIMBLE (Numerical Inference for statistical Models using Bayesian and Likelihood Estimation) for this purpose.  NIMBLE has been successfully used for many complex data analysis problems.  Compared to other relevant software, NIMBLE enables researchers to use a wider range of algorithms and to customize algorithms to each research problem.  This has allowed much faster performance in some cases, which in turn allows more comprehensive analysis of complex data.  In the current project, the investigators will extend NIMBLE?s capabilities.  They will make it possible to use some kind of accurate mathematical approximations for statistical calculations in combination with existing algorithms, which in turn will allow researchers to create new kinds of hybrid algorithms for data analysis.  They will also make it possible to use certain kinds of very efficient calculations in some problems, which will greatly improve performance.

This will allow methods such as sparse grid quadrature to integrate over one set of model dimensions to achieve the calculations needed by another algorithm such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.  In turn, this capability will allow composition of methods such as Laplace approximation and methods that use it.  This project will also extend NIMBLE?s algorithm language to support sparse matrix algebra methods, allowing this efficient approach to be used by algorithm developers to enhance computational efficiency.  Together, the advances in this project will enhance statistical research by enabling NIMBLE to serve as a hub for composition of models and methods, whereby a data analyst can create one statistical model and use many different methods with it.

Topology can help us investigate difficult and interesting questions, such as what the shape of our universe is, how we can extract meaningful information from noisy data sets, or how human DNA, which unravels to be several feet long, can fold up to fit inside a cell.  The project investigates mathematical properties of knots, which are knotted up loops in three-dimensional space, and three-manifolds, which are objects that locally look like the three-dimensional world we live in. The central theme is to investigate how information about knots and three-manifolds is dictated by two-dimensional information, namely, maps on surfaces. Turning a three-dimensional question into a two-dimensional one is a powerful tool throughout topology and geometry. In this project, knots can be represented by objects called braids, and three-manifolds can be represented by objects called open book decompositions, both of which give ways of associating a map on a surface to a knot or three-manifold, respectively. One can ask how properties of these maps dictate properties of the corresponding knot or three-manifold. The investigator also plans to hold career preparation events, math circles in areas of broad interest such as public health, and a distinguished speaker series at her institution, with the goal of increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in STEM and enhancing the research environment at her institution. <br/><br/>The investigator will undertake three projects that investigate how properties of three-manifolds and knots are dictated by two-dimensional information.

They will also make it possible to use certain kinds of very efficient calculations in some problems, which will greatly improve performance.  The investigators will also provide support and training to users of the software as well as creating educational modules to help the next generation of undergraduate and graduate students learn to use these methods.<br/><br/>NIMBLE is unique among hierarchical statistical modeling software because it combines a language for statistical models, a language for model-generic algorithms, and a compiler to generate and use C++ source code for models and algorithms.  In the current project, NIMBLE will be extended to support hybrid methods by enabling algorithms to be nested within models.  This will allow methods such as sparse grid quadrature to integrate over one set of model dimensions to achieve the calculations needed by another algorithm such as Markov chain Monte Carlo.  In turn, this capability will allow composition of methods such as Laplace approximation and methods that use it.  This project will also extend NIMBLE?s algorithm language to support sparse matrix algebra methods, allowing this efficient approach to be used by algorithm developers to enhance computational efficiency.  Together, the advances in this project will enhance statistical research by enabling NIMBLE to serve as a hub for composition of models and methods, whereby a data analyst can create one statistical model and use many different methods with it.  Finally, this project will include training and support for new and existing users.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Developing new catalysts is critical to discovering new, efficient chemical reactions. Historically, homogeneous catalysts use just one metal atom at the core of the catalyst. In contrast, dinuclear catalysts have two metal atoms at the core of the catalyst and have significant promise for new designs and modes of operation. Dinuclear catalysts also hold promise for speeding up historically slow/difficult chemical reactions where current single metal catalysts do not perform well. Currently, research scientists do not fully understand how dinuclear catalysts facilitate rapid reactions, or which dinuclear catalysts should be the target of synthesis for specific chemical transformations. In this project Dr. Daniel Ess will be using computational methods and theoretical analysis to understand mechanisms and selectivity of reactions catalyzed by such dinuclear metal systems. This work, interfaced tightly with experimental collaboration, will lead to the prediction and experimental discovery of new dinuclear catalysts and chemical reactions. This work will also provide training for undergraduate and graduate students as well as postdoctoral scholars at the interface between chemistry and computer science.<br/><br/>Daniel Ess of Brigham Young University is using quantum-chemical methods and theoretical analyses to model and understand transition-metal heterodinuclear and homodinuclear catalysts for organic transformations. The dinuclear catalysts being investigated have direct bonding between two transition metals as the core of the catalyst.

Selectivity for hydrocarbon semi-hydrogenation, for cyclization reactions,  and for stereoselective addition reactions will be the foci of these investigations. This work will be combining quantum-chemical methods and machine learning techniques to design new heterodinuclear catalysts.

Photochemistry is intrinsically ?green chemistry? as it uses light (potentially solar light) as both source of energy and reactant. The proposed research program in photochemistry aims to establish a new paradigm for controlling and enhancing selectivity of photochemical reactions, and can potentially lead to new environmentally benign chemical processes. It will also lead to better understanding of the mechanisms of photochemical reactions,  thus helping to develop them as practically useful synthetic tools. Students participating in this program will benefit from multidisciplinary and collaborative training. The Nesterov group will also contribute to society through participation in special hands-on outreach activities to local K-12 schools.<br/><br/>The goal of this research is to establish and develop a novel paradigm relating to the tuning of photochemistry with plane-polarized light.  This has the potential to control the course and selectivity of photochemical reactions through the uniform molecular alignment of photoreactive compounds and through the use of spatially selective excitation of a particular electronic transition with plane-polarized light. In contrast to previous ways of controlling photochemical reactivity through imposing certain geometric constraints on the photoreactive molecule, the proposed approach will not rely on a topochemical ?reaction cavity.? Rather the approach taken here is to selectively excite a particular electronic transition leading to a desired photochemical transformation. If successful, these studies would also deliver a simple method to experimentally correlate the outcome of a photochemical reaction with specific electronic transitions, a potentially valuable tool for the study of photochemical reaction mechanisms. The project involves the following specific aims: (1) design and synthesis of a series of photochemically reactive compounds with enhanced ability to align in liquid crystalline media, allowing these systems to display excitation-selective photochemical reactivity;  (2) detailed investigation of the photochemistry of these systems using plane-polarized light; (3) investigation of the potential to carry out similar reactions on photochemical substrates without specially added aligning groups and (4) development of alternative methods for the uniform alignment of photoreactive molecules without using a liquid crystalline solvent.  This will include examining Langmuir films on air-water interfaces or using molecular ?alignment enhancers? and studying plane-polarized light controlled photochemistry in such systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These perceptions appear to influence female students? interest and performance in math, as well as their pursuit of STEM careers. Given the potential motivational benefits of digital learning games, games might provide a pathway for reducing math anxiety for female students while increasing their self-efficacy and interest in math. This project will explore whether digital learning games can lead to less math anxiety and better learning in female students, while not hurting male student learning. It will study learning with two existing digital learning games: Decimal Point, which teaches foundational math concepts (decimal numbers and operations) to 5th and 6th grade students; and Angle Jungle, which targets a similar age range (4th and 5th graders) and has a similar thematic design (i.e., a game map, cartoon characters), but with different game mechanics, content (angles), and instructional approach. The study will explore how and why Decimal Point has, over the course of several experiments spanning multiple years, consistently produced a learning advantage for female students. In doing so, investigators will identify principles regarding the relationship between gender and game features that can be shared with game developers and used in other games, starting with Angle Jungle.<br/><br/>This work will go beyond the traditional gender binary of male and female, analyzing multiple dimensions of gender, including gender identity (e.g., how much students feel like a boy, a girl, both, neither), gender typicality (e.g., How much students like to do the same things as other girls [boys], How much students feel they look like boys [girls]), and gender-typed interests, activities, and traits (e.g., how much a student feels affectionate or adventurous). The study will also investigate two pathways hypothesized to lead to gender differences: first, that the playful features of the games reduce the saliency of the math content, making it less likely to cue math stereotype threat (the stereotype threat hypothesis); and second, that the games? thematic details are more appealing to learners who identify (more) as females, making the games more engaging for them compared to learners who identify (more) as boys (the engagement hypothesis). In Year 1, educational data mining will be used to infer students? cognitive and affective processes while playing Decimal Point and compare data to the distinct processes predicted by these two pathways. In Year 2, investigators will assess whether the hypothesized pathways and gender differences replicate in the context of Angle Jungle. In Year 3, hypotheses will be further tested by manipulating Decimal Point?s emphasis on math content in one version of the game and enjoyment and playful features in another. The project will compare learning outcomes between the two versions to more deeply explore the stereotype threat and engagement hypotheses. The ultimate aim of this work is to provide insights into gender-based differences in learning from digital games, providing principles and guidance for other researchers and game designers in developing and revising digital learning games. Thus, the project has the potential to transfer Decimal Point?s success with girls? learning outcomes to other digital learning games and advance knowledge on the multidimensionality of gender. Furthermore, findings will allow investigators to revise both games and make them available to thousands of late elementary and middle school students across the country. Even during this project, approximately 1,950 students?including many from districts with diverse populations and low math proficiency?will benefit from learning with Decimal Point and Angle Jungle.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field.

These ice age cycles occur on roughly 100,000 year timescales and are marked by 100 meter-scale changes in global sea level in response to the growth and retreat of large continental ice sheets. The timing, duration, and magnitude of ice age sea-level fluctuations is largely controlled by changes in Earth?s surface temperature due to variations in the Earth?s orbit around the sun and the amount of planet-warming greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. Our understanding of the complex interactions between Earth?s orbit and greenhouse gases that drive sea-level change remains incomplete. Coastal cave deposits called speleothems provide rare, but valuable constraints on past sea-level change. Speleothems provide an upper limit on the position of the ocean surface, as they form from cavern dripwaters and cannot grow when submerged below sea level and can be precisely dated using U-Th dating or geochronology. For this project, the researcher will produce a novel, speleothem-based sea level record extending back ~400,000 years, covering the last four glacial cycles. This project will improve our understanding of the fundamental physical processes that drive sea-level change during ice age cycles and, by extension, the sea-level rise in a warming world. This is a timely topic, as ?what are the rates, mechanisms, impacts and geographic variability of sea level change?? has been highlighted as one of the eight priority science questions by the National Academy of Sciences? 2015-2025 Decadal Survey of Ocean Sciences.<br/><br/>The project will leverage an extraordinary collection of speleothems recovered from presently-submerged Bahamian coastal caves (blue holes) during the late 1980s/early 1990s at depths ranging from 4 to 77 m below present sea level. Such records are exceedingly rare, requiring many years of expensive and risky fieldwork and coordination with experience cave divers. In pursuing the project, the PI will have access to (1) the entire Bahamas collection (~117 speleothems), many of which remain undated, (2) state-of-the-art U-series analytical facilities and (3) cutting-edge microanalytical facilities available at University of Minnesota ? Twin Cities (e.g., micro computed tomography [?CT], electron probe microanalysis [EPMA]) to assess the physical, chemical and petrologic characteristics of growth hiatus boundaries, which is crucial for determining the precise timing of cave inundation due to sea-level rise. Finally, the results will be evaluated using GIA modelling to place the data in the broader context of global mean sea level. Taken together, this approach will greatly enhance the quality of sea-level information that can be extracted from speleothem-based archives, providing critical constraints on the timing and duration of late Pleistocene sea level change.<br/>Results will be useful to the broader Ocean Sciences community to produce robust sea-level projections to help policymakers, stakeholders and the general public in coastal communities adapt to future sea-level rise. Potential avenues for disseminating project results to the general public include outreach efforts such as the Skype a Scientist program, where the PI has an active record of participation. The PI will also partner with NOAA?s Science on a Sphere program to develop data visualizations that effectively convey key concepts of late Pleistocene sea-level change to a non-specialist audience. The PI is also committed to broadening participation in the Ocean Sciences and will partner with the hosting institution to foster an inclusive work environment and also encourage increased STEM participation from historically underrepresented groups through ongoing K-12 outreach initiatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In considering the global challenges society faces today, the issue of securing future energy resources is particularly conspicuous. As fossil fuels are depleted, chemists have turned their focus to investigating synthetic methods for the conversion of abundant greenhouse gases into energy-rich chemical fuels. A central challenge to developing sustainable and renewable fuel production strategies is the activation of these small molecules. Industrially, solid-state metal oxide catalysts have been shown effective for the mediation of small molecule activation reactions (e.g., the reduction of CO2 to methanol). Reactive metal ions, accessed through the loss of an oxygen atom from the surface of the material, have been proposed to participate in small molecule activation reactions.  To elucidate properties of multimetallic systems that inform the surface reactivity of these materials, the Matson Laboratory will study how the elemental composition of vanadium oxide clusters translates to the propensity of oxygen-atoms to be removed from the assembly. These studies will aid in the elucidation of design criteria of superior catalysts for the production of chemical fuels. Dr.  Matson will continue to provide leadership in a campus-wide effort to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) departments, and in organizing the Western New York Symposium in inorganic chemistry.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop and study the synthesis and reactivity of oxygen-atom vacancies at the surface of vanadium oxide clusters. Oxygen-atom vacancies at the surface of heterogeneous, reducible metal oxides play a critical role in the conversion of inert, energy-poor substrates to energy-rich chemical fuels. Understanding the mechanism(s) by which these defect sites form, and the structure-function relationships that define the generation and reactivity of O-atom vacancies, will provide a template for the strategic design of materials with enhanced activity. During the funding period, Matson will study new schemes for the formation of oxygen-atom defects at the surface of polyoxovanadate-alkoxide clusters. Subsequently, Matson will investigate the role cation- and anion-dopants, as well as surface ligands, play in modulating the formation of oxygen-atom vacancies at the surface of the assembly. Characterization of all complexes will be performed via 1H NMR, infrared, and electronic absorption spectroscopy, as well as electrospray ionization mass spectrometry and single crystal X-ray diffraction. Additional kinetic analysis will provide insight into mechanisms and activation parameters associated with oxygen-atom vacancy formation at the surface of the cluster.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In these magnetic memory devices, the information is encoded in the magnetization direction of a bistable ferromagnetic thin film layer. To achieve thermally stable and closely packed magnetic bits, a perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic layer is preferred. Spin orbit torques, generated by applying a charge current to an adjacent spin source material, has emerged as an efficient means to manipulate or switch the perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic layer. However, an external magnetic field is required to achieve deterministic spin orbit torque switching of a perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnetic layer because the charge-current induced spin current in conventional spin-source materials is polarized in the film plane due to the crystal symmetry. This fundamental limitation in conventional spin-source materials has prevented the use of spin orbit torque to achieve field-free deterministic switching of ferromagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy. To overcome this longstanding hurdle in the field of spintronics, this research program proposes to explore low-symmetry crystal structure and topological electronic structure in a special class of materials, namely Weyl semimetals, to demonstrate field-free deterministic magnetization switching of variety of perpendicularly magnetized ferromagnets. A successful outcome of this research program will lead to next generation energy efficient magnetic memory and spin-logic devices. This research program will support the education and training of a graduate student and undergraduate students. Through proposed research activities, the graduate student and undergraduate students will be trained in experimental techniques and skill sets for spin orbit torques for nonvolatile magnetic memory devices. Educational outreach activities and events will be planned to kindle scientific interest and provide interactions and mentorship for middle school and high school students, especially those in southwestern Pennsylvania. Moreover, hands-on experimental demos to explain spin and magnetism-related phenomena will be developed for outreach activities.<br/><br/>Utilization of topology and crystal-symmetry in emergent quantum materials, to obtain large current induced spin orbit torques for an energy efficient and field-free manipulation of the magnetization in FM materials, is promising for spintronic device applications. In this context, Weyl semimetals provide a distinct opportunity to obtain highly efficient and unconventional charge to spin conversion owing to strong spin-orbit coupling, symmetry breaking, and topology-based phenomena. The goal of this research program is to demonstrate field-free operation of spin orbit torque-based prototype magnetic memory devices that exploit the interplay of low-symmetry crystal structure and topological electronic structure in Weyl semimetal candidate materials to generate spin current with out-of-plane spin polarization. The main research objectives of this program are to use electric field induced out-of-plane oriented spin current in Weyl semimetals to demonstrate field-free magnetization manipulation in three different classes of ferromagnets with perpendicular magnetic anisotropy, namely: (1) van der Waals based semi-metallic ferromagnets; (2) van der Waals based semiconducting ferromagnets; and (3) a ferromagnetic insulator. In proposed devices, integrated electrostatic gates will be used to tune the charge carrier density in Weyl semimetal thin films, to control magnetism in semiconducting ferromagnets for enhanced spin orbit torque-based device functionalities, and to probe electric-field dependent switching phase diagram to map out the optimal parameter space for low-energy spin orbit torque switching for magnetic memory applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This memory system is very limited. For example, we struggle to retain accurate information about just a few objects even over short timescales. The current proposal uses novel computational modeling and experimental techniques to better understand what information is stored about items in visual working memory. Importantly, the amount of information a person is able to hold in mind (i.e., in working memory) has been shown to be related to many other cognitive abilities (including intelligence), and disruptions of working memory are common in clinical disorders like attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and schizophrenia. New knowledge regarding how this information is stored and used is therefore critical for understanding the nature of important differences between individuals. Improving our understanding of the visual working memory system may also improve how we understand the execution of visual skills such as those involved in driving and other complex tasks which require simultaneous remembering and monitoring of multiple locations and objects (e.g., tracking the positions of cars in other lanes to decide whether it is safe to merge). This work may also inform the design of displays and user-interfaces by providing deeper knowledge of which visual elements are easiest (or hardest) for users to remember or navigate between. Beyond the primary research, this proposal also includes a significant outreach component, featuring both the recruitment and training of first-generation college students from underrepresented groups, as well as the development of software to allow scientists to better measure memory performance and to do so via methods that allow for recruitment of a wider, more representative sample of individuals (i.e., via internet-based experiments).<br/><br/>This research project seeks to understand what information our working memory system holds in mind about an object.  Existing theories of visual working memory commonly assume that a memory for a feature is represented by just a single value (e.g., for color memory, ?I think the couch was ?red??). By contrast, this proposal uses computational models of continuous reproduction tasks, whereby participants must reproduce the exact color or shape of a set of items in order to test for signatures of continuous strength population-codes.  The alternative conception of memory advanced by this project assumes that memory is not represented by a single value, but by an activation value for each possible value of a feature (e.g., memory for the color of the couch is not just ?red? but a range of values for each color).  The research in this proposal tests whether people have access to a probability distribution over features, rather than simply what single feature best reflects their memory. It also tests whether the variability between items (in precision and confidence) is predictable from such representations. The new theoretical framework advanced here ? which is rooted in signal detection theory ? not only allows for an understanding of objective measures like memory error, but also makes predictions about memory strength and the subjective feeling of confidence associated with memory strength. The framework also shares close parallels with neural population coding models of working memory. Thus, this work makes novel connections between working memory capacity, memory precision and confidence, and provides a bridge between neural and cognitive models of working memory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the primary focus is on theoretical properties of such matrices, the questions are motivated by applications in other sciences: economics, statistics, and physics. In data sciences, rectangular arrays appear whenever the observations are naturally arranged in two dimensions, for instance, in time and space. In quantum mechanics, matrices and related operators appear in modelling of a physical system. When the amount of available information about such a system is limited, a proper modelling is by taking the matrix to be random. This project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Random matrices and their eigenvalues play a central role in many research areas, including high-energy physics, growth models, number theory, and high-dimensional statistics. The project revolves around exactly solvable or integrable families of random matrices, for which the eigenvalues are accessible through explicit formulas, actions of differential operations, orthogonal polynomials, and other essentially algebraic techniques. The goal of this project is three-fold: to search for these families, develop delicate asymptotic results about them (which usually go far beyond theorems available for generic systems), and use them for obtaining asymptotic predictions for much wider classes of random matrices and related objects of applied interest. The central objects gluing together different parts of the project are beta-ensembles, which are N-dimensional distributions uniting and generalizing the laws of eigenvalues of various random matrices. While in classical contexts the parameter beta takes values 1, 2, or 4, depending on whether the matrices under consideration are real, complex, or are quaternion matrices, this project emphasize a point of view  in which beta is allowed to take arbitrary positive real values and should be interpreted as the inverse temperature in the terminology of statistical mechanics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mass timber, a broad term for a variety of engineered wood building materials, is an emerging construction technology in the US with up to 2,500 mass timber buildings expected to exist in the US by 2023, supported by an expected architecture, engineering, and construction (AEC) workforce of over 90,000 technicians by 2029. Much of the interest in increasing use of mass timber stems from the materials? enhanced sustainability performance via carbon storage and avoided emissions from conventional building materials, as well as from potential construction time and cost savings associated with substituting mass timber for other common building materials. But several industry, government, and academic sources have suggested that greater adoption of mass timber in the United States is limited by a lack of focus on workforce education. This project will create new opportunities for technician-level students in postsecondary AEC educational programs acquire knowledge and skills in mass timber design and construction. This content will be developed as a series of modules that can be readily integrated into academic programs, facilitating uptake by a national audience.<br/><br/>The project will prepare students to move into technician-level design and construction careers that include the pursuit and execution of mass timber projects. The specific components and activities to be developed through this project will be determined through interaction and collaboration with AEC industry. Previous data collection efforts have indicated that modular curriculum frameworks and virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) environments are in high demand among AEC faculty members for both students and faculty lacking access to nearby mass timber buildings. This project will benefit the AEC industry and broader society by providing a trained workforce for mass timber design and construction in the United States. Efforts to maximize uptake of curricular products by faculty include the creation of a faculty community of practice and inclusion into the project leadership team diverse representatives from a variety of institution types (2-year schools, 4-year schools, and minority serving institutions) from across the country into the project leadership team. By partnering with schools that have strong high school outreach programs and diverse student bodies, the team expects to serve a greater cross section of students and faculty than are traditionally part of AEC programs.

There are many interesting (conjecturally) irrational numbers in the literature with approximations by rational numbers that are not good enough to apply the classical methods. The principal investigator and collaborators will develop a new framework to explore the properties of certain power series constructed from these approximations in order to prove the conjectured irrationality in some important cases. The second part of the project studies the arithmetic of abelian varieties, which are higher dimensional analogues of elliptic curves. These geometric objects can be defined by polynomial equations over the integers. The principal investigator and collaborators will study the behavior of certain abelian varieties modulo different prime numbers. The proposed work includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students. <br/> <br/>For the first part, the classical way of proving irrationality can be formulated as studying the convergence radii of the power series associated to the rational approximations and comparing them to the denominator type of the power series. In earlier studies of rationality and algebraicity criterion of power series, the convergence radii have been replaced by many variants, which are numerically larger; therefore, there are rational approximations whose convergence radii are too small compared to the denominator type while these variants are large enough. The PI and collaborators expect to explore these larger radii variants to solve some irrationality questions.

Relationships between different dimensions arise in two ways. One way to study complicated 3- or 4-dimensional spaces is to decompose them into simpler pieces; the decomposition happens along lower-dimensional spaces, like surfaces. These are complicated versions of the principle that you cut a 3-dimensional watermelon by using a flat, 2-dimensional knife. Trying to do this leads one to ask in which ways low-dimensional spaces can sit inside high-dimensional ones. For example, 1-dimensional shoelaces can be knotted or unknotted; it was recently discovered that a 3-dimensional watermelon sitting in 4-space can also be knotted. This involves developing aspects of differential equations and abstract algebra. One long-term goal of the research project is to have a computer program that can compute certain subtle invariants of 4-dimensional spaces coming from counting solutions to differential equations from theoretical physics, the Seiberg-Witten equations. The grant will also support training graduate students in these topics, writing a book introducing some of them to graduate students and advanced undergraduates, outreach activities to share the excitement of geometry and topology with K-12 students, and a website to help other researchers use non-photorealistic raytracing to draw useful figures in their own papers.<br/><br/><br/>The research involves  a number of specific  projects.

The Standard Model of elementary particles and cosmology describes remarkably well the evolution of the Universe starting from one-trillionth of a second after the Big Bang up to the present day. Despite this huge success, several fundamental questions remain unanswered: What is dark matter? Why is there more matter than antimatter in the Universe? Why are neutrinos massive? Solving these mysteries requires an understanding of what happened before one-trillionth of a second after the Big Bang. The tool enabling us to dive this far back into the Universe's history has only recently been provided by the first successful detection of gravitational waves.

The mirror symmetry phenomenon asserts that Calabi--Yau manifolds come in mirror pairs X and Y which determine the same physics, implying surprising relations between geometric properties of X and Y. Birational geometry is the study of surgeries of spaces obtained by cutting out a subspace of lower dimension and gluing another in its place. The moduli space of a space Y parametrizes all possible spaces obtained by deforming Y. If X and Y are a mirror pair, then the birational geometry of X determines the structure of the moduli space of Y near a certain limit point. Based on this heuristic, Morrison conjectured that a Calabi--Yau manifold X admits only finitely many possible surgeries up to symmetries of X. The PI aims to show the conjecture is false in general, but a weaker statement sufficient for applications to moduli holds, as suggested by recent work of the PI with graduate students on unbounded Calabi--Yau manifolds. The PI will also study positively curved spaces called Fano manifolds and singularities that arise at limit points of the moduli space of Calabi--Yau manifolds via mirror symmetry. These projects will be pursued together with graduate students supported by the grant. The PI will also organize seminars and a conference focused on training of graduate students.<br/><br/>The PI will study Morrison's cone conjecture and applications to birational geometry and moduli, joint with a collaborator. Morrison conjectured that the automorphism group of a Calabi--Yau manifold acts on its nef cone with rational polyhedral fundamental domain, so that a neighborhood of a cusp of the moduli space of the mirror manifold admits a compactification determined by this data via a construction of Looijenga. Recent work of the PI with graduate students on log Calabi--Yau manifolds and mirror deformations of singularities suggests that the conjecture does not hold in general, but a weaker version sufficient for applications to moduli should hold. The PI will study mirror symmetry for Q-Fano 3-folds and applications to classification and non-arithmetic curves on moduli of K3 surfaces, joint with a graduate student. Q-Fano 3-folds arise as end products of the minimal model program and so are basic to our understanding of 3-folds. Mirror symmetry heuristics suggest that the mirror of a Q-Fano 3-fold is a K3 fibration over the affine line with monodromy at infinity that is maximally unipotent after a finite base change. The mirror corresponds to a rigid rational curve on a moduli space of polarized K3 surfaces.  Computations suggest that these curves are not Shimura curves but are uniformized by non-arithmetic groups. The PI will study mirror symmetry for Milnor fibers of surface singularities and applications to symplectomorphism groups and moduli of surfaces, a project that joint with others.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum communication technologies are advancing at a continually increasing pace and are now set to transform the technologies we use in our daily lives. A key building block for this advancement is the single-photon emitter (SPE). Solid-state SPEs based on point defects, especially those with energies that match telecommunication requirements (i.e., near infrared (NIR): 1320-1550 nm), could dramatically change how we connect to one another in the future.

Quantum communication technologies are advancing at a continually increasing pace and are now set to transform the technologies we use in our daily lives. A key building block for this advancement is the single-photon emitter (SPE). Solid-state SPEs based on point defects, especially those with energies that match telecommunication requirements (i.e., near infrared (NIR): 1320-1550 nm), could dramatically change how we connect to one another in the future. The utilization of lanthanide (Ln) (rare-earth) elements as SPEs could enable a quantum optical platform that matches the requirements for direct insertion into traditional optical communication infrastructure.

Newton transformed our understanding of gravity because he was able to solve the two-body problem (a completely integrable system) and so verify that his inverse-square law of gravity matched empirical observations. That the three-body problem is not solvable in the same sense does not undermine this; indeed, it is precisely what makes the basic two-body paradigm so essential to our understanding! Likewise, the shell model of the atom is born of a completely integrable approximation. The integrable systems at the center of this project are significantly more complicated, but likewise serve as oracles for the full-complexity systems at the forefront of science and engineering. Indeed, all the concrete models studied as part of this project arose initially as effective models of real physical systems (such as water waves, optics, and magnetohydrodynamics), stripped down to reveal the central mechanisms behind the observed phenomena. To fulfill the role just articulated, we must study these integrable systems in large-data non-perturbative regimes - regimes where still simpler models cannot reproduce the observed phenomenology. This is a hallmark of this research project and indeed, of the methods developed in the PI's recent work, more broadly. The project provides significant research training opportunities for graduate students and postdoctoral scholars, who are integrated into every major activity of the project.<br/><br/>The primary goal of the project is to advance the low-regularity theory of certain completely integrable dispersive partial differential equations, both as an end onto itself and as a tool for understanding the statistical mechanics of these systems. As a means to this end, the project further develops the commuting flows paradigm and seeks out new and diverse applications for several technical tools developed in support of this approach. Well-posedness problems will be studied, including that of the derivative nonlinear Schrodinger equation. Microscopic conservation laws will be deployed to further elaborate the spacetime structural properties of solutions constructed via commuting flows. The synthesis of renormalization and commuting flows technologies will be investigated, with a view to well-posedness, to the construction of Gibbs states, and to the dynamical properties thereof. Likewise, the continuum limit of discrete integrable models will be investigated both for deterministic initial data and as a means of gaining insight into Gibbs-state dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast with hyperbolic dynamical systems, which display exponential divergence of orbits, parabolic systems are much less understood.  Hyperbolic systems will also be studied insofar they appear as auxiliary tools in the study of parabolic ones, which are the main focus. The research will emphasize quantitative aspects that are relevant for applications. The project aims to advance our fundamental knowledge of dynamical systems and to develop new ideas and new methods of mathematical investigation with potential applications to geometry and number theory and thus indirectly to other scientific subjects. Also, since parabolic behavior appears in Hamiltonian mechanics, the project can directly advance our understanding of simple mathematical models of classical physical systems (billiards in polygons, statistical mechanics, planetary motions).  Research training and mentoring of students and postdocs is an important goal of the project, with particular attention to members of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>The investigator will carry out research in several directions (effective weak mixing of translation flows, Ruelle asymptotics, dynamics on character varieties) and  will continue work on longstanding open questions such as on effective ergodicity for non-horospherical unipotent flows (effective Ratner theory), optimal bounds on Weyl sums for higher degree polynomials, the ergodic theory of geodesic flows on flat surfaces and of billiards in non-rational polygons, as well as the ergodic and spectral theory of smooth parabolic flows. An important approach to parabolic systems, often called renormalization approach, replaces the direct studies of the parabolic dynamics with that of an auxiliary hyperbolic system, which is easier to understand by methods of hyperbolic theory (invariant manifolds, Lyapunov exponents).  Motivated by recent interest in the relation between parabolic and hyperbolic dynamics via renormalization, the investigator has broadened his research with work on exponential decay of correlations and Ruelle asymptotics for hyperbolic systems from the point of view of the effective (polynomial) equidistribution of unstable foliations, and will further pursue research on the interplay between effective equidistribution in parabolic dynamics and effective mixing in hyperbolic dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Virtual environments such as training simulations invite the user to play the role of one character in a narrative, while the system controls all the other non-player characters and the environment. Interactive narratives are effective tools for teaching people how to perform a task and educating people about important topics, but writing interactive narratives is challenging. Most are manually written, ensuring a nice structure but limiting their scope because every choice must be imagined in advance. Some environments are realistic simulations that give users freedom to do a wide variety of actions, but then it is hard for the designer to guarantee the narratives have the necessary content. This project will use artificial intelligence planning algorithms to create narratives at run time in games and training simulations. Planned narratives can have the structure of a hand-written story and the freedom of a simulation. This project will explore fast algorithms for generating narratives as well as models of what users remember and expect. Over the project duration, the research team will develop virtual environments (such as a virtual reality de-escalation training simulation for police officers) that evolves from a role-playing exercise between two people to a fully automated virtual environment where the artificial intelligence personalizes the interactive narrative for each player.<br/><br/>This project frames interactive narratives as an improvisational exercise between a player who controls one character and an experience manager who controls all the other elements of a virtual environment. These partners communicate their beliefs, intentions, memories, and expectations via the actions they choose to take, which is a noisy channel that requires inference for understanding. This project operationalizes the interactive narrative creation as a Mutual Implicit Question Answering (MIQA) process. Each action taken by one participant causes their partner to implicitly ask questions about why they took that action and/or implicitly answers questions that were raised earlier. The better one partner can answer questions raised by the other, the closer they are to mutual understanding. MIQA combines research on multi-agent artificial intelligence planning, cognitive models of memory and expectations, and procedures from automated question answering to represent both partners and how well they understand one another. Participants in an interactive virtual environment will do paired exercises where one will act as player and the other as experience manager. During this exercise, both partners will answer questions about their actions and about their perceptions of their partner?s actions. They will also report on their perceptions of the structure of the narrative and the player agency. These exercises will begin as person-to-person exercises but will evolve into person-to-intelligent-agent exercises through data gathering and model refinement. The research hypothesis is that the intelligent agent will be able to provide high-agency, structured interactive narratives that approach the quality of those created with a human partner. This hypothesis will be evaluated using a Turing test: can the player identify whether the interactive narration is controlled by a human or an intelligent agent. These exercises will take place in a virtual environment called Camelot, but the research team will simultaneously implement the same procedures into an ongoing virtual reality training simulation that is being built in consultation with police officer training experts to teach best practices for de-escalating potentially dangerous situations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These cations are the key intermediates in many important chemical and biological reactions, such as the oxidation of phenols and alkanes, the generation of industrial thermoplastics (plastics that do not soften on heating), and the oxidative halophenol dehalogenation by dehaloperoxidase in biology. Oxenium cations have also been implicated in astrochemical studies and are thought to persist in interstellar space. Despite their importance, knowledge on their reactivity is severely limited due to difficulties in generating and studying them in solution. Therefore, although aryloxenium ions have been investigated for more than 40 years, surprisingly  little is known about their fundamental chemical reactivity. The information obtained in this research will not only facilitate the rational utilization of aryloxenium cations in organic synthesis and industrial applications but will also enable the design of aryloxenium cations with tailored properties for specific applications. Educational activities in this project will include enhancing the scientific growth of graduate and undergraduate students, including  students belonging to underrepresented groups, via a diverse research experience. Hence, this research helps to diversify the STEM workforce. Graduate students involved in this project will participate in industrial or government internships, which not only leads to intellectual broadening but often also to enhanced employment opportunities. These interactions are expected to lead to  partnerships with industry and government laboratories,  facilitating technology transfer to these laboratories.<br/><br/>Detailed kinetic gas-phase reactivity studies on aryloxenium cations will be performed in order to improve the understanding of their chemical properties.

This project will utilize gas-phase ion-molecule reactions performed in ion trap mass spectrometers to explore their chemical properties. Action spectroscopy will be used to verify their structures. Aryloxenium ion reaction products with a variety of different reagents and not just solvents (not possible previously) will be identified. Rates of the reactions of aryloxenium cations will provide detailed kinetic reactivity information that is currently unavailable. The study of the influence of structural changes on the reactivity of aryloxenium cations and the examination of the reactivities of aryloxenium ions with different electronic ground states will facilitate the development of novel reactivity paradigms for aryloxenium cations.

The mathematical theory of singular integrals has traditionally been formulated in smooth geometric settings. However, demand for an understanding of singular integrals in rougher settings has grown recently with a more refined understanding of mathematical models for physical phenomena in irregular or non-smooth environments. Emerging applications of singular integrals in quantum computing further buttress the need for such extensions of the classical theory. Notably, the relationship between singular integrals and the geometry of sets and measures facilitates a new understanding of dimension reduction for high-dimensional point sets, that is, mechanisms to detect whether large collections of points in a high-dimensional space in fact lie on a smooth lower-dimensional manifold. Results of this nature are important for data science applications, and the project has the potential to bring the toolkit of singular integral theory to bear on this important application domain. By coupling pure harmonic analysis methods with tools from combinatorics and probability, and through its noticeable interface with questions of relevance in data science, the project will also provide opportunities for the training of junior mathematicians, including graduate students.<br/><br/>This project considers a variety of questions in the study of singular integrals in non-smooth or rough settings, using both existing and newly developed tools. The principal investigators have been at the forefront of the past development of such a theory, and the current project will crystallize new applications to other areas of geometry and analysis. Questions under consideration in this project include: (a) a sharp characterization of bounded singular integrals with matrix weight, which is important in the regularity theory of vector stationary stochastic processes, (b) a characterization of weighted boundedness for para-product singular operators on graphs with cycles (multi-trees, Hamming cubes, etc.), and (c) the David-Semmes regularity problem in codimensions larger than one.

Databases manage a significant portion of data for these applications. However, due to the lack of support for deep neural network inference in existing databases, artificial intelligence is usually provided by a separate process for machine learning. As a result, data transfer between decoupled systems significantly increases the latency, making it challenging to meet the time constraints of interactive applications. Such decoupling also complicates application development and system management. This research will enable native deep neural network model inferences from databases to eliminate cross-system overheads. It will provide a unified representation to bridge the gap between data queries and deep neural network models. Ultimately, the project will deliver a novel database system to facilitate interactive intelligent applications. The research will support a Big Data Magic Week activity for K-12 underrepresented students and refugee youths in Arizona. It will be used as a platform to prepare selected undergraduate students in Arizona State University for international research competitions.

The investigator divides the aim into three synergistic research thrusts. First, the research will develop methods to bridge the machine learning inference and the relational algebra processing through a unified two-level intermediate representation. It will support the progressive lowering of all-scale machine learning models into relational algebra expressions and flexible yet analyzable functions. Moreover, it facilitates multi-objective co-optimization of data queries and model inferences for optimal latency, accuracy, and resource utilization trade-offs. Second, the project will further provide ahead-of-time code generation to reduce the latency of model inferences. The generated code will allow runtime physical optimizations such as materialization of intermediate data and batch size tuning, which are adaptive to dynamic query frequencies. Third, the research will provide accuracy-aware storage optimizations by indexing and clustering tensor blocks based on their magnitudes, similarity, and other model-specific properties.

This important finding opens the door for such materials to be employed for the first time in the synthesis of a broad range of valuable compounds. For example, a goal of the funded project is to use the newly available class of N,O-acetals for the preparation of biologically active nitrogen-containing cyclic compounds commonly found as components in active pharmaceuticals. Furthermore, the research team will investigate a variety of processes involving the new reagents to uncover efficient methods for chemical manufacture that are straightforward and devoid of expensive additives, such as precious metal catalysts. The broader impacts of the project will extend to supporting research-based academic courses and summer research experiences for undergraduate students in synthetic organic chemistry at Hamilton College, with an emphasis on recruiting, training, and retaining students from underrepresented groups for careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM).<br/><br/>N-Quaternized ketene N,O-acetals have been overlooked as reagents in organic synthesis due to their typical instability and/or specialized means of generation in situ. However, it was recently discovered that certain compounds within this class, and particularly pyridinium ketene N,O-acetals, have long-term bench-stability that allows for their preparation and purification in a straightforward manner. This opens up the possibility of leveraging N-quaternized ketene N,O-acetals as versatile reagents in organic synthesis. For example, such compounds can act as a source of thermally-generated O-alkyl ketenium ions, which can be used in acid catalyst-free Friedel-Crafts acylations, or in various cycloaddition reactions. Beyond the continued explorations of these kinds of processes, Dr. Majireck and his team of undergraduate students will also study the use of 2-halo-N-(1-alkoxyvinyl)pyridinium salts as electrophiles for the production of 2-aminopyridine derivatives via mild nucleophilic aromatic substitution reactions.

Four-dimensional spaces are considerably more difficult to imagine (and study) with the most salient example being the spacetime conceptualization of the universe. In this sense, four-dimensional topology is the study of the possible shapes that our physical universe might realize. Surfaces have been well-studied classically, and major advances in the late 1900s and early 2000s have given researchers a clear understanding of three-dimensional manifolds. Four-dimensional manifolds represent the unknown frontier of low-dimensional topology, and there remain myriad open conjectures and unanswered question in this field of mathematics.<br/><br/>There has been an explosion of activity within four-dimensional topology in the last few years, particularly in the study of diffeomorphism groups of four-manifolds, the construction and detection of exotic structures and embeddings, and the introduction of trisections as a new tool in the field. The purpose of this conference is to gather an international group of experts to explore these recent developments in the study of four-dimensional manifolds, disseminate contemporary research in the field, promote the research of early-career mathematicians working in the field, include and promote the research of mathematicians from underrepresented groups, and to give a venue for new collaborations to occur and old collaborations to continue.<br/><br/>Conference Website: https://math.stanford.edu/~maggiehm/developmentsin4D<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the study of fluid flows, parameters arise that capture the ability of the fluid to generate friction by shearing against itself or quantify how temperature differences within the fluid can drive its motion, such as when the sun heats the ocean and a flame heats a pot of water, or more generally represent external sources of energy, such as disturbances in the atmosphere due to large-scale disruptive volcanic eruptions and anthropogenic greenhouse gas effects. The role of these parameters is crucial in the understanding of turbulence, climate dynamics, and other engineering applications. Their precise determination is obtained empirically through the collection of data. Often the data collected is incomplete or corrupted by noise that may arise from the measurement procedure, or the devices used. This project systematically addresses the issue of the accurate estimation of parameters in the context of fluid flows, through the mathematical analysis and computational study of a data-driven approach geared to identify conditions under which recovery of the parameters can be provably guaranteed in several suitably idealized practical situations. The project also builds infrastructure for harnessing the data revolution through course redevelopment, provides training and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and fosters a robust and diverse mathematical culture through a peer mentorship program.<br/> <br/>The project will carry out a mathematical study of a data-driven dynamical algorithm for recovering unknown parameters arising in partial differential equations of hydrodynamics via a paradigm of feedback control. In this approach, observations on the system are directly inserted into the prognostic equation as an exogenous term that enforces convergence towards the observations. Several practical scenarios of parameter estimation are conceived and systematically analyzed, which include the simultaneous recovery of multiple parameters and the use of various modes of observations. A key property underpinning the success of this strategy is the existence of a known nonlinear mechanism found in a large class of dissipative systems that allows small scale information to be asymptotically enslaved to large scale information. The application of this property to parameter estimation is novel. As a result, this study will shed light on the role of this mechanism for parameter estimation in contexts beyond fluid flow and provide a comprehensive exploration of the robustness and limitations of this approach.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Antiferromagnetic materials are important for speeding up development of spintronics because they have unique advantages over ferromagnetic materials due to their much faster spin precession dynamics and absence of spontaneous magnetic moment. However, research on antiferromagnetic thin films has been scarce. In this project, the research team comprising world leading experts elucidates important and challenging fundamental issues in thin film antiferromagnetic materials using high-quality materials synthesis, detection of antiferromagnetic spin currents using terahertz sources, antiferromagnetic domain imaging, and terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. The experimental work is complemented with theory calculations. Graduate and undergraduate students including those from including underrepresented minorities are trained with the knowledge and skills needed for future employment in the information technology industry. <br/><br/>Technical Description<br/>Due to the orders of magnitude faster spin dynamics and absence of spontaneous magnetic moment, thin film antiferromagnets present tremendous challenges in obtaining basic static and dynamic spin properties such as the antiferromagnetic ordering temperature, magnetic anisotropy, magnon dispersion, and damping parameter. In this research, a number of challenging issues are tackled using a suite of powerful capabilities developed in-house or available through collaborations with the world leading experts. These include epitaxial thin film and heterostructure growth by pulsed laser deposition and molecular beam epitaxy, detection of antiferromagnetic spin currents via spin Seebeck effect and terahertz spin pumping using both solid state terahertz source and free-electron laser, antiferromagnetic domain imaging with scanning diamond Nitrogen Vacancy-center microscope, and terahertz time-domain spectroscopy. The antiferromagnetic material properties are analyzed in conjunction with density functional theory. Specifically, the project follows the following plan: (1) grow high-quality epitaxial antiferromagnetic thin films and heterostructures for accurately determining and efficiently manipulating the antiferromagnetic order parameter; (2) generate, transport, and electrically detect spin currents in antiferromagnetic thin films both thermally and resonantly to obtain anisotropy, exchange strength, and damping parameters; and (3) control antiferromagnetic static and dynamic properties via growth and external stimuli.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They were introduced in the 1930s in order to provide a mathematical foundation for quantum mechanics. Since then, the theory of von Neumann algebras has flourished into an independent area with fruitful connections to several areas of mathematics and science, including quantum physics. Von Neumann algebras arise naturally from a variety of mathematical structures, such as groups of symmetries and actions, which are present in many areas of mathematics. Their study is closely connected to topics in group theory and ergodic theory. This project will deepen the connections between these areas and operator algebras, by investigating a number of open problems at their interface. The project will also provide opportunities for the training and professional development of graduate students.<br/><br/>The aim of this project is to expand the scope of rigidity in von Neumann algebras and uncover new applications to group theory, ergodic theory and C*-algebras. The first objective of the project is to investigate rigidity for group von Neumann algebras. Building on recent work on Connes' famous 1980 rigidity conjecture, the PI proposes to find new families of property (T) groups which are rigid in the context of von Neumann algebras and measure equivalence. The second objective of the project is to investigate two related rigidity properties for groups: Hilbert-Schmidt stability and the local lifting property for full group C*-algebras. The PI proposes to investigate two longstanding problems concerning almost commuting matrices and the local lifting property. The third objective of the project is to study asymptotic problems of von Neumann algebras. The proposed research is expected to lead to new interactions between operator algebras, (both geometric and measured) group theory and ergodic theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is a critical process by which students make sense of ideas ? particularly from source texts ? and bring them to bear to demonstrate their emerging understanding of concepts and to make sound arguments. Recognizing the importance of argumentative writing, multiple educational technologies driven by natural language processing (NLP) have been developed to support students and teachers in these processes. However, evidence is modest that such systems improve writing skills, and this is especially the case for younger students. One reason is that NLP technologies have only recently matured to the point that it is possible to provide feedback keyed to the content of students? writing. A second reason is that many students lack the strategic knowledge and skills needed to revise their essays even after receiving writing feedback. An educational technology that assesses students? skill at revising their writing and that provides feedback on their revision attempts would support the development of this critical skill, while placing no additional burden on teachers. Such a technology has the potential to prepare a new generation of students for productively writing and revising argumentative essays, a skill they will need in order to be prepared for the educational and workplace settings of the future.<br/><br/>To address the limitations of existing educational technologies for writing, the research team will develop a system that leverages NLP to provide students with formative feedback on the quality of their revisions. The team will 1) develop and establish the reliability and validity of new measures of revision quality in response to formative feedback on evidence use, 2) use NLP to automate the scoring of revisions using these measures, 3) provide formative feedback to students based on the automated revision scoring, and 4) evaluate the utility of this feedback in improving student writing and revision in classroom settings. The team hypothesizes that such a system will improve students? implementation of feedback messages on text-based argument writing, leading toward more successful revision and ultimately more successful writing. For learning researchers and educators, the revision quality measures will provide detailed information about how students implement formative feedback. Few summative or formative assessments currently exist that provide this type of information. For technology researchers, the automated revision scoring will extend prior writing analysis research in novel ways, e.g., by assessing the quality of revisions between essay drafts and by incorporating alignment with prior formative feedback into the assessment. Multiple types of NLP models will be developed to examine tradeoffs between model type and differing evaluation dimensions such as reliability, transparency, and fairness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They can concentrate light into extremely small dimensions and significantly enhance the light intensity. The unique properties of plasmonic nanostructures have produced many applications, including solar energy harvesting, biomedical sensing, diagnostics and therapy. The objective of this project is to establish a framework based on deep learning, a subset of artificial intelligence, to elucidate and control the physical properties of plasmonic nanostructures by fusing theory, computation, deep learning algorithms, and experiments. Recent work has demonstrated that deep learning can discover the highly complicated and non-intuitive relationships between photonic structures and their properties through extensive data, overcoming the limitations of conventional analytical and numerical methods. To further advance this emergent field, the PI will enhance the capability of deep learning models by considering more degrees of freedom, such as electric and magnetic field distributions, time-dependent responses, and multi-physics processes in plasmonic nanostructures.

The inside of our cells is a crowded three-dimensional mesh which can restructure dynamically as needed. Physicists' current understanding of transport processes of small (micron-sized) particles is insufficient to explain what is actually observed when cells are placed under a microscope. This project will create ""toy models"" of cells on microscope slides and measure both the transport of small particles as well as the mechanical response of the sample corresponding to the different kinds of physical mechanisms driving the transport. In this way, the research team will empirically determine critical parameters needed to improve scientific models and theories on intracellular transport processes. Additionally, to help train, inspire, and diversify the next generation of scientists, each summer the principal investigator will volunteer with an existing pre-college outreach program to provide research opportunities to six high-achieving but underprivileged tenth-graders from the Los Angeles metropolitan area. They will then be mentored by faculty and current undergraduate students at Scripps College through their college applications and beyond.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to advance our understanding of the relationship between transport and mechanical properties within an active, biomimetic material far from equilibrium. Eukaryotic cells rely on targeted transport of molecules from < 1 nm to as large as > 1 ?m across tens of microns in a dynamic, complex, and crowded environment to sustain life. In particular, molecules are corralled, mixed, and separated by emergent transport mechanisms where non-equilibrium dynamics and steric effects arising from molecular crowding both play crucial roles. The research team will create fully-tunable crowded and non-equilibrium biomimetic environments on microscope slides and simultaneously characterize the passive and active transport, network connectivity, force response, and viscoelastic moduli using a custom-developed optical trapping capable lightsheet microscope.

Epoxides and oxaziridines are strained three-membered rings that are widely employed in synthetic chemistry. The catalysts will be based on iron or other first-row transition metals since these are inexpensive and earth abundant. The metals will have chiral ligands (i.e. possessing handedness) so that only one enantiomer (mirror-image form) of the product is formed during the reaction. Selectively forming a single enantiomer of the epoxide or oxaziridine target is critical for many biological and medicinal applications. The synthesis of the ligands is modular, so many different sized chiral pockets can be prepared. To accelerate the research, the team will use computational chemistry to better understand reaction mechanism and assist in improving catalytic turnover and potentially help guide chiral ligand design. This project aims to develop among the most enantioselective iron catalysts for such alkene epoxidation/aziridination reactions across a broad class of reagents. If successful, such iron-based catalyst will be highly valuable for the synthetic chemistry community. The team will also conduct summer programs for graduate student training including in-person international exchange programs and online graduate preparatory training for students beginning their PhD studies.<br/><br/>The collaborative team of David Jenkins and Konstantinos Vogiatzis of the University of Tennessee will study catalytic reactions for the formation of epoxides and oxaziridines. Their fundamental aspiration of this project is to develop effective chiral catalytic epoxidation and oxaziridination reactions that work with a wide variety of prochiral substrates such as olefins and imines.  In particular, they will develop catalysts based upon iron and other first-row transition metals that react with an oxidant and aliphatic alkenes to produce chiral epoxides. At present, there are no enantioselective iron catalysts that react with this combination of reagents to give enantio-enriched epoxide. To achieve these goals the Jenkins group will develop new synthetic methodology to generate chiral NHC macrocycles that are structurally analogous to the more well-known porphyrins. These D2-symmetric macrocycles have modular chiral pockets that can potentially be tuned through coordination with a class of chiral diimidazole ligands. The Vogiatzis group will lead the computational research component with regard to a virtual pre-screening of different NHC-ligand scaffolds for enantioselective catalysis.

The success of this project would significantly enhance the understanding of the function of side chains in balancing the solubility of conjugated polymers and the thermal stability of such polymer-based solar cells, and result in polymer solar cells of improved thermal stability and high efficiency. All participants in this project will have the opportunity for interdisciplinary learning from synthesis to device fabrication, as well as sophisticated characterization tools via a number of established collaborations.  The PI's group will actively recruit and train students of diverse backgrounds, in addition to conducting outreach activities for the general public and K-12 students.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Typically, conjugated polymers used in high efficiency solar cells often show low glass transition temperatures, leading to instability of such solar cells during operation by heat. Thermally removing cleavable side chains is an effective approach to offer the necessary solubility of conjugated polymers during solution processing, and re-gain the high glass transition temperature of conjugated polymers via thermal removal of side chains after the film formation. The You group recently proposed a balanced approach where some side chains would be cleaved to gain morphological stability while keeping other side chains to maintain the pre-established morphology to largely retain the efficiency. The objectives of this project are: (1) to design the synthesis of poly(thiophene)s with cleavable side chains and unsubstituted thiophene units to further improve the efficiency and stability, (2) to develop milder methods for cleaving alkyl chains to minimize the thermal impact on morphology, (3) to conduct morphological investigations to develop structure-morphology-stability-efficiency relationships within these model systems, and (4) to explore the cleavable side chains in high-performance conjugated polymers and small molecule acceptors to achieve high device efficiency and high morphological stability. The success of this project would lead to development of a low-temperature process to achieve the cleavage of side chains, achieving PSCs of high morphological stability and high efficiency, and elucidating the structure-morphology-stability-efficiency relationships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such cloud-native databases have unique architectural features compared to conventional on-premises databases, such as high scalability, elasticity, and availability. These new architectural features bring new challenges and opportunities for performance optimizations. This project will investigate new algorithms and system designs that better leverage the unique architectures in the cloud, and improve performance, cost-effectiveness, and reliability. The project will advance the understanding of cloud-native databases and add significant value to society at large.

Solutions containing salt, including acids and bases, are essential in many chemical, biological, and environmental processes, and the rates of ion transport are especially relevant to emerging battery technologies employing aqueous electrolytes. However, the detailed molecular mechanism for ion transport, including the role of counterions and ion-pairing, is not fully understood. Thus, the research objective of this project is to explore ionic mobility in water at the molecular level to achieve a unified understanding of the role of counterions and ion-pairing on the structure, dynamics, and mechanisms of ion transport in aqueous acids, bases, and salts. In addition to the broader scientific impacts of the work, the project also includes advanced training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as the development of a related laboratory experiment for high school students. <br/><br/>Preliminary findings that counterions substantially impact hydroxide mobility suggest that ion-pairing effects are central to acid, base, and salt mobility. This project involves a systematic study of Hofmeister series ions in acid, base, and salt solutions as a function of concentration. Experimentally, diffusion constants are measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and a combination of Raman and infrared spectroscopy elucidate information about ion structure, hydration, and proton delocalization. Complementary nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements yield proton transfer rates and information about the mobility of individual ions. Theoretically, the acids and bases are simulated with ab initio molecular dynamics and the salts with molecular dynamics. Calculations based on the simulations provide the free energy of association between respective ion pairs and aid the interpretation of the experimental Raman and infrared spectra. The spectroscopic and simulation studies synergistically combine to provide a molecular-level understanding of diffusion constant measurements. The combined studies elucidate the impact of counterions on the Grotthuss mechanism of proton hopping and the particular roles of solvent-shared versus contact ion-pairing in aqueous electrolyte solutions. The broader impacts of the work include the importance of better understanding ion mobility for many technological applications, advanced student training opportunities, and development and implementation of a high school laboratory experiment that explores ion-pairing at hydrophobic interfaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, there are many situations where physical limitations result in the loss of important aspects of those measurements.  This imposes constraints on which frames can be used for the analysis of a signal, and different algorithms are required for reconstruction based only on partial information. For example, phase retrieval is applied in X-ray crystallography and coherent diffraction imaging where scientists are only able to identify the magnitude (or intensity) of each linear measurement of a signal. A different scenario occurs when using sensors with a fixed range, such as a pixel in a digital camera.  In this case, any measurement with an intensity above the range saturates the sensor which then outputs the maximum value.  In both situations, we can formalize the physical limitations imposed by the measurement process as applying a non-linear operator to a sequence of linear measurements.  Although these non-linear operators are very simple, the loss of linearity can cause significant difficulty for signal reconstruction in high dimensions which becomes further confounded in the presence of error.  These kinds of reconstruction scenarios arise naturally in many circumstances, and researchers in a variety of disciplines have developed solutions for specific applications.  This makes the mathematical foundation for solving these types of inverse questions particularly important, and has led to significant research being devoted to the mathematics of phase retrieval in particular.   The investigators and their students are working on a unique approach to expanding the mathematical theory of phase retrieval and saturation recovery by using a combination of techniques from frame theory, probability, and the geometry of Banach spaces.  <br/><br/>Both phase retrieval and saturation recovery require the redundancy of a frame, and are not possible with a basis.  One component of the project concerns identifying the exact amount of redundancy which is necessary to do phase retrieval or saturation recovery using a frame or fusion frame.  The second component considers a generalization of the phase retrieval scenario to the setting of subspaces of Banach lattices where the goal is to identify a vector in a subspace from its absolute value.  This connection allows for established techniques in Banach lattices to prove new theorems about phase retrieval, and also opens a new line of inquiry in the theory of Banach lattices itself.  It is not only important for phase retrieval to be possible, but for phase retrieval to be stable under error.  The best known methods for constructing frames for high dimensional spaces which do stable phase retrieval are random constructions which achieve a certain stability bound with high probability.  It is much easier to construct continuous frames which do stable phase retrieval with a certain stability bound, but discrete frames are better suited for computations.  Because of this, important parts of the project involve both (1) determining when a continuous frame may be sampled to construct a frame with given frame bounds which does phase retrieval with a given stability bound and (2) using probabilistic methods to determine when a continuous frame may be randomly sampled to achieve such a frame with high probability. The final component of the project introduces phase retrieval for vector bundles over manifolds.  That is, instead of recovering a single vector up to a phase factor from the magnitude of its frame coefficients, the goal is to use a continuously moving frame to recover a section of a vector bundle up to an equivalence relation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major challenge is that anxiety disorders develop from disruptions in highly interconnected groups of brain areas, which are referred to as neural circuits, and the appropriate technologies to characterize these neural circuits are lacking. This CAREER project will develop and leverage a neural interface technology to characterize neural circuits impacted by anxiety disorders. Ultimately the work will increase understanding of neural mechanisms underscoring anxiety-related behavior and potentially lead to new treatment options. The research objectives in this proposal are integrated with an educational and outreach plan to increase visibility and training in neuroengineering. Specifically, the plan includes the following activities: establishing a neuroengineering research concentration; experiential learning and mentoring opportunities for women and underrepresented minorities; interactive and remote learning outreach activities; and multidisciplinary training for graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The shortcomings of existing therapies for neuropsychiatric illnesses, such as anxiety, highlight the urgent need to better understand functional interactions in the affected neural circuits. The goal of this CAREER project is to develop a transformative multimodal neural interface fabrication process and design that will pave the way for establishing neural circuit mechanisms of anxiety-related behavior. Existing multimodal neural interfaces typically leverage manual assembly techniques that are not practically scalable and fail to reach brain areas beyond the superficial cortex. These shortcomings will be addressed by two foci. The Engineering Focus will develop microfabrication and microassembly processes for a neural interface design that can be easily optimized to different applications. The advantages of developing these processes include greater device yield, lower variation in fabricated devices, and design scalability to high channel counts. This work also distinguishes itself from the state-of-the-art in its holistic design that leverages a highly biocompatible material that easily integrates with the fabrication pipeline and is appropriate for multimodal functionality. Under the Biological Focus, the deep penetrating neural interface will be used to examine how approach-avoidance choice information is represented and communicated across relevant neural circuitry and implement an electrical neuromodulation paradigm to establish causal circuit mechanisms underlying aberrant changes in anxiety-related behavior. The knowledge gained through this work will provide a fundamentally new strategy to develop scalable multimodal neural interfaces and lay the foundation for neural circuit-level characterizations of any neurological condition ? ultimately leading to new neuromodulatory interventions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PI and his coauthors have developed the basic theory of feasible regions for both hypergraphs and induced graphs in a series of papers. Still, many foundational issues remain unresolved and settling these could be considered one of the main thrusts of this project.  In the second area, the PI plans to work on fundamental problems in Ramsey theory. The main problems that will be explored here are the determination of the tower growth rates of diagonal and off-diagonal classical hypergraph Ramsey numbers, as well as of the closely related Erdos-Hajnal function.

Solutions containing salt, including acids and bases, are essential in many chemical, biological, and environmental processes, and the rates of ion transport are especially relevant to emerging battery technologies employing aqueous electrolytes. However, the detailed molecular mechanism for ion transport, including the role of counterions and ion-pairing, is not fully understood. Thus, the research objective of this project is to explore ionic mobility in water at the molecular level to achieve a unified understanding of the role of counterions and ion-pairing on the structure, dynamics, and mechanisms of ion transport in aqueous acids, bases, and salts. In addition to the broader scientific impacts of the work, the project also includes advanced training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students, as well as the development of a related laboratory experiment for high school students. <br/><br/>Preliminary findings that counterions substantially impact hydroxide mobility suggest that ion-pairing effects are central to acid, base, and salt mobility. This project involves a systematic study of Hofmeister series ions in acid, base, and salt solutions as a function of concentration. Experimentally, diffusion constants are measured by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy, and a combination of Raman and infrared spectroscopy elucidate information about ion structure, hydration, and proton delocalization. Complementary nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy measurements yield proton transfer rates and information about the mobility of individual ions. Theoretically, the acids and bases are simulated with ab initio molecular dynamics and the salts with molecular dynamics. Calculations based on the simulations provide the free energy of association between respective ion pairs and aid the interpretation of the experimental Raman and infrared spectra. The spectroscopic and simulation studies synergistically combine to provide a molecular-level understanding of diffusion constant measurements. The combined studies elucidate the impact of counterions on the Grotthuss mechanism of proton hopping and the particular roles of solvent-shared versus contact ion-pairing in aqueous electrolyte solutions.

The scarcity of exposed rock outcrop in Antarctica, which is 98% ice-covered, makes previously collected rock samples very valuable to the science community in disciplines like long term climate change, planetary science, paleontology, geology, marine science, and more. The U.S. Polar Rock Repository was established at the Ohio State University in 2003 to meet the need for preserving rock, dredge, and terrestrial core samples from polar areas. The Polar Rock Repository seeks out, accepts, and curates geological samples collected primarily from Antarctica and the southern oceans. The existence of the Polar Rock Repository allows samples collected at a high financial cost to be used to their full scientific potential. Currently more than 55,000 samples are available as no-cost loans for research, education, and museum exhibits. In addition to the physical samples, the repository archives supporting materials from the collector, such as images of the samples, field maps, air photos, thin sections, and any associated bibliography/Digital Object Identifiers. Scientists, graduate students, and undergraduate students routinely use samples from the Polar Rock Repository for their research projects. The Polar Rock Repository also freely loans an educational 'rock box' that contains representative rock, fossil and mineral samples, books and activities about geology and Antarctica to pre-college teachers from across the United States.  The Polar Rock Repository recently developed a ?virtual rock box? to allow similar activities to occur outside of the classroom.<br/><br/>The U.S. Polar Rock Repository (PRR) provides stewardship of polar rock sample collections and metadata. It is one of the few lending rock repositories to allow destructive research techniques to be used on samples. The PRR website and in-house digital metadata archive provides for global dissemination of data and a unique resource for pilot studies, proposal preparation and field logistics planning. The PRR provides free, full and open access to metadata and collections. Over the course of this award, the PRR will work proactively with the research community to acquire scientifically valuable rock collections and supplementary materials that will enhance the PRR collection. Samples will be cataloged following standard curatorial practices and will be made discoverable through the public facing portion of the Collections Management system developed at the Byrd Polar Climate and Research Center. The preservation of these physical samples, along with archiving of associated metadata, and inclusion of Digital Object Identifiers in a discoverable online database, allows for transparency and reproducibility in polar earth science research. The Collections Management System will continue to be updated and improved. The Curator will continue to advance the discoverability of the PRR by attending meetings, creating a webinar and contacting scientists about new collections at the facility. The PRR will continue to fulfill loans of samples and enhance the links with other repositories and data management entities to better enable interdisciplinary research. Educational outreach to pre-college schools will continue with the 'polar rock box' being freely available to schools with in the United States.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A prominent paradigm to address racial bias has been to create opportunities for people of different races to have contact with each other. Interracial contact can be an efficient intervention, but it is unlikely to work as intended without a firm understanding of the exact conditions that reduce racial bias. How deep must contact be? Is it sufficient for people in one group to merely see those of other groups, without any effort to recognize each person (i.e., mere exposure)? Is it necessary to see individuals frequently enough to recognize them without knowing anything else about them (i.e., perceptual individuation)? Or is it essential to interact with someone enough to acquire personal information about them (i.e., knowledge-based individuation)? This project provides a rigorous analysis of these three forms of interracial contact to test whether the extent of contact ? while holding constant positivity of contact ? can influence peoples' perceptions and evaluations of others, which can have downstream consequences for reducing racial prejudice.<br/><br/>The primary aim of this project is to examine how different forms of contact shape racial bias on visual perception of faces, spontaneous judgments, evaluations, and beliefs. Study 1 tests how naturally occurring experiences of interracial contact over a lifetime account for the categorization and evaluation of racial information and for beliefs about other racial groups. Study 2 examines the same categorizations, evaluations, and beliefs, while experimentally manipulating the type of exposure to others. Study 3 utilizes pupillometry and eye-tracking methods to indicate the salience of others' faces after having different forms of contact. Together these studies stand to transform our understanding of whether, how, and why interracial contact could be an effective way to reduce racial prejudice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The latter field, which studies the deformation of physical materials and bodies in response to stress and strain, is informed by developments in materials science and physics. A common challenge faced in the development of mathematical models of nonlinear elasticity is how to account for the physical impossibility of compressing a portion of an elastic body of positive volume into a space of zero volume. From a mathematical point of view, serious difficulties arise when trying to overcome the lack of injectivity as postulated by the physical principle of non-interpenetration of matter. While homeomorphic solutions would be ideal models, mathematical constraints linked to the necessity of complying with the aforementioned physical principle lead naturally to the conclusion that limits of homeomorphic solutions must be allowed as legitimate competitors. New analytic and geometric tools have been developed to accommodate these difficulties, and those tools will be developed further and in greater detail in this project. The project will also afford research opportunities for early career mathematicians, including graduate students.<br/><br/>Weak limits of energy-minimizing sequences of Sobolev homeomorphisms are natural candidates of energy-minimizers. In two dimensions, weak and strong limits coincide and characterize the class of monotone Sobolev mappings.

Serious challenges arise in the investigation of energy-minimal solutions solely based on inner-variational equations. This project is largely concerned with questions similar in spirit to the Riemann conformal mapping problem. Such variational questions also lead to associated Sobolev mapping problems and, in the case of prescribed boundary values, require a preliminary investigation of Sobolev variants of the Jordan-Schoenflies theorem.

In addition to the tragic loss of human life, such events have a devastating effect on animals and plants. One challenge for biologists is to understand how species will respond to such climatic events ? if they can cope or if they will go extinct. To meet this challenge, researchers must identify what biological changes occur following extreme climatic events. This project seeks to understand how populations of tailed frogs, which are found in cold streams of the Pacific Northwest, have coped in the aftermath of a large fire and heatwave. The research team had been studying the physiology and  genetics of tailed frogs in this region for 4 years before the fire and heatwave occurred in 2020-2021. Only a year and a half after these events, the researchers will measure what physiological, genetic, and other changes have occurred in the frog populations. This will allow the researchers to 1) understand how the frog responded to extreme climatic events, 2) predict how they will respond in the future, and 3) present their findings to local land managers to discuss possible conservation strategies for frogs and other freshwater aquatic species in the area, and 4) train a postdoctoral and undergraduate researcher.               <br/><br/><br/>Species can respond to extreme climatic events via plasticity and/or adaptation. How populations respond may depend on the magnitude and severity of environmental change, although investigations of responses to extreme climatic events are rare. For four years, the researchers have been studying the thermal sensitivity and adaptive capacity of coastal tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei), a dominant herbivore in fast-flowing streams in the Pacific Northwest, to predict their responses to climate change. They have measured stream thermal characteristics, tadpole thermal physiology, and identified genomic markers associated with those variables. In 2020, an intense forest fire burned on top of two of the study streams. A year later, an unprecedented heatwave impacted all of the sites. The proposed research will test hypotheses about changes that have occurred at the environmental, physiological, and genomic levels in response to these climatic events. This research will (i) identify patterns of thermal physiological change in fire- and heatwave-affected populations, (ii) test for signatures of genetically-based adaptation to the fire and heatwave, and (iii) integrate physiological and genomic findings to predict the degree to which persistence of populations changes as a result of each extreme climatic event.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While Algebraic Geometry has often been considered a solely pure area of mathematics, the community of researchers of CCAAGS-22 promotes its applied and computational nature. Participants of CCAAGS-22 combine Algebraic Geometry with the techniques and methods from symbolic and numeric computation, algorithms, complexity theory, as well as problems motivated by applications in multiple fields. These methods have already seen applications in biology, coding theory, cryptography, combustion, computational geometry, computer graphics, quantum computing, control theory, geometric design, complexity theory, machine learning, nonlinear partial differential equations, optimization, robotics, and statistics, among others. The interaction between algebraic geometry and any of these other disciplines is beneficial for both sides.<br/><br/>This conference brings together researchers and promotes interdisciplinary work in a fast growing area. After the lack of contact during the pandemic, this is a long overdue event. It is particularly useful for junior researchers whose careers strongly depend on making connections and networking.

Beliefs in causal explanations (for example, investing in new technologies will cause your available money for retirement to increase) guide which behaviors to engage in for the future (e.g., invest in crypto-currency). But people can ? and often do ? believe causal explanations of the world that are wrong. Understanding what in the nature of an incorrect causal explanation makes it believable is critically important for teaching people to reject incorrect explanations of events. In this work, the PIs investigate what makes incorrect causal explanations of events appealing to people and what encourages the adoption of these misplaced beliefs. Holding incorrect causal explanations can have critically damaging effects, such as people pursuing health treatments that are ineffective or investing in financial strategies that do not pay out. It is therefore important to better understand what makes incorrect causal explanations appealing so strategies can be deployed to counteract their adoption. In the work, the PIs conduct a series of studies to provide a strong understanding of what in the nature of a causal explanation makes it appealing. Across studies, the PIs explore many different causal elements of explanations. Using their results, the PIs then make a preliminary attempt to reduce endorsement of incorrect causal explanations. This research has a broader impact on science by involving students in research that has a strong translational component. Such research helps students connect science to the real-world, growing their interest in science and critical thinking at large. Additionally, the proposed work will have broader impacts on science literacy by isolating what in scientific explanations may make them more or less likely to be believed. <br/><br/>The PIs use psychological methods from the causal explanation literature to study perceptions of a wide range of misplaced and incorrect causal explanations. These methods include having people read explanations and rate how compelling, satisfying, and believable the explanations are. In addition, participants in these studies make judgments about the causal structure of the explanations, such as how many causal factors the explanations include, how complex the explanations are, and how many events the explanations can explain. The PIs use large samples of online participants to ensure that people with many different beliefs are being included in the studies. In each study, the PIs have participants rate incorrect causal explanations (e.g., ?eating sugar is the main cause of type 2 diabetes?) as well as fact-based causal explanations of the same events (e.g., ?type 2 diabetes has multiple causes, including being overweight and having a genetic predisposition?). This comparison allows for isolation of what is unique about misplaced explanations. Using machine learning, the researchers investigate the degree to which there are characteristic structures of factual and misinformation explanations, beyond how they are perceived (e.g., the complexity of causal structure), which may allow for more automatic differentiation between these explanation types. Finally, the PIs use their findings to create a set of behavioral studies where they alter how explanations are presented to explore the degree to which presentation impacts endorsement of the explanations. Specifically, the PIs create new causal explanations that manipulate the causal elements that were most predictive of endorsement for incorrect causal beliefs in earlier experiments (e.g., complexity, number of causal factors). The goal is to see if by changing these important causal elements, endorsement of incorrect beliefs can be reduced. Through these studies we can learn more generally how to prevent the uptake of incorrect information in favor of fact-based explanations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These are complicated decisions that impact homeowners and communities for many years. Such decisions are influenced by many factors, including household income, access to insurance, location of employment, the need for local services such as medical care or schools, and connections to family and friends. One underlying factor that affects all these others is place attachment, or the emotional and functional ties that people have to the place where they live. This study focuses on understanding how place attachment influences the decisions people make after disasters, specifically decisions about where they live and whether they invest in measures that reduce their risk to future disasters. Focused on three California counties that have been affected by recent, major wildfires, findings from this study will help local governments and practitioners develop programs that better support households that are affected by disasters and inform community planning for hazards associated with climate change.<br/><br/>This study investigates the role of place attachment in residential adjustment after wildfires. Households affected by wildfires face a critical decision point: do they rebuild in the same way, rebuild with new mitigation efforts, or relocate? Relatively few studies have examined the factors that influence these residential decision-making processes, particularly the role of intangible factors like place attachment. This study addresses these critical gaps in our understanding, with the goals of: (1) investigating residential adjustment among homeowners affected by recent California wildfires, (2) examining the role of place attachment in post-disaster residential adjustment, and (3) assessing the extent to which current place attachment measures capture the observed dynamics of place attachment in disaster contexts. Using three California counties as study sites, and building on a pilot study in these same, fire-affected communities, the research team will use photovoice method and phenomenological analyses to develop a deep, contextually grounded understanding of the role of place attachment in residential decisions. Additionally, the team will use qualitative comparative analysis to examine commonalities in household adjustment pathways after disaster. Study findings will advance both the theoretical and practical understanding of place attachment in mitigation and recovery. Given that place attachment is a foundational construct tied to many other aspects of recovery decision-making, this will be a critical contribution for US communities given the increasing losses to wildfire and other climate-induced disasters. Furthermore, study findings will contribute meaningfully to housing recovery policy, adaptation policy, and recovery and relocation practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PETM was caused by the release of greenhouse gases (including carbon dioxide and/or methane) to the atmosphere and oceans. Earth system models have been employed to constrain the magnitude, timing, and impacts of PETM carbon emissions. However, the contribution of carbon cycle feedbacks to the severity of environmental changes across the PETM remains unclear. One key gap is how the terrestrial carbon cycle responded to PETM global change. This project will add a representation of the terrestrial carbon cycle to an intermediate complexity Earth system model. That model will simulate the cycling of carbon dioxide and methane between vegetation, soils, the atmosphere, and the oceans. This study will place new constraints on the sensitivity of Earth?s carbon cycle to carbon release and global warming. In addition, this project will support research experiences at UC Riverside for undergraduate students from Riverside Community College. These internships are a cornerstone of UC Riverside?s Geoscience Development program. That program targets the critical juncture between community college and 4-year programs with the goal of building a diverse population of undergraduates in the geosciences. <br/><br/>Carbon cycle feedbacks are a key source of uncertainty in future climate change projections. Study of past global warming episodes, like the PETM, has the potential to provide crucial insight into the operation of these feedbacks on a warm Earth. By adding a representation of the terrestrial carbon cycle to an intermediate complexity Earth system model configured for the late Paleocene, the proposed research will allow evaluation of the time-dependent response of potential carbon cycle feedbacks in response to higher atmospheric CO2 and higher global temperature. In addition, the proposed research will update a current representation of ocean and atmosphere methane cycling with a modeled representation of the terrestrial production and oxidation of methane. This updated model, cGENIE-ENTS, will be used to evaluate multiple proposed PETM carbon emissions scenarios, including comparison of model output against available proxy datasets. The computational efficiency of the cGENIE-ENTS model will allow experiments to be run for the entire ~200 kyr PETM duration and thus evaluate not only the potential for terrestrial carbon cycle feedbacks during the onset of the event, but also their potential role in determining the timescale of Earth system recovery. All model components will be coupled during model integration, producing consistent output for the response of both the terrestrial and marine carbon cycle through time. New PETM simulations will provide revised estimates for PETM carbon emissions and provide constraints on the feedback behavior (both positive and negative) of the terrestrial biosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result of the strong attraction between the positive and negative charges, most ionic compounds (like table salt) are solids at room temperature.  This is not always the case, however.  In some cases, the positive and negative ions can exist as a liquid at room temperature, despite the strong forces. These ionic liquids have unique properties that can be harnessed for a variety of applications. Unfortunately, there are only a few examples, which makes it difficult to adjust their properties for specific needs.  In solvate ionic liquids (SILs), solvent-like molecules are stuck to the positive ions, resulting in a novel mixture that has ionic liquid-like properties, but which can be chemically tuned. Professors Kuroda, Kumar and Jorn are combining computer simulation with experimental measurement to determine how the molecular packing of the ions in the liquid influences their properties. Their discoveries could have impact on many technologies, including next generation batteries needed for clean energy storage. The project is also providing research opportunities for students who will become the next generation of scientists and engineers. In addition, this work impacts the general community through a simple educational outreach project entitled ""The Po?boy Battery"" (named after the famous Louisiana sandwich), in which middle and high school students build a functional battery from common household materials.<br/><br/>The research team is advancing the field of solvate ionic liquids via the development of an integrated computational - experimental formalism spanning multiple length scales. The synergy connects the nanoscale molecular environments of candidate SILs to emergent behavior at the mesoscale and their stability at metal surfaces. These connections are achieved by combining molecular based experiments (such as conventional and time resolved infrared spectroscopy) with atomistic simulations, electrochemical experiments, and coarse-grained modeling. The framework developed in this proposal is elucidating a greater understanding of solvate ionic liquids, thereby directly impacting rapidly growing areas such as the development of new solvents for organic synthesis and next-generation energy storage electrolytes.

The mathematical theory of singular integrals has traditionally been formulated in smooth geometric settings. However, demand for an understanding of singular integrals in rougher settings has grown recently with a more refined understanding of mathematical models for physical phenomena in irregular or non-smooth environments. Emerging applications of singular integrals in quantum computing further buttress the need for such extensions of the classical theory. Notably, the relationship between singular integrals and the geometry of sets and measures facilitates a new understanding of dimension reduction for high-dimensional point sets, that is, mechanisms to detect whether large collections of points in a high-dimensional space in fact lie on a smooth lower-dimensional manifold. Results of this nature are important for data science applications, and the project has the potential to bring the toolkit of singular integral theory to bear on this important application domain. By coupling pure harmonic analysis methods with tools from combinatorics and probability, and through its noticeable interface with questions of relevance in data science, the project will also provide opportunities for the training of junior mathematicians, including graduate students.<br/><br/>This project considers a variety of questions in the study of singular integrals in non-smooth or rough settings, using both existing and newly developed tools. The principal investigators have been at the forefront of the past development of such a theory, and the current project will crystallize new applications to other areas of geometry and analysis. Questions under consideration in this project include: (a) a sharp characterization of bounded singular integrals with matrix weight, which is important in the regularity theory of vector stationary stochastic processes, (b) a characterization of weighted boundedness for para-product singular operators on graphs with cycles (multi-trees, Hamming cubes, etc.), and (c) the David-Semmes regularity problem in codimensions larger than one.

Sandy sediments cover about one-third of the continental shelf but are not well studied. Like a sand filter, marine sands separate and trap dissolved and particulate materials as seawater moves through. These processes influence organic matter cycling in sediments. Because smaller particles travel more easily through the pore space than larger ones, they move deeper into the seabed. This causes a separation of particulate matter by size. Likewise, changes in oxygen and dissolved chemicals with depth alter the surface properties of the sediment grains. Molecules with different properties are separated based on these surface characteristics. The fates of organic carbon, dissolved nutrients and pollutants in the coastal ocean are linked to uptake by sediments, physical and microbial processes within sediments, and release. Thus, it is important to understand the processes that control the transport and accumulation of materials in the seabed. This project will study the separation of particulate and dissolved organic matter transported through marine sands. It will provide information critical for understanding the cycling of carbon and nutrients at the seafloor. Graduate and undergraduate students working on this project will receive training in marine sediment functions and state-of-the-art methods that can help solve pressing environmental issues. <br/><br/>The main objectives of this research are to: 1) demonstrate and quantify the chromatographic separation of organic matter in shelf sediments through the analysis of sediment cores from silicate and carbonate sand beds, 2) characterize and quantify the separation process of dissolved and particulate organic matter and identify key factors controlling this separation in the sands, and 3) quantify the influence of organic matter chromatographic separation on sedimentary oxygen consumption and dissolved inorganic carbon production in these sands. The researchers will test the hypothesis that chromatographic separation of particles and solutes takes place in both sand types but differs with respect to the substances affected and the effectiveness of the separation. Intra-grain permeability of biogenic sands can enhance separation in carbonate sands through exclusion chromatography effects. The separation process is expected to enhance decomposition activities through the concentration of degradable materials in specific sediment layers. The research objectives will be addressed with a combination of field and laboratory studies that include tracer experiments and the analysis of dissolved and particulate organic matter distribution in sand sediment cores sampled in the field. Oxygen consumption and dissolved inorganic carbon production will be measured to reveal the relevance of this process for the sedimentary degradation process. The demonstration of chromatographic separation of particles and solutes in marine sands will close a gap in our understanding of the chemical processes that govern the fate of organic matter, nutrients, and pollutants. This project will provide research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students.

Dynamical systems (""dynamics,"" for short) is the study of motion, and in particular motion that is dictated by an unchanging set of rules, such as the forces controlling planetary motion.  Well-known experimental phenomena in dynamics such as chaotic trajectories combined with stable motion have been observed experimentally but are far from being fully understood from a theoretical perspective. The project will address several themes. The first is the stability of dynamical systems - that is, how small perturbations in initial conditions and even in the rules themselves affect the outcome of the evolution. Understanding robust mechanisms for stability is a fundamental pursuit, and the investigator has already discovered several novel such mechanisms.  The second theme is genericity, or loosely to understand what dynamical features are present in a typical system.  The third theme is rigidity, the study of symmetries of dynamical systems and those systems with optimal symmetries, the so-called ideal crystals of dynamics. An important aspect of the project is to further interaction between mathematical and adjacent scientific communities, such as physics.  The PI has already collaborated on questions surrounding the design of particle accelerators and is currently collaborating with a physicist on studying the quantum dynamics behind the emergence of black holes.  Furthermore, the PI has given several public lectures on dynamics and has written in the popular press about the work of mathematicians.  The PI will expand these activities in the coming years. The project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This project considers questions in smooth dynamical systems all the way from a general perspective, in particular those about genericity of certain foliation dynamics, to a local one, focused on the rigidity of specific families of group actions. These questions are motivated by well-known conjectures, but also by the desire to discover and explore new dynamical phenomena. The first circle of questions centers around Boltzmann?s original ergodic hypothesis as well as the modern and related conjectures of Pugh and Shub about stable ergodicity. The basic question they address is when one might expect a dynamical system to be ergodic. An important question that remains open is the symplectic version of the C1 Pugh-Shub conjecture, which the investigator will attack.  The strategy to prove this conjecture involves interesting and timely aspects of the study of hyperbolic and partially hyperbolic dynamics and expanding foliations. A second project investigates the topological and statistical properties of the unstable foliations of partially hyperbolic systems, and in particular Anosov diffeomorphisms with a partially hyperbolic splitting. A third project concerns the rigidity properties of partially hyperbolic abelian actions. Here the action of the su-holonomy group plays an important role: in the actions considered, the joint action of the ambient, partially hyperbolic dynamics and the su-holonomy group are constrained by certain solvable groups for which known rigidity results described above hold.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will encompass the study of the dynamic behavior of mathematical models and applications in areas of ecological and biological systems, wireless communication, financial engineering, networked systems, and systems in control engineering. The research will focus on model systems under the random influence, switching among different configurations, and complex structures. The results will provide an understanding of the fundamental properties and the basic features of such modeling systems. This project will provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students. The research will increase public scientific literacy as well as enhance interdisciplinary collaborations and the STEM workforce.<br/><br/>This project will encompass analysis and computation of several important topics from emerging and existing applications in networked systems, control engineering, optimization of systems, wireless communications, biology, ecology, economics, and social networks. (1) It aims to develop a new methodology for analyzing switching jump-diffusion type Kolmogorov systems. Novel features to be studied include non-local behavior due to the jumps, and uncertain environment modeling using random switching. Long-standing fundamental issues such as minimal conditions needed for persistence and extinction in population dynamics will be addressed. (2) Treating discontinuity in the iterates and non-smooth dynamics in the limits for stochastic approximation algorithms is vitally important. This project will focus on this issue from a new angle. Stochastic differential inclusion limits will be obtained and used to ascertain rates of convergence and to improve asymptotic efficiency for the first time. (3) Although nonlinear filtering is an area deemed to be well developed, computation remains to be the main challenge because of the infinite dimensionality. This project aims to develop a methodology based on machine learning and neural networks with a new approach using adaptive learning rate recursion, leading to potentially more efficient computational methods. (4) A key in numerically solving nonlinear stochastic differential equations is to treat high nonlinearity and numerical finite time explosion. This project will develop a class of algorithms to handle the problem. A novel idea will be the use of randomly generated growing truncation bounds. Convergence and rates of convergence will be developed. (5) In response to the urgent need to handle coupled equations in networks, this project will focus on the study of coupled switching jump diffusions. By using ideas from dynamic systems and coupling methods in probability, this project aims to obtain stability and stabilization with impact on networked systems. Extensive numerical experiments and simulations will be performed to complement the mathematical analysis and algorithm design.

Such geometries arise naturally in areas of mathematics such as several complex variables, partial differential equations (PDE), and algebraic, complex, and differential geometry. This project investigates a particular geometry ? CR geometry -- that arises in the study of several complex variables and complex geometry. It has deep connections with current topics in mathematical physics, including quantum field theory, general relativity, and string theory, as well as applications in, e.g., systems engineering and control theory. For example, the study of obstruction flatness has a direct link to the equations of motion in conformal gravity. The notion of Khler-Einstein metric is highly relevant for these investigations; such metrics are measurements of distance and angle in higher-dimensional spaces (manifolds), which curve according to Einstein?s equations of relativity in vacuum. One way in which CR manifolds arise is as the boundaries of regions in high-dimensional complex spaces which curve in a well-behaved fashion in complex directions; such regions are known as pseudoconvex domains. Techniques to be used in this project come from a variety of mathematical areas: complex analysis/geometry, PDE, and differential geometry. At the same time, techniques and tools developed in this project will influence these areas as well. The project will also provide interesting research topics for graduate students and postdocs. The seminar activity resulting from the project will inspire and stimulate both students and other researchers.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to study geometric, analytic, and algebraic aspects of real submanifolds in complex varieties, together with their symmetries. Such aspects include, for instance, the geometric consequences of global vanishing on a compact CR manifold of a higher order local invariant that arises as an obstruction in the study of a complex Monge--Ampere equation. In three dimensions, this invariant coincides with the trace on the boundary of the log-term in an asymptotic expansion of the Bergman kernel. Solutions to this Monge-Ampere equation give rise to complete Khler-Einstein metrics with negative curvature, and a major goal of the project is to characterize domains and complex manifolds in terms of properties of various metrics and kernels, and their relations. As an example, one aim is to understand what assumptions ensure that the Bergman metric on a domain is Khler-Einstein if and only if the domain is biholomorphically equivalent to the ball. Another topic to be considered is the existence of CR umbilical points on compact CR 3-manifolds. Umbilical points on a manifold are locations where the manifold exhibits an unexpectedly high degree of symmetry and smoothness. It is not known whether such points always exist on bounded strictly pseudoconvex domains in complex 2-dimensional space; this question remains open if the domain is diffeomorphic to the ball. Finally, the project considers existence, uniqueness, and regularity questions for CR maps. These include the study of CR maps between generic submanifolds of infinite type and the recently discovered phenomenon that for infinite type hypersurfaces the biholomorphic, formal, and smooth CR equivalence classifications are distinct. These investigations are expected to shed new light on the nature of CR maps between infinite type manifolds, and to lead to a better understanding of the Pfaffian systems arising in this context. In conclusion, this project will significantly enhance the understanding of the role of invariant objects and symmetries in several complex variables and complex geometry, which in turn will increase the utility of the theory in physical models and applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sometimes they are technical obstacles to overcome, while in other cases they encode essential features of the problem being considered. In this research  the focus is on singularities of minimal submanifolds and of the Lagrangian mean curvature flow. Minimal submanifolds are higher dimensional generalizations of minimal surfaces, which model soap films. Their study is very classical, but some basic questions remain unanswered about their behavior near singularities. Special Lagrangian submanifolds are a particular kind of minimal submanifolds, which have received a great deal of attention recently due to their appearance in string theory. The Lagrangian mean curvature flow is a natural evolution process by which we can attempt to find special Lagrangian submanifolds, however once again the appearance of singularities is the basic difficulty. This research project aims to understand some common features of singularities which appear in families, in contrast with most previous research that focused on isolated singularities. Progress on this problem will have applications to many other related questions in geometry and analysis. The project also includes several educational activities aimed at increasing interest and success in STEM fields at all levels. Specifically, the educational activities include: a week long summer math circle aimed at students in grades three to five; support for undergraduate research; the continuation of a summer undergraduate workshop in geometry and topology; and the continuation of a bridge program for beginning graduate students to ease transitioning to graduate school.<br/><br/><br/>The most basic information that can be obtained from a singularity in many geometric problems is its tangent cone or tangent flow. The question of the uniqueness of such ""tangent objects"" is one of the most basic problems in geometric analysis and it is only well understood when singularities are isolated. The PI will study non-isolated singularities in two related settings: minimal hypersurfaces and the Lagrangian mean curvature flow. The tools developed for understanding the uniqueness of tangent cones and flows in these settings will also have applications to important geometric problems: the classification of minimal hypersurfaces with prescribed behavior at infinity; the generic smoothness of minimal hypersurfaces; and the possibility of surgeries at singularities along the Lagrangian mean curvature flow in connection with the Thomas-Yau conjecture. In addition to these specific applications, the PI expects that the new methods introduced in connection with the above problems will have applications in other areas of geometric analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such groups arise as groups of symmetries of various objects and are ubiquitous across many areas of mathematics, including algebraic geometry, number theory, and mathematical physics. In the arithmetic context, work done over the last six decades has resulted in a well-developed theory of linear algebraic groups over the rational numbers and other similar fields. While activity in this area is still ongoing, over the last ten years various problems in Lie group theory, arithmetic geometry, and other subjects have led to significant interest in the properties of algebraic groups over fields of geometric origin. Building on previous work, the research program will investigate the arithmetic, geometric, and structural aspects of algebraic groups over such higher-dimensional fields, with a particular focus on various finiteness properties. Mentoring graduate students and developing courses at the undergraduate and graduate levels will be an integral part of this work. In addition, a book project will be undertaken to open up recent developments in the emerging arithmetic theory of algebraic groups over higher-dimensional fields to a broader audience. <br/><br/>The project is a multi-faceted research program in the study of algebraic groups over higher-dimensional fields. The work will focus on the following three directions: the analysis of algebraic groups with good reduction and applications to local-global principles, the study of finiteness properties of unramified cohomology, and the investigation of rigidity phenomena for abstract homomorphisms of algebraic groups. A major goal in the study of groups with good reduction will be to make progress on a finiteness conjecture for forms of reductive algebraic groups over finitely generated fields having good reduction with respect to divisorial sets of discrete valuations. This work will significantly expand the scope of previous results, which dealt mainly with groups over fraction fields of Dedekind rings, and will also have important consequences for the properness of the global-to-local map in the Galois cohomology of algebraic groups. It turns out that, for certain types of groups, this finiteness conjecture is closely related to finiteness properties of unramified cohomology. As a result, one of the objectives will be to establish the expected finiteness of unramified cohomology in degree three for surfaces and certain higher-dimensional varieties over global fields. Concerning abstract homomorphisms, the goal will be to develop a substantial generalization of methods introduced in previous work to resolve a longstanding conjecture of Borel and Tits for all absolutely almost simple groups over infinite fields of relative rank at least two.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such large-scale monitoring networks currently use cellular and satellite networks to collect data. Due to the high infrastructure costs for solar panels and batteries, such networks are deployed only at limited locations and have delays ranging from a day up to a month. Real-time data collection will provide an understanding of the spatio-temporal dynamics of an environment. Such monitoring systems typically deploy sensors in large fields and require long battery life, long communication range to reduce infrastructure costs, share the medium with many more devices, and low cost. However, they have less stringent demands on communication speed and delay. Existing strategies for addressing long battery life and long-range communication do not co-exist efficiently in a large-scale network. Technologies that allow long-range communication typically drain the battery energy faster, while battery-efficient communication technologies are limited to short distances. In this work, novel communication algorithms, protocols, and architectures are proposed to simultaneously achieve long-range communication and long battery life in large-scale deployments.

Yet, research indicates that many students struggle to develop an understanding of graphical representations. We contend that students? understanding of coordinate systems, an understanding required to construct and interpret graphs, underlies their struggles to understand graphical representations and, moreover, lays the foundation necessary for developing that understanding. In this project, we examine middle-school students? understandings of coordinate systems and frames of reference prior to examining their graph construction and interpretation. This focus allows us to design instructional materials that can support students? graphing understandings in ways that avoid or mitigate how persistent challenges in students? graphing understandings identified in the research literature.<br/><br/>The overarching goals of this project are to advance knowledge of middle school students? developing understandings of graphs ?from the ground up? with attention to underlying coordinate systems and frames of reference that comprise the coordinate systems. Three research questions guide the project: (i) What are the ways of thinking through which individual students create and interpret frames of reference, coordinate systems, and graphs? (ii) In what general progressions do students develop these ways of thinking? (iii) What sequence of instructional tasks support and build on students? varied ways of thinking in their development of graphing understandings? The project addresses these questions by leveraging a design-based methodology in which we will engage in cycles of intervention and revision to develop, test, and refine cognitive models, constructive itineraries, and instructional tasks. Through several iterations of clinical interviews and small-scale teaching experiments, we intend to produce a theory that explains students? developing graphing understandings and accounts for their varied ways of thinking. Through this process, we will iteratively design instructional tasks and task sequences that support students developing understandings for frames of reference, coordinate systems, and graphs in the widely used and freely available Desmos platform.<br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

In addition, this award will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in research outside the customary manufacturing portfolio, with a desire to contribute to sustaining America's global leadership in advanced manufacturing and biomedicine.<br/><br/>This CAREER award supports fundamental science and engineering research in capillary-incorporated bioprinting for fabricating centimeter-sized scaffolds integrated with biomimetic porous microtubes that function as capillary vessels. The research tasks include (1) modeling the microtube morphology and permeability, (2) characterizing the effects of material and process parameters on the printing quality of the system, and (3) building the process-function relationship of biomimetic constructs. By successfully completing these three research tasks, this CAREER project will generate new knowledge about the mechanisms of porous microtube formation, the effect of wall thickness on the microtube permeability, and the interrelationships between material composition, process parameters, and the time-dependent properties of capillary-incorporated scaffolds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Accurate blood flow monitoring can reveal a critically important state of a patient's health, offering clinicians the information required for diagnosis and treatment. Unfortunately, current methods for detecting blood flow conditions are invasive with multiple procedures. In addition, the existing implantable system shows significant knowledge gaps in material integration and electronics manufacturing that can collectively serve as a design guideline for a complete system, considering sensitivity, compatibility, and wireless communication. This project aims to study and understand essential engineering fundamentals in mechanics, material integration, printing processes, and wireless methods for an implantable system. These mechanical, material, and electrical design principles will offer a broadly functional and adaptable foundation for a new class of implantable bioelectronics with distinct advantages of soft microstructures for enhanced contact to vessel walls, minimal disruption to hemodynamics, and enhanced wireless detection quality and distances. The findings resulting from this project will improve the understanding of blood flow dynamics to address the widespread and significant impact of vascular diseases. The engineering knowledge, including material preparation, fabrication, design, and sensing strategies, will be broadly applicable to improving implantable electronics and understanding many physiological processes. In addition, the interdisciplinary understandings and gains of various scientific knowledge and engineering materials will be used to educate abroad range of students in the field of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics.<br/><br/>Recently, various implantable devices have been developed specifically for vascular applications. However, these devices require the use of a bridging wire that is susceptible to fracture, while the readout distance is limited to less than a few centimeters. Despite this limitation, the standard procedure is to implant a biosensing system in the vascular system. In addition, since blood vessels are narrow and highly contoured, the required hemodynamic monitoring sensors must be compliant, soft, and miniaturized for seamless implantation and avoiding flow interference. To overcome the significant knowledge and technological gaps in the implantable systems, this project aims to study and understand essential engineering fundamentals in mechanics, material integration strategies, materials processing, and passive wireless electronics for an implantable biosensing system that seamlessly integrates with blood vessels for continuous hemodynamic monitoring. This project has the following research objectives, including 1) understanding of high-throughput printing of soft microstructures and integration for enhanced sensitivity of biosensors, 2) study of passive wireless sensing principles and 3D, multi-material integration for a high-performance wireless stent, and 3) study of a biosensing system deployment and fluid dynamics for long-term, multiplex wireless sensing. The fundamental principles revealed through this project will define a new guideline for emerging implantable systems subject to demanding requirements of low-profile form factor, sensitivity, implantability, and wireless performance. The engineering basics and biosensing system framework resulting from this project will advance the field of implantable bioelectronics to monitor and understand vascular and cardiac functionality, diagnostics, and therapeutics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Disperse flows arise in many problems of  practical interest in engineering and the natural environment.  Direct numerical simulations (DNS) have proven to be indispensable in understanding such flows.  However, for flows with more concentrated particles (i.e. low void fractions), it becomes computationally expensive to simulate interactions between particles. Even state-of-the-art simulations take much too long for them to become commonplace. This project will develop new computational methods, based on ideas from control theory, to speed up such simulations and use them to conduct an in-depth study of disperse multiphase systems with low void fractions. <br/><br/>The primary intellectual merit of the project lies in using computation algorithms that reduce communication among multiple processing elements for conducting large-scale simulations of heterogeneous multiphase systems - in particular, low void fraction disperse systems where the inclusion of many particles requires large computational domains and long computational times to collect converged statistical quantities. Such averaged data is critical for the construction of reduced order models used for industrial predictions. This project will aid in better understanding of multiphase flows and systems that are critical in energy conversion, material processing, the chemical industry, atmospheric processes, and living systems, as well as develop novel computational strategies based on event-triggered communications between processors to improve the efficiency of parallel computations. Further, people will be educated in both their development and use, and educational material aimed at lowering the barrier to entry for new researchers will be developed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to the tragic loss of human life, such events have a devastating effect on animals and plants. One challenge for biologists is to understand how species will respond to such climatic events ? if they can cope or if they will go extinct. To meet this challenge, researchers must identify what biological changes occur following extreme climatic events. This project seeks to understand how populations of tailed frogs, which are found in cold streams of the Pacific Northwest, have coped in the aftermath of a large fire and heatwave. The research team had been studying the physiology and  genetics of tailed frogs in this region for 4 years before the fire and heatwave occurred in 2020-2021. Only a year and a half after these events, the researchers will measure what physiological, genetic, and other changes have occurred in the frog populations. This will allow the researchers to 1) understand how the frog responded to extreme climatic events, 2) predict how they will respond in the future, and 3) present their findings to local land managers to discuss possible conservation strategies for frogs and other freshwater aquatic species in the area, and 4) train a postdoctoral and undergraduate researcher.               <br/><br/><br/>Species can respond to extreme climatic events via plasticity and/or adaptation. How populations respond may depend on the magnitude and severity of environmental change, although investigations of responses to extreme climatic events are rare. For four years, the researchers have been studying the thermal sensitivity and adaptive capacity of coastal tailed frogs (Ascaphus truei), a dominant herbivore in fast-flowing streams in the Pacific Northwest, to predict their responses to climate change. They have measured stream thermal characteristics, tadpole thermal physiology, and identified genomic markers associated with those variables. In 2020, an intense forest fire burned on top of two of the study streams. A year later, an unprecedented heatwave impacted all of the sites. The proposed research will test hypotheses about changes that have occurred at the environmental, physiological, and genomic levels in response to these climatic events. This research will (i) identify patterns of thermal physiological change in fire- and heatwave-affected populations, (ii) test for signatures of genetically-based adaptation to the fire and heatwave, and (iii) integrate physiological and genomic findings to predict the degree to which persistence of populations changes as a result of each extreme climatic event.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition to these internal processes, the ice sheet in western Antarctica is melting due to Earths warming climate and adding water to the ocean.  These changes in ice mass cause adjustments in rocks within the Earth's crust, allowing the surface to rebound in some locations and fall in others, altering the geographical pattern of sea-level change.  However, the solid Earth response depends strongly on the strength of the rocks at a wide range of timescales which is not well-known and varies with temperature and other rock properties.  This project has three primary goals.  (1) It will assess how processes such as rifting, mantle upwelling and lithospheric instability have altered the lithosphere and underlying asthenosphere of western Antarctica, contributing to a planet-wide understanding of these processes.  (2) It will use new measurements of mantle and crust properties to estimate the rate at which heat from the solid Earth flows into the base of the ice, which is important for modeling the rates at which the ice melts and flows.  (3) It will places bounds on mantle viscosity, which is key for modeling the interaction of the solid Earth with changing ice and water masses and their implications for sea-level rise.  To accomplish these goals, new resolution of crust and mantle structure will be obtained by analyzing seismic waves from distant earthquakes that have been recorded at numerous seismic stations in Antarctica.  These analyses will include new combinations of seismic wave data that provide complementary information about mantle temperature, heat flow and viscosity. This project will provide educational and career opportunities to a Brown University graduate student, undergraduates from groups underrepresented in science who will come to Brown University for a summer research program, and other undergraduates. The project will bring together faculty and students for a seminar at Brown that explores the connections between the solid Earth and ice processes in Antarctica.  Project research will be incorporated in outreach to local public elementary schools and high schools.<br/> <br/>This research addresses key questions about mantle processes and properties in western Antarctica.  What are the relative impacts of rifting, mantle plumes, and lithospheric delamination in the evolution of the lithosphere and asthenosphere?  Where is topography isostatically compensated, and where are dynamic processes such as plate flexure or tractions from 3-D mantle flow required? What are the bounds on heat flow and mantle viscosity, which represent important inputs to models of ice sheet evolution and its feedback from the solid Earth? To address these questions, this project will measure mantle and crust properties using seismic tools that have not yet been applied in Antarctica: regional-scale measurement of mantle attenuation from surface waves; Sp body wave phases to image mantle velocity gradients such as the lithosphere-asthenosphere boundary; and surface wave amplification and ellipticity.  The resulting models of seismic attenuation and velocity will be jointly interpreted to shed new light on temperature, bulk composition, volatile content, and partial melt, using a range of laboratory-derived constitutive laws, while considering data from mantle xenoliths. To test the relative roles of rifting, mantle plumes, and delamination, and to assess isostatic support for Antarctic topography, the predictions of these processes will be compared to the new models of crust and mantle properties.  To improve bounds on western Antarctic heat flow, seismic attenuation and velocity will be used in empirical comparisons and in direct modeling of vertical temperature gradients. To better measure mantle viscosity at the timescales of glacial isostatic adjustment, frequency-dependent viscosity will be estimated from the inferred mantle conditions. This project will contribute to the education and career development of the following: a Brown University Ph.D. student, Brown undergraduates, and undergraduates from outside the university will be involved through the Department of Earth, Environmental and Planetary Sciences (DEEPS) Leadership Alliance NSF Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) Site which focuses on geoscience summer research experiences for underrepresented students.

Such spaces are fundamental to many parts of mathematics, physics, engineering, and computer science, including both theoretical and applied areas.  The basic research in this project will bring new insights in the use of complex analysis to study moduli spaces of geometric structures.  The project's mathematical visualization elements will provide striking images and animations that can be used to illustrate the results of mathematical research to a broad audience.

This project will focus on foundational work on the complex-analytic side of this so-called ""higher Teichmueller theory"". Focusing specifically on the complex-analytic aspects allows the use of additional methods (e.g. pluripotential theory) and the incorporation of new ideas (e.g. opers), and is expected to enable more progress than would be possible when considering arbitrary semisimple groups.

The task of organizing large amounts of data in useful and ordered ways can be formulated in mathematical terms. This project investigates mathematical analogs of questions such as the following: How much data can we expect to organize in a useful way? What type of geometric structures arise in the process of such organization? Do these answers change if we allow ourselves to disregard a certain amount of information, and can the impact of such a choice be quantified? Finally, are there practical algorithms to implement such data organization? In geometric language, data naturally resides in a high dimensional space or a space where the notion of distance is quite different from the Euclidean one. This project aims at transferring well studied and efficient tools for analysis from low-dimensional Euclidean spaces to higher-dimensional and more general settings, allowing high-dimensional data to be ""visualized"" in a lower-dimensional, structured environment. The project will involve the training and mentoring of graduate students and postdocs and aims to develop tools which can lead to engagement between pure mathematicians and the data science community.<br/><br/>In many applications one is given a large data set, represented as a subset of a high-dimensional space, and one seeks to faithfully represent a large portion of this data set in a space of substantially lower dimension. ""Faithfully"" here means that essential geometric features are either preserved or mildly distorted. The Lipschitz condition for a geometric transformation quantifies the distortion of distances between data points. To date, the preceding task has received attention from computer scientists and applied mathematicians using a range of approaches. This project investigates mathematical approaches rooted in analysis and geometry. A key point is that often the given data has additional geometric structure, for example, it may have small Hausdorff dimension or be close to a union of low dimensional manifolds. Such added structure allows for the use of tools from harmonic analysis and geometric measure theory, especially, the theory of rectifiability. A quantitative version of this theory, known as uniform rectifiability, will be explored in novel metric settings. Other topics to be considered include quantitative improvements of low rank factorization theorems, Lipschitz decompositions of metric measure spaces, low-distortion factorization of bi-Lipschitz mappings, and Lipschitz parameterizations of high-dimensional spaces with parameterizing dimension greater than one.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemists have played a significant role in solving some of the world's greatest issues and improving the quality of life for all people. Often, this requires that chemists be trained with advanced skills and knowledge only achievable through the completion of a doctoral degree program (Ph.D.). Significant concerns have been raised both inside and out of the chemistry community related to the ability of American chemistry doctoral programs to prepare their students effectively for future careers and scientific endeavors. These shortcomings in doctoral training indicate that the current system is training chemists whose preparation to tackle the world's next grand challenges could be improved. As such, this project will investigate the training of doctoral chemistry students from the faculty perspective to complement existing research that describes student perspectives. The elements used to progress a student from beginning to end of the Ph.D. program are well-known and homogeneous. This project will unearth the specific rationale for how these elements are supposed to develop an independent scientist and identify the specific roles faculty advisors play. Additionally, funding for this project will be used to prompt significant reforms in the graduate programs in five chemistry departments. It is expected that all chemistry graduate programs will gain access to resources that guide potential reforms through this project. These reforms are expected to improve the quality of scientists produced by chemistry doctoral programs for the betterment of society.<br/><br/>Three objectives guide this project. The first will build a model that describes how the Ph.D. student develops into an independent scientist based on faculty advisors' stated goals and learning outcomes. Chemistry faculty will be interviewed to discover each core element's role(s) in a typical chemistry doctoral program. From thematic analyses, a model of doctoral education will be constructed and modified/validated by chemistry faculty. Activities in Objective 2 will discover the chemistry faculty's specific values and beliefs pertaining to the training of doctoral chemistry students. This important research will reveal the faculty advisors' goals, roles, and identities and how they affect the training chemistry doctoral students receive. These beliefs are expected to be heavily influential in the practices that are observed in doctoral education. Finally, Objective 3 will develop resources that outline the primary issues with current Ph.D. training and what reforms have been suggested to mitigate them. These resources will be distributed to all chemistry graduate programs across the country. Additionally, the PI will work closely with five specific chemistry departments with the explicit aim of achieving tangible reform in how each trains chemistry doctoral students. This attempt to engage in specific reform aims to produce a generation of chemists that are more prepared for the challenges they will face in their careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is a critical process by which students make sense of ideas ? particularly from source texts ? and bring them to bear to demonstrate their emerging understanding of concepts and to make sound arguments. Recognizing the importance of argumentative writing, multiple educational technologies driven by natural language processing (NLP) have been developed to support students and teachers in these processes. However, evidence is modest that such systems improve writing skills, and this is especially the case for younger students. One reason is that NLP technologies have only recently matured to the point that it is possible to provide feedback keyed to the content of students? writing. A second reason is that many students lack the strategic knowledge and skills needed to revise their essays even after receiving writing feedback. An educational technology that assesses students? skill at revising their writing and that provides feedback on their revision attempts would support the development of this critical skill, while placing no additional burden on teachers. Such a technology has the potential to prepare a new generation of students for productively writing and revising argumentative essays, a skill they will need in order to be prepared for the educational and workplace settings of the future.<br/><br/>To address the limitations of existing educational technologies for writing, the research team will develop a system that leverages NLP to provide students with formative feedback on the quality of their revisions. The team will 1) develop and establish the reliability and validity of new measures of revision quality in response to formative feedback on evidence use, 2) use NLP to automate the scoring of revisions using these measures, 3) provide formative feedback to students based on the automated revision scoring, and 4) evaluate the utility of this feedback in improving student writing and revision in classroom settings. The team hypothesizes that such a system will improve students? implementation of feedback messages on text-based argument writing, leading toward more successful revision and ultimately more successful writing. For learning researchers and educators, the revision quality measures will provide detailed information about how students implement formative feedback. Few summative or formative assessments currently exist that provide this type of information. For technology researchers, the automated revision scoring will extend prior writing analysis research in novel ways, e.g., by assessing the quality of revisions between essay drafts and by incorporating alignment with prior formative feedback into the assessment. Multiple types of NLP models will be developed to examine tradeoffs between model type and differing evaluation dimensions such as reliability, transparency, and fairness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project's novelties are in unique multidisciplinary approaches to (1) detect Asian-targeting disinformation and its countermeasure messages, and understand how they are spread on the web, (2) examine how the spread of disinformation and countermeasure messages on the web is associated with the intensity of the bias and hate crimes against Asian Americans, and (3) develop various data-driven computational models to help understanding the disinformation dynamics. The project's broader significance and importance are to inform civil society, including advocacy organizations and the general public, about how to strategize communication efforts in battling racial disinformation, and to make the developed tools and outcomes publicly available for broader uses.<br/><br/>The project takes three-staged approaches. The main objective of the first phase is to develop computational tools for the detection and analysis of the temporal dynamics between Asian-targeted disinformation and countermeasures on the Web. A specific focus is on developing automated identification tools and deep-learning classification models by feature-engineering unique characteristics of disinformation. The objective of the second phase is to understand to what extent the spread of disinformation and countermeasures online is associated with the societal trend of implicit bias and hate crime occurrences against Asian Americans in the real-world, which can be achieved via developing deep-learning causality models. The objective of the third phase is to design scalable data-driven deep-learning models of disinformation dynamics in macro and micro levels, identifying unknown dynamics from the real-world measurements, which also enables simulations of the learned dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Adversarial Thinking (AT) is widely recognized as a critically important ability for cybersecurity. The importance of AT has been widely discussed in the cybersecurity community, and many educators have created activities and exercises explicitly intended to strengthen AT in students to enhance their cybersecurity understanding and abilities. However, there is no broadly accepted description of AT or its components beyond describing it as the ability to ?think like an attacker."" As a result, there is no test to meaningfully quantify AT or the effectiveness of interventions designed to improve AT. To meet this important need, this foundation-building five-year project will create a description of the core components of AT. The project will use a consensus approach drawing on the knowledge and experience of a diverse group of individuals in the cybersecurity community. The project will create and validate a non-technical test for AT and use the test to 1) identify AT in individuals and 2) evaluate the effectiveness of exercises meant to improve AT. This project will shed light on fundamental knowledge about AT in cybersecurity, help identify the next generation of cybersecurity professionals, and give cybersecurity educators tools to improve the effectiveness of security education.<br/><br/>Based on the widespread belief that AT is critical for security, the hypotheses of this project are that 1) critical components of AT for cybersecurity can be identified, 2) a non-technical test can be created and validated that measures these components, 3) the test can be used to perform rigorous research about AT, and 4) this research can be integrated with and inform cybersecurity education. To test these hypotheses, the PI will work with a diverse set of cybersecurity experts in a modified Delphi process to identify and describe AT's most crucial elements and publish the results. The PI will then create, screen for bias, rigorously validate, and publish the Adversarial Thinking Assessment (ATA), an instrument to measure AT ability. The test will not require technical cybersecurity knowledge and hence can be administered broadly. Using the validated ATA, the PI will conduct experiments to identify AT ability across various groups of students and professionals. The PO will also develop and evaluate new interventions to help individuals develop AT skills. The overall project will drive an iterative, five-year AT-focused curriculum development for a sequence of two security courses at the University of Minnesota Duluth. The impact of this project is a new foundation for research around the critical concept of AT in the context of cybersecurity education. This CAREER award is supported in part by NSF's IUSE:EHR Program which supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. This project is also supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education. The SaTC program aligns with the Federal Cybersecurity Research and Development Strategic Plan and the National Privacy Research Strategy to protect and preserve the growing social and economic benefits of cyber systems while ensuring security and privacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This theory is also a natural mathematical framework in which physical systems as they evolve in time (called dynamical systems) can be represented and studied; groups are the algebraic structures that represent the time in this picture. Groups also model symmetries of physical systems and mathematical structures, and since their formal introduction in the 19th century, their applications have expanded deep into almost every major area of mathematics. Representation theory of groups provides canonical ways to assign operator algebras to a given group, hence establishes a bridge between the two theories which allows one to import ideas and concepts from one theory to the other. The study of the connections between groups and their associated operator algebras has been a central part of operator algebra theory since the time of von Neumann, and it has had tremendous impact on both theories, as well as in several other related areas such as ergodic theory, dynamical systems, and representation theory. This project aims to make further progress in this direction by discovering new connections between structural properties of groups and their operator algebras. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>The first part of the project is aimed at several conjectures and problems related to new operator-algebraic rigidity phenomena for discrete groups in terms of their C*-algebras. This is based on a new approach to extending important classical results from ergodic theory of higher rank groups to the operator-algebraic setting. The main concept of interest is that of invariant subalgebras of C*-algebras generated by unitary representations, which are viewed as non-commutative generalizations of normal subgroups. The boundary theory of groups (in the sense of Furstenberg) plays a central role in the Principal Investigator?s strategies to approach the proposed problems. Furstenberg's boundary theory has been, in the past few decades, a major tool in ergodic theory of higher rank lattices and in proving their rigidity properties. More recently, it has also been used in operator-algebraic rigidity problems, resulting in significant progress in this area. The project aims to develop new techniques in utilizing boundary actions in order to prove the proposed rigidity results for invariant subalgebras of C*-algebras generated by unitary representations of discrete groups. Another part of this project concerns several open problems regarding simplicity and unique trace property of C*-algebras of discrete quantum groups; the goal is to further develop the boundary theory of quantum groups and apply them in these problems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of particular interest are topics related to nonlinear optics, including the static (DC) and the optical (AC) Kerr effects, where the medium changes its index of refraction either under the influence of a strong external electric field or by self-modulation. The project will study nonlinear acoustics and nonlinear elasticity as well. One of the main goals is to understand the underlying models and the solutions well in the asymptotic high-frequency regime. The next goal is to solve the associated inverse problems: to determine the parameters of the medium from remote measurements. Ultrasound and elastography are known to work in the nonlinear regime, which is one of the motivations. In addition, the project will study the propagation of singular waves in case of a linear elastic-fluid interaction across an interface, and the associated inverse problem of recovery the parameters of the parameters of the medium, inspired by geophysical applications. The project will also study a question on the proper discretization of the geodesic X-ray transform and similar Radon transforms. The project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The investigator plans to analyze propagation of waves for the nonlinear wave fundamental phenomena: nonlinear optics, acoustics and elasticity. Such phenomena are described by quasilinear partial differential equations, for which the geometric optics theory is less than complete. The PI plans to exploit the specific nature of those models, combined with physics intuition. The PI plans to explain the DC and the AC Kerr effects for the nonlinear Maxwell equations, in particular, and to find the right asymptotic regimes under which they occur: the relationship between the wavelength and the intensity of the waves. Then the PI will study the associated inverse problems of recovery of the parameters of the medium from remote observations. The PI also plans to further study propagation of elastic and pressure waves in liquid-solid media: reflection, transmission and mode conversion across a smooth surface separating the two media. This is inspired by the model of Earth, where the Crust and the Mantle are solid, the Upper Core is believed to be liquid but the core is still solid. Finally, the PI plans to study sampling and proper discretization and inversion of the geodesic X-ray transform and similar Radon type of transforms. This is related to the recent work by the PI connecting sampling theory with semiclassical analysis, relating the sampling requirements to the semi-classical wave front set rather than looking into the ?band limit?

This project tackles these important questions to understand, using theory and methods from cultural anthropology, how migrants with very different personal circumstances and in different societal contexts make communities and integrate with surrounding populations. It supports under-represented scholars in STEM and trains graduate students.

In computer vision, capture of the real world is called reconstruction, and it is a core challenge that requires estimating the 3D shape, motion, object materials, and lighting within a scene. Successful reconstruction can provide spatial and geometric information of objects independent from lighting conditions to intelligent systems so that they can use the information for reasoning or creating applications of these objects from different viewing angles, e.g., in virtual and augmented reality. This project will scientifically investigate how to overcome the challenges of reconstruction by combining signals from different types of cameras in a way that is consistent with the physics of image formation. The project will integrate research and education by creating new interdisciplinary courses and promoting diversity from different outreach activities, e.g., supporting our K-12 AI4ALL local diversity effort, and attending inclusive teaching workshops at Brown?s Sheridan Center for Teaching and Learning.  <br/><br/>To help overcome the ill-posed problem of scene reconstruction from passive RGB cameras, this project has three areas of focus: 1) Investigate new camera systems that integrate multiple kinds of signals via physically based image formation models. Existing platforms handle typically one modality and frequency (visible light), but the project aims to combine visible light, time of flight, and event cameras to balance the negative effects of each camera and produce a signal of a quality that no individual camera could produce: high spatio-temporal resolution 3D video. 2) Investigate lighting and material decomposition via better capture, sampling, and reconstruction from heterogeneous omnidirectional cameras via new fast view synthesis methods adapted to represent incident illumination. This will use learned material priors from factorizations of physically based reflectance models that can exploit captured full and partial omnidirectional samples. 3) Investigate hybrid representations, optimization, and machine learning methods, including initialization based on reliable sparse sampling from depth sensors, via physically based self-supervised transforms to constrain optimization, and via residual error channels to allow the model to explain all that it can in a physically meaningful way and still train on real-world data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Interestingly, dynamic transition from helices to sheets in fibrous proteins facilitates a remarkable increase in the strength, stiffness, and energy dissipation capacity. The fact that advanced and diverse material performance can be achieved by remarkably simple structural blocks and their transformations has inspired researchers to develop new polymeric materials based on the same concept. Polyamino acids (PAAs), also known as synthetic polypeptides, can adopt analogous structures. However, inducing the structural transitions in the solid PAA of high molecular weights (MWs) is a largely unmet challenge. As a result, many of the PAA materials either have poor thermomechanical properties or are incompatible with polymer processing techniques such as extrusion and compression molding. This project aims to develop a general strategy to significantly improve the thermomechanical properties and processability of synthetic PAAs by taking advantage of metastable, transformable structures of PAAs and control over their in-situ transition and hierarchical organization. Successful completion of the research will break the constraint of solution process and prepare new PAA materials in the melt for large-scale production of films/bars/fibers with morphological and properties control, using standard polymer processing techniques. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained on bioinspired polymeric materials and acquire skills in polymer synthesis, material characterization, mechanics, and computer simulations. The program will integrate the research into the new and existing course, promote interdisciplinary education and high-quality research experiences, and demonstrate the application of materials research through lectures and workshops for the public.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>Prepared by ring-opening polymerization of amino acid N-carboxyanhydride monomers, high-MW PAAs are polypeptide model systems that form stable alpha-helix or beta-sheet structures. With the recent development of living cooperative polymerization and other strategies, PAAs with complex architectures and controlled molecular structures have been synthesized on large scales at high yield and purity. Still, structural biological materials made from fibrous proteins have far more advanced material performance, and they have more diverse mechanical behaviors than their organic counterparts. Equipped by a new knowledge on how to synthesize PAA copolymers capable of transforming from alpha-helices to beta-sheets, the planned research seeks advancements in the mechanical properties and processability of solid PAA materials. Control over ordered secondary structures of PAAs, their in-situ transformation and hierarchical organization in the solid state are central to this study. Carefully designed PAA copolymers containing transformable secondary structures will be utilized to make hard thermoset materials, semi-hard strain-stiffening materials, and materials that are soft at low stress but have high tensile strength and extensibility. The findings from this project may enable the generation of polymeric systems that will approach the level of sophistication and versatility found in some of nature?s biomaterials. The research also provides a model system of synthetic polymers with intrinsic secondary structures in which the different partitioning of intramolecular and intermolecular networks determines the macroscopic properties of materials, enabling comparison of the experimental results with predictions from simulations and modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A prominent paradigm to address racial bias has been to create opportunities for people of different races to have contact with each other. Interracial contact can be an efficient intervention, but it is unlikely to work as intended without a firm understanding of the exact conditions that reduce racial bias. How deep must contact be? Is it sufficient for people in one group to merely see those of other groups, without any effort to recognize each person (i.e., mere exposure)? Is it necessary to see individuals frequently enough to recognize them without knowing anything else about them (i.e., perceptual individuation)? Or is it essential to interact with someone enough to acquire personal information about them (i.e., knowledge-based individuation)? This project provides a rigorous analysis of these three forms of interracial contact to test whether the extent of contact ? while holding constant positivity of contact ? can influence peoples' perceptions and evaluations of others, which can have downstream consequences for reducing racial prejudice.<br/> <br/>The primary aim of this project is to examine how different forms of contact shape racial bias on visual perception of faces, spontaneous judgments, evaluations, and beliefs. Study 1 tests how naturally occurring experiences of interracial contact over a lifetime account for the categorization and evaluation of racial information and for beliefs about other racial groups. Study 2 examines the same categorizations, evaluations, and beliefs, while experimentally manipulating the type of exposure to others. Study 3 utilizes pupillometry and eye-tracking methods to indicate the salience of others' faces after having different forms of contact. Together these studies stand to transform our understanding of whether, how, and why interracial contact could be an effective way to reduce racial prejudice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project examines how differences in Critical-Zone processes influence topography through a comparative experiment of two different bedrock units on the tropical island of Puerto Rico. On the island, ancient volcanic rocks form steep, high peaks and have clay-rich soils, whereas granitic rocks underlie relatively more subdued, rolling hills covered by sandier soils. This study will evaluate the impact of these differences on the occurrence of landslides, the size of sediment grains that populate river channels, and the size and frequency of floods. The principal hypothesis is that landslides cut more deeply in the clay-rich soils and, as a result, deliver coarser sediment to rivers. The coarser sediment, in turn, better shields the river channel from erosion such that larger floods are needed to carve the underlying bedrock. In addition, the clay-rich volcanic soils retain more rainwater, resulting in fewer floods than areas covered by sandy granitic soils. The net result is that the volcanic rocks maintain a higher elevation and steeper topography than the granitic terrain. This project will test these ideas through detailed landslide mapping, grain-size measurements, statistical analyses of streamflow gaging data, and measurements of long-term landscape erosion rates. This project will form the basis for graduate and undergraduate research experiences and also engage additional students at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagez and Colorado State University in an experiential learning, research, and cultural exchange program centered on comparing and contrasting the landscapes in Puerto Rico and Colorado.<br/><br/>Variations in topographic relief, steepness, and height are often observed to correlate with differences in bedrock geology. Most often, these changes are interpreted to result from differences in the erodibility of the underlying bedrock. On the tropical island of Puerto Rico intermediate-to-mafic volcaniclastic units underlie high relief, steep mountains, whereas felsic-rich granitic-to-granodioritic rocks are characterized by gentler, rolling hills. Preliminary results indicate that unweathered bedrock strength and fracture density between these two rock units is similar, implying the differences in primary rock strength or erodibility cannot explain the stark contrast in topography. Previous studies show that the soils developed atop each of these rock units are distinct, with the more mafic units comprised of clay-rich soils and sandier soils developed in the more felsic units. These differences in soil characteristics and associated Critical Zone architecture promote relief production in the volcaniclastic units relative to the granitic units. Specifically, differences in the Critical Zone affect the magnitude of incision thresholds by controlling bedload grain size distributions and the frequency of floods that breach these thresholds by modulating shallow, subsurface hydrology. These hypotheses will be tested by mapping landslide locations, measuring grain size distributions in sediment deposits, analyzing flood statistics from existing stream gaging stations, and calculating long-term erosion rates from cosmogenic radionuclides. Datasets will be synthesized into a modeling framework that predicts fluvial landscape relief as a function of rock strength, the magnitude of incision thresholds, and the frequency of threshold breaching floods.

Stable conditions persist for days as a long-lived weather regime in polar regions. A better understanding of atmospheric flows under stable conditions is key for advances in areas such as mass balance of polar ice sheets, climate modeling, orographic precipitation, fog formation, severe downslope windstorms, and associated aircraft turbulence. Despite numerous theoretical, computational, and experimental investigations of stable conditions in the atmosphere, its accurate representation in numerical weather prediction (NWP) models remains to be a challenging task. Over or under estimation of turbulent mixing is known to create unintended consequences in other aspects of meteorological modeling, such as incorrect predictions of stronger winds and precipitation. This project aims to better comprehend turbulence in long-lived, stable conditions and develop a reliable theory for its mathematical representation in computer models, which is expected to pave the way to more accurate weather forecasts and climate projections with reduced uncertainties.    <br/><br/>The scientific objectives of the project will be achieved through intensive direct numerical simulations of turbulence in the Ekman layer under the joint action of a surface cooling flux and a constant ambient stratification. The configuration is an idealization of long-lived atmospheric boundary layers observed in polar regions and differs from the common approach of simulating stable Ekman layers with surface cooling only. The project will quantify the effects of an expanded dimensionless parameter space on turbulence. The project will extend and refine similarity theories and correlations for long-lived stable Ekman layers. A quantitative classification scheme to account for the global intermittency of turbulence in stable boundary layers is expected at projection completion. This project will contribute an atmospheric boundary layer module to an existing open source spectral/hp element flow solver and provide research experiences in computational sciences and high-performance computing to undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These are complicated decisions that impact homeowners and communities for many years. Such decisions are influenced by many factors, including household income, access to insurance, location of employment, the need for local services such as medical care or schools, and connections to family and friends. One underlying factor that affects all these others is place attachment, or the emotional and functional ties that people have to the place where they live. This study focuses on understanding how place attachment influences the decisions people make after disasters, specifically decisions about where they live and whether they invest in measures that reduce their risk to future disasters. Focused on three California counties that have been affected by recent, major wildfires, findings from this study will help local governments and practitioners develop programs that better support households that are affected by disasters and inform community planning for hazards associated with climate change.<br/><br/>This study investigates the role of place attachment in residential adjustment after wildfires. Households affected by wildfires face a critical decision point: do they rebuild in the same way, rebuild with new mitigation efforts, or relocate? Relatively few studies have examined the factors that influence these residential decision-making processes, particularly the role of intangible factors like place attachment. This study addresses these critical gaps in our understanding, with the goals of: (1) investigating residential adjustment among homeowners affected by recent California wildfires, (2) examining the role of place attachment in post-disaster residential adjustment, and (3) assessing the extent to which current place attachment measures capture the observed dynamics of place attachment in disaster contexts. Using three California counties as study sites, and building on a pilot study in these same, fire-affected communities, the research team will use photovoice method and phenomenological analyses to develop a deep, contextually grounded understanding of the role of place attachment in residential decisions. Additionally, the team will use qualitative comparative analysis to examine commonalities in household adjustment pathways after disaster. Study findings will advance both the theoretical and practical understanding of place attachment in mitigation and recovery. Given that place attachment is a foundational construct tied to many other aspects of recovery decision-making, this will be a critical contribution for US communities given the increasing losses to wildfire and other climate-induced disasters. Furthermore, study findings will contribute meaningfully to housing recovery policy, adaptation policy, and recovery and relocation practice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Properties and life-time performance of materials used in these coatings are often dictated by the crystallinity of the materials. Traditionally, improving and/or controlling the crystallinity in coatings require processing at high-temperatures, use of energetic beams, and/or extended annealing for long durations. Atomically-thin sheets of materials such as graphite and hexagonal boron nitride (hBN, also known as white graphite), referred to as van der Waals (vdW) layers, can aid the synthesis of materials with better crystallinity. The goal of this project is to understand the mechanisms leading to enhancing crystallinity on vdW layers. One doctoral student is trained through this project and the research results are taught to undergraduate students in engineering and disseminated through conference presentations and technical publications. By organizing focused workshops at technical conferences, the principal investigator intends to promote awareness of (and find viable solutions to) the challenges faced by graduate students with families.<br/><br/>Technical description:<br/>The aim of this project is to develop an atomic-scale understanding of the factors controlling the growth of thin solid films on vdW surfaces. Preliminary results obtained by the team suggest that thin films sputter-deposited on hBN layers exhibit better crystallinity than homoepitaxially grown thin films. To understand this intriguing result, it is hypothesized that adatom mobility on vdW surfaces is higher than that on conventional 3D solids and that there exist well-defined crystallographic orientation relations between the substrate, vdW layer, and the deposit. The project uses in situ variable-temperature scanning tunneling microscopy experiments to validate this hypothesis and to test the generality of these observations. Through time-resolved measurements of the thin film growth, the role of the vdW-layer on surface diffusivities and morphological evolution kinetics are quantitatively determined. This project is providing new insights into a potentially technologically important venue for synthesizing high-quality crystalline thin films for a variety of applications. This approach may be the most effective way to improve crystallinity of highly refractory compounds and thermally unstable materials for which increasing temperature has little or deleterious effect on the microstructure and composition of the material.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, pyridinium salts serve as valuable precursors to subunits that commonly occur in active pharmaceutical ingredients. The funded project will focus on the development of new methods to generate pyridinium salts using environmentally benign processes, including the use of non-toxic iodine-based oxidants and electrochemical methods. The chosen approaches will allow for access to a more diverse range of pyridinium salts than was previously possible, facilitating the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, and their study will also help to advance emerging technologies for chemical synthesis. The broader impacts of the award will extend to enabling Professor Wengryniuk to continue her significant efforts to advance the mentorship and promotion of women in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). Specifically, under the auspices of the previously established Outstanding Women Leaders in Science (OWLS) initiative, the PI will develop a female mentor/female mentee match program and establish an annual Women in Chemistry seminar series at Temple University to provide scientific and professional mentorship opportunities for female students.<br/><br/>The synthesis of N-alkyl and N-aryl pyridinium salts will be investigated by two strategies that offer unrivalled versatility as compared to earlier approaches by virtue of their reactivity umpolung.

Notably, the walking droplet system bears a strong resemblance to the quantum pilot-wave theory researched in the 1920s by Louis de Broglie, who envisaged microscopic particles as oscillators that generate a propulsive pilot-wave field. Remarkably, the walking droplets exhibit many features previously thought to be exclusive to the microscopic, quantum realm. Thus, they have provided the basis for the burgeoning field of hydrodynamic quantum analogs, the goal of which is to demarcate clearly the line between those features of quantum mechanics that can and cannot be understood from a classical perspective. The approach is progressive: the establishment of each new hydrodynamic quantum analog moves this line. Specifically, the walking-droplet system has suggested classical reinterpretations of a number of the most beguiling quantum notions, including wave-particle duality, wave function collapse, superposition of states, orbital quantization, single-particle diffraction and interference, uncertainty and nonlocality. The award supports the PI's integrated experimental and theoretical investigation of hydrodynamic quantum analogs, as will naturally inform the viability of classical pilot-wave dynamics as the basis for a realist quantum theory. The intellectual merit of this research is that it will thus both question and inform the philosophical foundations of modern physics.<br/><br/><br/>The award supports the PI's investigations of hydrodynamic quantum analogs, that include the discovery of new analog systems in the laboratory, the theoretical modeling thereof, and critical comparison with the quantum analog of interest.

Theoretical developments will be directed towards advancing and exploring a generalized classical pilot-wave framework that captures the key common features of the walking-droplet system and de Broglie?s pilot-wave theory. In addition to providing a platform for exploring a remarkably rich new dynamical system, this classical theoretical framework might ultimately provide a mathematical bridge between models of wave-particle interactions on the macroscopic and microscopic scales. Both experimental and theoretical components of the research will give particular attention to elucidating the manner in which apparently non-local features may arise through local, pilot-wave interactions, with focus on the possibility of achieving non-separable states and entanglement with classical pilot-wave dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The analysis of how conversations unfold, and which communication patterns matter most, had been underdeveloped. However, research funded by the National Science Foundation developed the Dynamic Dyadic Systems approach, which provides analytic tools for studying interpersonal conversations and linking patterns of interaction to interpersonal outcomes.

Projects from the first conference provide the basis for publications showcasing how the Dynamic Dyadic Systems approach can propel new discoveries about conversations. The products of the first conference, including data sets, tutorials, and reports, provide the materials for a second conference in which the novel techniques are demonstrated and shared with a broader audience of scholars.

However, starting with quantum mechanics, a great number of models emerged that led to important mathematical problems involving variables that no longer commute. Noncommutative Algebra is one of the major areas of mathematics that studies those structures. This project addresses key problems about the properties and symmetries of noncommutative objects, as well as the representations of the corresponding noncommutative algebras. The latter area of representations theory investigates noncommutative algebras through all possible ways to present them in terms of matrices. Three major approaches are used: (1) Poisson geometry--geometry arising from the deformation of commutative objects to noncommutative ones, (2) cluster algebras--a combinatorial approach based on intricate internal transformations of the objects, called cluster mutations and (3) monoidal triangulated categories--general abstract algebraic structures arising from considering all representations of an algebra simultaneously. These research activities will be used as the foundation for the training of graduate and undergraduate students and for mentoring of mathematics postdocs. <br/> <br/>In more detail, in this project the PI will investigate the structure of quantum symmetric spaces, Nichols algebras, monoidal triangulated categories, as well as support theories for finite dimensional algebras and, more generally, finite tensor categories. The following three broad directions will be pursued: (1) Root of unity quantum cluster algebras will be investigated in two interrelated plans: description of their discriminant ideals and classification of irreducible representations. This will be based on the theory of Poisson orders and Cayley-Hamilton algebras. (2) Quantum cluster algebra structures will be constructed on quantum flag varieties, quantum Bott-Samelson varieties and quantum symmetric spaces. The irreducible representations and discriminant ideals of their root of unity quantum counterparts will be studied through the techniques developed in part 1. The representation theory of quantum symmetric pairs and quantum supergroups at roots of unity will be developed using star products and Poisson orders. (3) Methods for the classification of the noncommutative Balmer spectra of the stable categories of finite tensor categories will be developed.

In practice, the number of particles, and therefore the complexity of the system, ranges beyond the capabilities of the best computing resources. This project aims to achieve a substantial reduction in computational complexity through a statistical point of view, focused on the probability of finding at a given time a particle in the system at a certain position in space and moving with a certain velocity. The results are expected to be directly applicable to the modeling of states of matter such as Bose-Einstein condensates or plasmas, and of systems with particle-like behavior, as vortices in fluids or superconductors.

The investigator aims to determine the minimal regularity assumptions on the limiting equation needed for quantitative convergence, whether convergence is valid in the more realistic setting of noise in the dynamics, the optimal time scales for the mean-field approximation to hold, and the sharp rate of convergence. The second part deals with the supercritical mean-field scaling regime, a singular limit of Newton?s second law or the semiclassical Schrdinger equation leading to a kinetic generalization of Euler?s equation for an ideal fluid. The goal is to identify the optimal range for the validity of this limit through analytical and numerical means by building on progress for the monokinetic case where the limiting equation reduces to the incompressible Euler equation and drawing on a connection to the quasineutral limit in plasma physics. An important quantity for measuring convergence is a modulated energy-entropy or free energy, which is related to renormalized energies appearing in the statistical mechanics of Coulomb and Riesz gasses.

The proposed ArMs incorporate synthetic catalysts that use visible light to effect a broad range of challenging chemical reactions, into protein scaffolds that will enable spatial control over the course of these reactions. As such, the designed ArM constructs will provide a unique platform to control the selectivity of reactions that are useful for chemical synthesis and potentially applicable for the manufacture of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and other advanced materials. The broader impacts of the funded project will extend to an integrated outreach program focused on improving understanding of the important topic of biocatalysis among graduate, undergraduate, and high school students via innovative educational content modules. To complement this activity, a high school teacher professional development program will be developed that likewise explores the theme of biocatalysis.<br/><br/>Understanding how enzymes can serve as hosts for different catalytic reactions and how second sphere interactions and conformational dynamics influence the properties and reactivity of metal cofactors, would greatly improve our ability to use proteins as supramolecular hosts for catalysis. Furthermore, the insights gained from such endeavors will shed light on design principles for implementing second sphere interactions more broadly in catalysis. Previous studies in the Lewis group led to the development of ArMs based on a prolyl oligopeptidase (POP) scaffold and robust methods to evolve these ArMs were identified. The work revealed that attractive interactions and conformational dynamics impact cofactor binding/bioconjugation, catalytic selectivity, and photophysical properties of metal complexes linked to POP. The funded project takes these ideas further and it will focus on the development of a new class of POP-based metal polypyridine ArMs while entailing efforts to: (a) understand metal polypyridine binding and photophysical properties within POP, (b) evolve covalent metal polypyridine ArMs for selective photoredox and energy transfer catalysis, and (c) engineer non-covalent ArMs to control the selectivity of commercially available photocatalysts. The planned research aims to illuminate on how non-covalent interactions in a conformationally dynamic protein scaffold can modulate cofactor reactivity. This approach will complement efforts in bioinorganic chemistry to model metallocofactors with static synthetic cofactor analogues or the effects of static protein scaffolds on metal ion reactivity. The potential to control the selectivity of a broad range of photoredox properties using the proposed ArMs also has the potential to significantly impact synthetic methodology.

Through the design and synthetic control of the chemical structures of polymers, polymer properties can be tailored for use in a wide range of applications.

Recent research has revealed that the process of microbes taking up residence inside the cells of other species (known as endosymbiosis) is very common, especially among insects. For example, a single microbe called Wolbachia infects more than half of all insect species on Earth. Unlike mitochondria, Wolbachia are usually not required for their hosts to survive and reproduce. Instead, the proportion of individuals within a host species with Wolbachia at any time varies greatly for unknown reasons, making it hard to predict the consequences for host biology. This project will unravel the causes of variable Wolbachia prevalence as a model for more broadly understanding conditions that favor endosymbiosis. This work will also potentially contribute to improving human health. Wolbachia can block viruses like dengue and Zika in mosquito systems, but increasing the efficacy of this work requires identifying conditions that favor high Wolbachia prevalence. This project will identify such conditions in natural systems. Locally, this project will educate and train first-generation and Native Montana students in cutting-edge laboratory, field, and computational approaches that will improve their competitiveness in STEM-related careers. A new course at the University of Montana focused on host-microbe interactions will be further developed to include outreach activities aimed at exposing individuals in rural Montana to the unique biology of endosymbiosis.<br/> <br/>Organismal performance and fitness depends on interactions across levels of biological organization. Among all species interactions, those between animals and microbial endosymbionts that live inside their cells are perhaps the most intimate, influencing host behavior, physiology, life history, and fitness. Some endosymbionts may even contribute to reproductive isolation and speciation, highlighting their broad importance for host biology. The evolutionary outcomes of host-endosymbiont interactions ultimately depend on endosymbiont prevalence in host populations, which varies widely for unknown reasons. This project will leverage 50 million years of Wolbachia evolution distributed across divergent host species to determine the causes of Wolbachia frequency variation. The project will specifically dissect how genes in host and endosymbiont genomes interact with each other and with temperature (GxGxE interactions) to influence maternal Wolbachia transmission rates and the strength of Wolbachia-induced reproductive manipulations like cytoplasmic incompatibility. Mathematical models will then be used to evaluate how both genomic and environmental interactions contribute to Wolbachia prevalence in divergent host systems. At each step, this project includes activities that will leverage the unique biology of endosymbiosis to educate and train first-generation and Native students in Montana.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mathematical theory of singular integrals has traditionally been formulated in smooth geometric settings. However, demand for an understanding of singular integrals in rougher settings has grown recently with a more refined understanding of mathematical models for physical phenomena in irregular or non-smooth environments. Emerging applications of singular integrals in quantum computing further buttress the need for such extensions of the classical theory. Notably, the relationship between singular integrals and the geometry of sets and measures facilitates a new understanding of dimension reduction for high-dimensional point sets, that is, mechanisms to detect whether large collections of points in a high-dimensional space in fact lie on a smooth lower-dimensional manifold. Results of this nature are important for data science applications, and the project has the potential to bring the toolkit of singular integral theory to bear on this important application domain. By coupling pure harmonic analysis methods with tools from combinatorics and probability, and through its noticeable interface with questions of relevance in data science, the project will also provide opportunities for the training of junior mathematicians, including graduate students.<br/><br/>This project considers a variety of questions in the study of singular integrals in non-smooth or rough settings, using both existing and newly developed tools. The principal investigators have been at the forefront of the past development of such a theory, and the current project will crystallize new applications to other areas of geometry and analysis. Questions under consideration in this project include: (a) a sharp characterization of bounded singular integrals with matrix weight, which is important in the regularity theory of vector stationary stochastic processes, (b) a characterization of weighted boundedness for para-product singular operators on graphs with cycles (multi-trees, Hamming cubes, etc.), and (c) the David-Semmes regularity problem in codimensions larger than one.

As a result of the strong attraction between the positive and negative charges, most ionic compounds (like table salt) are solids at room temperature.  This is not always the case, however.  In some cases, the positive and negative ions can exist as a liquid at room temperature, despite the strong forces. These ionic liquids have unique properties that can be harnessed for a variety of applications. Unfortunately, there are only a few examples, which makes it difficult to adjust their properties for specific needs.  In solvate ionic liquids (SILs), solvent-like molecules are stuck to the positive ions, resulting in a novel mixture that has ionic liquid-like properties, but which can be chemically tuned. Professors Kuroda, Kumar and Jorn are combining computer simulation with experimental measurement to determine how the molecular packing of the ions in the liquid influences their properties. Their discoveries could have impact on many technologies, including next generation batteries needed for clean energy storage. The project is also providing research opportunities for students who will become the next generation of scientists and engineers. In addition, this work impacts the general community through a simple educational outreach project entitled ""The Po?boy Battery"" (named after the famous Louisiana sandwich), in which middle and high school students build a functional battery from common household materials.<br/><br/>The research team is advancing the field of solvate ionic liquids via the development of an integrated computational - experimental formalism spanning multiple length scales. The synergy connects the nanoscale molecular environments of candidate SILs to emergent behavior at the mesoscale and their stability at metal surfaces. These connections are achieved by combining molecular based experiments (such as conventional and time resolved infrared spectroscopy) with atomistic simulations, electrochemical experiments, and coarse-grained modeling. The framework developed in this proposal is elucidating a greater understanding of solvate ionic liquids, thereby directly impacting rapidly growing areas such as the development of new solvents for organic synthesis and next-generation energy storage electrolytes.

Yet, research indicates that many students struggle to develop an understanding of graphical representations. We contend that students? understanding of coordinate systems, an understanding required to construct and interpret graphs, underlies their struggles to understand graphical representations and, moreover, lays the foundation necessary for developing that understanding. In this project, we examine middle-school students? understandings of coordinate systems and frames of reference prior to examining their graph construction and interpretation. This focus allows us to design instructional materials that can support students? graphing understandings in ways that avoid or mitigate how persistent challenges in students? graphing understandings identified in the research literature.<br/><br/>The overarching goals of this project are to advance knowledge of middle school students? developing understandings of graphs ?from the ground up? with attention to underlying coordinate systems and frames of reference that comprise the coordinate systems. Three research questions guide the project: (i) What are the ways of thinking through which individual students create and interpret frames of reference, coordinate systems, and graphs? (ii) In what general progressions do students develop these ways of thinking? (iii) What sequence of instructional tasks support and build on students? varied ways of thinking in their development of graphing understandings? The project addresses these questions by leveraging a design-based methodology in which we will engage in cycles of intervention and revision to develop, test, and refine cognitive models, constructive itineraries, and instructional tasks. Through several iterations of clinical interviews and small-scale teaching experiments, we intend to produce a theory that explains students? developing graphing understandings and accounts for their varied ways of thinking. Through this process, we will iteratively design instructional tasks and task sequences that support students developing understandings for frames of reference, coordinate systems, and graphs in the widely used and freely available Desmos platform. <br/><br/>The Discovery Research preK-12 program (DRK-12) seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools.

Despite these characteristics, that often buffer against decimation, the sunflower sea star (Pycnopodia helianthoides) suffered major declines between 2013 and 2020 due to a disease outbreak and warming events, which led to listing by the IUCN as Critically Endangered. The sunflower star helps maintain ecological balance in kelp forest ecosystems; its absence across large swaths of its range has led to concerns for the future of the ecosystem. This loss has highlighted the need to better understand dispersal and recovery dynamics in this ecologically important species in a time when global change stressors are intensifying. The widespread loss of Pycnopodia ? combined with recent sightings of new juveniles in the range where it?s been lost ? created an opportunity to answer questions about the genetic relatedness among new colonists, source populations of colonists, patterns of gene expression, and associations with environmental factors, and their implications for the future of the species. The investigators are collaborating with a diverse team of partners already surveying the coast, to collect genetic information from new colonists. The research proposed here has direct and consequential impacts on conservation actions for Pycnopodia through ongoing collaborations with the Nature Conservancy and fills an important gap for future conservation decisions aimed at restoring this important member of the kelp forest ecosystem to its historical range. As more species come under threat from rapidly intensifying global change, understanding recovery dynamics is an important and necessary step in instigating conservation actions.  The investigator is developing a teaching lesson for a nearby community college and an undergraduate student will be trained.<br/><br/>Massive demographic declines associated with anthropogenically-induced stressors have increased in recent years, raising questions about species? ability to recover. The ecologically important sunflower sea star (Pycnopodia helianthoides) has suffered a precipitous (88?100%) decline since 2013 due to sea star wasting (SSW) disease and warming. The widespread loss of Pycnopodia provides a backdrop against which recent sightings of new juveniles in the extirpated range offer an opportunity to examine the contributions of four processes ? (1) sweepstakes reproductive success, (2) cohesive dispersal, (3) larval cloning, and (4) allele surfing ? to the evolutionary trajectory of populations following mass mortality. Additionally, identifying propagules? source populations, evaluating gene expression profiles, and analyzing genotype?environment associations of colonists can help elucidate potential colonization pathways that favor recovery or signal ongoing threats. The investigators are soliciting new opportunistic collections of Pycnopodia from many partners and are responding to any observation in California and Oregon to acquire the samples and generate the whole genome resequencing data needed to test hypotheses segregating the aforementioned processes. As more species come under threat from rapidly intensifying global change, understanding recovery dynamics is critical to understanding population dynamics in the marine benthic environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Beliefs in causal explanations (for example, investing in new technologies will cause your available money for retirement to increase) guide which behaviors to engage in for the future (e.g., invest in crypto-currency). But people can ? and often do ? believe causal explanations of the world that are wrong. Understanding what in the nature of an incorrect causal explanation makes it believable is critically important for teaching people to reject incorrect explanations of events. In this work, the PIs investigate what makes incorrect causal explanations of events appealing to people and what encourages the adoption of these misplaced beliefs. Holding incorrect causal explanations can have critically damaging effects, such as people pursuing health treatments that are ineffective or investing in financial strategies that do not pay out. It is therefore important to better understand what makes incorrect causal explanations appealing so strategies can be deployed to counteract their adoption. In the work, the PIs conduct a series of studies to provide a strong understanding of what in the nature of a causal explanation makes it appealing. Across studies, the PIs explore many different causal elements of explanations. Using their results, the PIs then make a preliminary attempt to reduce endorsement of incorrect causal explanations. This research has a broader impact on science by involving students in research that has a strong translational component. Such research helps students connect science to the real-world, growing their interest in science and critical thinking at large. Additionally, the proposed work will have broader impacts on science literacy by isolating what in scientific explanations may make them more or less likely to be believed. <br/><br/>The PIs use psychological methods from the causal explanation literature to study perceptions of a wide range of misplaced and incorrect causal explanations. These methods include having people read explanations and rate how compelling, satisfying, and believable the explanations are. In addition, participants in these studies make judgments about the causal structure of the explanations, such as how many causal factors the explanations include, how complex the explanations are, and how many events the explanations can explain. The PIs use large samples of online participants to ensure that people with many different beliefs are being included in the studies. In each study, the PIs have participants rate incorrect causal explanations (e.g., ?eating sugar is the main cause of type 2 diabetes?) as well as fact-based causal explanations of the same events (e.g., ?type 2 diabetes has multiple causes, including being overweight and having a genetic predisposition?). This comparison allows for isolation of what is unique about misplaced explanations. Using machine learning, the researchers investigate the degree to which there are characteristic structures of factual and misinformation explanations, beyond how they are perceived (e.g., the complexity of causal structure), which may allow for more automatic differentiation between these explanation types. Finally, the PIs use their findings to create a set of behavioral studies where they alter how explanations are presented to explore the degree to which presentation impacts endorsement of the explanations. Specifically, the PIs create new causal explanations that manipulate the causal elements that were most predictive of endorsement for incorrect causal beliefs in earlier experiments (e.g., complexity, number of causal factors). The goal is to see if by changing these important causal elements, endorsement of incorrect beliefs can be reduced. Through these studies we can learn more generally how to prevent the uptake of incorrect information in favor of fact-based explanations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Models with this type of motions can be widely found in physics, biology, chemistry, as well as in engineering and economics. Hyperbolicity theory, which is an important part of general theory of dynamical systems, provides a mathematical foundation for the deterministic chaos phenomenon by supplying researchers with tools that allow them to describe global properties of a nonlinear dynamical system using information about infinitesimal hyperbolic behavior of its trajectories. The study of hyperbolic phenomena originated in the seminal works of Artin, Morse, Hedlund and Hopf, but the systematic study of hyperbolic dynamical systems was initiated by Smale, Anosov and Sinai, who studied dynamical systems with strong hyperbolic behavior which possess high level of unpredictability and exhibit strong chaotic behavior. In this project, the PI considers the weakest (hence, most general) form of hyperbolicity, known as non-uniform hyperbolicity. The latter originated in the work of the PI. The study of non-uniformly hyperbolic systems is based upon the theory of Lyapunov exponents, which provides some ?practical? tools to detect and describe hyperbolic properties of the systems. The modern non-uniform hyperbolicity theory has numerous applications to ergodic theory, mathematical and statistical physics, Riemannian geometry, and other areas of mathematics and beyond. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>Building upon past results the PI will carry out a broad research program which includes the following topics: (1) Thermodynamic formalism for non-uniformly hyperbolic dynamical systems. Some ideas from geometric measure theory are used to construct equilibrium measures in hyperbolic dynamics. The new method is based on pushing forward by the dynamics the Caratheodory measure associated with the Caratheodory dimension structure generated by the potential; (2) Essential coexistence of hyperbolic and non-hyperbolic behavior. This is to understand how two different types of dynamical behavior - fully hyperbolic (positive entropy) and non-hyperbolic (zero entropy) - can coexist in an essential way. The project is aimed at constructing Hamiltonian systems and geodesic flows which exhibit the essential coexistence phenomenon thus providing new insights in the classical Kolmogorov-Arnold-Moser theory; (3) The study of two important conjectures in dynamics: (i) Katok's entropy conjecture, claiming that a volume preserving uniquely ergodic diffeomorphism has zero Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy; (ii) Baire Category conjecture, claiming that irregular sets for smooth dynamical systems and for continuous cocycles over them have the 2nd Baire Category; (4) Maps with exponential and polynomial decay of correlations on compact manifolds. The goal is to substantially advance the understanding of smooth realization problem by showing that any smooth manifold admits a volume preserving hyperbolic diffeomorphism with polynomial or exponential decay of correlations and also satisfies the Central Limit Theorem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Approximately 30% of students enrolled as Biology majors at Bloomfield College self-identify as Hispanic. Only half of all first-year biology majors go on to complete a second year and only one-third graduate with a degree in biology. Furthermore, the 4- and 6-year graduation rates for Hispanic students are approximately half of that of other ethnicities. Therefore, this project will develop and implement interventions to support first-year students at two specific points in their college careers: during the transition from high school to college and during the first year of college. Specifically, incoming first-year students will participate in a week-long intensive Biology Summer Enrichment Program (Bio-SEP), a Peer Coaching and Tutoring Program, and participate in Course-Based Undergraduate Research Experiences (CUREs) during their first year at the college. The project will allow us to assess the impact of specific interventions on the academic performance and retention of first-year biology majors who have risk factors known to prevent graduation: being a first-generation college student, coming from a low-income family, and belonging to a minority group.<br/><br/>The project has two specific objectives: 1) to ease the transition from high school to college and prepare incoming Biology first-year students for the rigors of college work and 2) to support students? academic performance and integration into the college while encouraging them to develop self-efficacy and their identity as biologists. Bio-SEP will give incoming first-year students a jumpstart on the content of the first-semester biology curriculum, teach them essential college study and social skills, and introduce them to faculty, staff, current students, peer coaches, and biology alumni. A faculty member will coordinate and lead trained peer coaches to deliver academic and social support via the Peer Coaching and Tutoring Program. In addition, students will participate in interdisciplinary CUREs delivered as laboratory modules in first-year introductory biology and chemistry courses. CUREs are well documented to help students develop confidence in their ability to perform basic scientific procedures, and increase their sense of belonging to the wider scientific community. The program outcomes will be evaluated continuously by monitoring grades, retention rates, and GPAs of all biology students who are impacted by the proposed interventions. Students? developing attitudes towards science will be evaluated using nationally benchmarked pre-and post-course surveys. Assessing the impact of these interventions will provide us with new knowledge about how to enhance undergraduate biology education and how to build capacity at our College. Ultimately, it will enable us to prepare our biology students to compete in, and contribute to a more diverse and capable STEM workforce.

As of 2019, it was estimated that 463 million people worldwide or almost 9% of the world adult population, had diabetes, with rates continuing to rise. The hallmark of diabetes is the failure of insulin secreting beta cells located in the pancreas. The beta cell is the only cell in the body that secretes insulin, which in turn is the only hormone able to lower plasma glucose levels. Given the importance of beta cells, numerous methods have been applied to study their physiology. Beta cells store insulin in small compartments called insulin granules and when blood sugar levels rise, these granules fuse with the cell membrane, allowing beta cells to release large quantities of insulin at once. Unfortunately, direct visualization of insulin granules is not straightforward, since current methods require external labels that can affect granule function and dynamics. The team of investigators has been developing a straightforward optical microscopic technique called Confocal Broadband Backscattering Microscopy (CBBM) that can visualize insulin granules without any labels and monitor their dynamics over the course of hours and even days, which could potentially lead to a new treatment for diabetes.  Project outcomes and efforts will be integrated into a course on optical microscopy in biology; provide training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and post graduate students; and enhance research experiences for K-12 students. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to develop a label-free microscopy system for functional imaging and continuous monitoring of insulin granules in live pancreatic islets in a custom islet-on-a-chip. The approach will combine novel confocal broadband backscattering microscopy (CBBM) with the existing confocal FRET and super-resolution STORM modalities, with all three sharing a major part of the optical train and having a common field of view. The CBBM technique will provide a functional image of a beta cell, resolve insulin granules, monitor the conversion of proinsulin into insulin inside the granules, and visualize granule-based insulin intercellular transport. The project will also develop a physical and mathematical model to describe light scattering from insulin granules within the confocal volume of the label-free microscopy system and an inverse algorithm to differentiate insulin and non-insulin granules label-free. These algorithms will be used to monitor temporal changes in granules and continuously visualize them in 3D during insulin intercellular transport and release. To better understand islet function and the optimal environments for transplantable islets, glucose exchanges will be combined with in vivo functional imaging in human pancreatic islets, allowing investigation of important feedback loops in glucose/insulin cycles. Experiments will also be performed to investigate critical differences between islets derived from diabetic and healthy subjects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project examines how differences in Critical-Zone processes influence topography through a comparative experiment of two different bedrock units on the tropical island of Puerto Rico. On the island, ancient volcanic rocks form steep, high peaks and have clay-rich soils, whereas granitic rocks underlie relatively more subdued, rolling hills covered by sandier soils. This study will evaluate the impact of these differences on the occurrence of landslides, the size of sediment grains that populate river channels, and the size and frequency of floods. The principal hypothesis is that landslides cut more deeply in the clay-rich soils and, as a result, deliver coarser sediment to rivers. The coarser sediment, in turn, better shields the river channel from erosion such that larger floods are needed to carve the underlying bedrock. In addition, the clay-rich volcanic soils retain more rainwater, resulting in fewer floods than areas covered by sandy granitic soils. The net result is that the volcanic rocks maintain a higher elevation and steeper topography than the granitic terrain. This project will test these ideas through detailed landslide mapping, grain-size measurements, statistical analyses of streamflow gaging data, and measurements of long-term landscape erosion rates. This project will form the basis for graduate and undergraduate research experiences and also engage additional students at the University of Puerto Rico, Mayagez and Colorado State University in an experiential learning, research, and cultural exchange program centered on comparing and contrasting the landscapes in Puerto Rico and Colorado.<br/><br/>Variations in topographic relief, steepness, and height are often observed to correlate with differences in bedrock geology. Most often, these changes are interpreted to result from differences in the erodibility of the underlying bedrock. On the tropical island of Puerto Rico intermediate-to-mafic volcaniclastic units underlie high relief, steep mountains, whereas felsic-rich granitic-to-granodioritic rocks are characterized by gentler, rolling hills. Preliminary results indicate that unweathered bedrock strength and fracture density between these two rock units is similar, implying the differences in primary rock strength or erodibility cannot explain the stark contrast in topography. Previous studies show that the soils developed atop each of these rock units are distinct, with the more mafic units comprised of clay-rich soils and sandier soils developed in the more felsic units. These differences in soil characteristics and associated Critical Zone architecture promote relief production in the volcaniclastic units relative to the granitic units. Specifically, differences in the Critical Zone affect the magnitude of incision thresholds by controlling bedload grain size distributions and the frequency of floods that breach these thresholds by modulating shallow, subsurface hydrology. These hypotheses will be tested by mapping landslide locations, measuring grain size distributions in sediment deposits, analyzing flood statistics from existing stream gaging stations, and calculating long-term erosion rates from cosmogenic radionuclides. Datasets will be synthesized into a modeling framework that predicts fluvial landscape relief as a function of rock strength, the magnitude of incision thresholds, and the frequency of threshold breaching floods.

This kind of institution is under-studied, and this project will serve both as a proof-of-concept and prototype for other primarily undergraduate institutions.  Saint Mary's College of California will implement a broad approach that includes: (1) designing a science-motivated and contextualized calculus readiness course; (2) integrating research-oriented modules in introductory labs for chemistry and physics; (3) introducing a multidisciplinary science bridge midway through the year; and (4) redeveloping existing advising cohorts and developing peer mentoring for first year STEM students.  The investigators will also (5) establish an educator learning community to foster a climate conducive to learning and inclusion, and to support equitable and excellent STEM education.  The expected outcomes of this work are to increase the retention rate of STEM-interested students, reduce observed gaps in retention and success rates for students from historically underrepresented groups and effect positive changes in the science identity of first year STEM-interested students.  <br/><br/>The accompanying STEM education research has two areas of focus: the effectiveness of the science contextualized math course compared to a traditional calculus readiness course; and characterizing the nature of the peer mentor-mentee relationship and how its aspects affect science identity and student retention in STEM.  To assess the effectiveness of the science contextualized math course, the investigators will compare retention rates, success rates, and course grades in STEM courses of students who participate in the new science contextualized course to those who participated in the existing model of remediation. They will also collect qualitative data to address the related question of how well the science contextualized math course supports the development of science identity. To assess the peer mentor-mentee relationship and its impacts, the investigators will analyze qualitative data from post mentor-mentee meeting reports, as well as compare first year retention and success rates of students with peer mentors compared to those without peer mentors.

By analyzing both modern and ancient marine sedimentary records, PI Belanger will determine the range of ecosystem changes possible with future warming and identify ocean regions that are most vulnerable to its negative impacts, including the loss of oceanic oxygen. This assessment is important for the maintenance of economically valuable marine resources. Further, this work will identify ocean regions important for CO2 storage during past warming and improve our ability to forecast how the global carbon cycle will respond to ongoing climate change, which is critical for formulating national climate-related polices. PI Belanger will mentor first-generation college students in research related to this project via a structured program developed through this grant, which will enhance their retention in STEM fields and, thus, broaden our future STEM workforce. <br/><br/>The delivery of organic matter produced in the surface water to the deep ocean fluctuates with climate change, which affects the amount of CO2 stored in the ocean as well as the distribution of oxygen and organisms. Single-celled organisms, such as benthic foraminifera, living on the ocean floor vary depending on the organic matter and oxygen available, thus their fossilized remains preserved in ocean sediment cores can be used to reconstruct these environmental factors over time. This project will create a global database of modern and fossil benthic foraminifera, quantify the relationships between benthic foraminifera and modern oceanic conditions, and apply those relationships to marine sedimentary core records to reconstruct spatial patterns in oceanic changes during past warming events.

Why are increasing numbers of people struggling to form and maintain social ties? Connecting with others takes time, energy, and sometimes money. These resources are limited, so people must decide which friendships, if any, are worth the investment. Should they join a club to make new friends? Or should they focus their time, energy, and money on strengthening their existing friendships? And how should they invest their time and energy during a conversation ? by making small talk or delving deeper into a new topic? The answer depends on a person?s personality and goals. But it also depends on the context: for instance, whether a person is new to the community, how much turnover there is in the community, and whether the community is rich in resources or suffering from scarcity. This research asks if people adjust their social connection strategies to optimally fit the context. A mismatch between a person?s environment and the selected approach to socializing might increase the risk of becoming social disconnected. The findings are expected to inform future interventions aimed at reducing loneliness and improving the health of communities.<br/><br/>The current project examines how context influences people?s decisions to explore new opportunities in social connections versus exploit existing ones. Seven studies measure and manipulate social constraints in a given context to determine a) how people choose interaction partners, b) how they choose conversation topics, and c) the psychosocial consequences of social exploration and exploitation. Each study examines social behavior in a different context, including a computer game with hypothetical social partners, a classroom with peers, an online chatroom, a video call, and daily life on a college campus. The research combines controlled experiments and agent-based modeling with naturalistic behaviors captured by crowd tracking, mobile sensing, and topic analysis. Integrating the interdisciplinary explore-exploit framework with social psychology advances an understanding of the causes and consequences of everyday social choices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will study how long-term climate goals, as indicated in countries? NDCs, and short-term implementation of climate policies through pandemic recovery spending plans affect each other and why some countries lead in climate policy implementation, while others lag.  The study is based on the collection of and analyses of large data sets across several countries.  This study, to be carried out by research teams from several countries, will help identify opportunities for policymakers and international financial institutions on how to promote and implement climate change policy ambitions.  In addition to helping to understand cross country differences in climate policy implementation, the results of this research will provide inputs into formulating efficient and innovative climate policies in the US.<br/><br/><br/>This research project will study two inter-related issues.  First, it studies the links between long-term national climate ambitions enshrined in NDC updates and short-term implementation plans embedded in COVID-19 recovery packages, and fiscal reform. Second, it investigates the political and economic drivers underlying differences in climate ambitions and implementation abilities in these types of policy intervention across countries. To do so, the project integrates political science and economics, focusing on the role of policy feedback and financing conditions in driving climate ambition and climate policy interventions. In a mixed-methods design, the project combines descriptive statistical analyses with qualitative comparative case studies in the three analytical tasks. The intellectual merit of this project lies in identifying patterns in the relationship of long-term climate targets and plans (NDCs) and short-term implementation (economic recovery spending) as well as the causes of cross-national variation in this relationship.

One of the topics of this project is universality, which is the appearance of certain universal (or common) local statistical behaviors for different systems. The research is also motivated by integrability, which is the existence of many conserved quantities in certain nonlinear systems used to describe their behavior over time. The project focuses on Schrdinger operators, central to quantum mechanics, and related systems in one dimension; the mathematical methods developed have the potential to illuminate other mathematical models and physical applications such as electron conductivity in disordered materials and signal transmission using solitons. Several graduate students and a postdoc will be trained, and conference organization as well as writing of a monograph on reflectionless operators is planned.<br/><br/>One focus of this project is the application of de Branges canonical systems to universality limits for orthogonal polynomials and related systems. A new approach co-authored by the PI reformulates the question in terms of a limit of canonical systems and uses that to obtain a very general criterion for bulk universality; substantial extensions of this approach to other universality phenomena will be studied. Another focus of the project will be the development of inverse spectral theory for reflectionless Schrdinger operators for Dirichlet-regular Widom spectra without the ?direct Cauchy theorem? property; the structure of the isospectral torus in this regime will have immediate consequences for the Korteweg-de Vries equation with almost periodic initial data. Finally, of interest will be new research directions made possible by the recent development of Stahl-Totik regularity for Schrdinger operators, such as the study of sum rules for Schrdinger operators with arbitrary essential spectra.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These inequities may be magnified during times of crisis, like the COVID- 19 pandemic. Miami University is an R2 public liberal arts university located on three local campuses in Hamilton, Middletown, and Oxford, Ohio. These campuses work to enhance the socio-economic, cultural, and racial diversity of the student body?something that benefits from diverse faculty. While Miami creates a vibrant learning community for students, the expectation for Miami faculty to be both exemplary teachers and research scholars creates demands on faculty that can lead to burnout. These demands may disproportionately impact faculty equity on the basis and intersectionality of gender, race, and international status. This project aims to identify and evaluate stressors both quantitatively and qualitatively through examination of institutional data on hiring and salaries; on institutional policies and practices on hiring, promotion and tenure, parental and family leaves, and research leaves; and on institutional tools used to evaluate teaching and research successes. Also, this project will evaluate how inequities may have been exacerbated during the COVID-19 pandemic.<br/><br/>The goals of this project are 1) to lay the foundation for strategic recruitment and retention of faculty across gender, race, and international status by identifying barriers and structural impediments that impact STEM diversity, and 2) to set the stage for institutional transformation beyond the grant period to reduce inequities that hinder these groups of faculty during and outside of a global crisis. The research team will examine institutional data, and conduct surveys and in-person interviews. The results of this assessment aim to help reshape policies that will support retention and recruitment of diverse faculty. The data acquired in this study will be reported using multi-media methods, including technical peer-reviewed journal articles; conference presentations; and an ESTEAM website. STEM faculty at Miami will have opportunities to be involved in two programs initiated by this project: 1) An ESTEAM Faculty Learning Community that will review and discuss literature on equity in higher education, identify potential solutions for successful recruiting, retention, and promotion of diverse faculty, and develop ESTEAM Presentation Modules on STEM-diversity that can be shared with administrators, faculty, and students; and 2) a ?STEM-Equity? mentoring program, which will aim to improve the climate for all STEM faculty. Results from this mentorship approach will be documented and distributed to other universities through the university?s ESTEAM website and through scholarly work. <br/><br/>The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions. Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate. ADVANCE ""Catalyst"" awards provide support for institutional equity assessments and the development of five-year faculty equity strategic plans at academic, non-profit institutions of higher education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This changing technological climate and the resultant concurrent global competition necessitate transformation at every level of automotive development ? from EV designers to EV technicians. The demand for skilled EV manufacturing and service industry technicians is substantial and is predicted to increase at a rate where demand outpaces quantity. Workers aging out of the workforce, the lack of advanced STEM skills for those currently in the workforce, and increased economic expansion are contributing factors to this deficit. Collaboration among educators and employers must occur to advance the understanding of workforce challenges and opportunities. To meet the need, a faculty-driven consortium of two-year Institutions of Higher Education (IHEs), other ATE projects and centers, and industry will collaborate to address the next generation cross-disciplinary workforce needs of the Electric Vehicle (EV) manufacturing and service industry through an innovative hybrid virtual and augmented reality (VR/AR) education approach. <br/><br/>The consortium project partners include: Volvo, Daimler, BMW, Proterra, Bosch, Duke Energy, Michelin, the Upstate SC Alliance, the South Carolina Manufacturing Extension Partnership, the South Carolina Technical College System, the National Center for Autonomous Technologies, the National Cybersecurity Training and Education Center, the Regional Center for Nuclear Education, and the Northwest Engineering and Vehicle Technology Exchange.

Unmanned aerial vehicles and other mobile robots rely on image streams from onboard cameras, as well as communication with other autonomous systems, to perform cooperative tasks such as navigation and collision avoidance. Vulnerabilities in networked vision-guided systems can be exploited using powerful machine-learning methods to launch adversarial attacks that compromise function, endanger human lives, and damage property. This research project advances a new foundational framework for detecting and responding to stealthy and malicious cyber-attacks that simultaneously target mission planning, control, perception, and sensor data. This framework will enhance the reliability of vision-guided autonomous systems such as self-driving cars and networked aerial vehicles, hardening these against cyber threats and malicious actions. Efforts aimed at achieving broader impact include integration of research activities in project-based graduate courses, as well as engagement of undergraduate students in faculty-mentored summer research projects that motivate their interest in STEM, graduate education, and careers in high-tech industries. Outreach programs will use mobile robotic demonstration platforms to inspire K-12 students to pursue engineering-related education paths.<br/><br/>This research aims to make fundamental and rigorous contributions to the use of control theory and machine-learning tools for characterizing and defending against stealthy attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in vision-guided, networked autonomous systems, with particular emphasis on high-dimensional visual data. It achieves this outcome by developing an online learning framework able to synthesize control policies from image frames in real-time, without current restrictions to offline implementations that fail to include system dynamics in the control loop. For multi-agent vision-guided dynamical systems, this research provides a novel and holistic framework that characterizes stealthy attacks based on the unobservable subspaces of both the physical system dynamics and the neural network model used for perception. Using stochastic optimization and simulation, the attack detection methodology extends the existing model-based observer methods for linear time-invariant systems to deal with stealthy attacks against a networked system with autonomous agents represented by general time-varying and nonlinear models. Evaluation of the theoretical framework relies on experiments with quadcopters in an indoor laboratory environment, as well as the use of advanced simulation software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

According to the Bureau of Labor and Statistics, the need for welders is expected to grow 8 percent from 2020 to 2030. This project will address this workforce need by incorporating significant improvements to an existing Welding Technology Associates of Science degree program. Improvements include incorporating advanced technologies and certification requirements across the program curriculum, use of nontraditional instructional deliveries (virtual reality and hybrid flexible, or HyFlex), performance assessments, faculty professional development, and program outreach. These improvements are projected to increase the number of students who successfully complete the program by 7 percent each year of the project. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to provide a model for two-year colleges to integrate smart welding technologies into their certificate and degree programs so students are prepared to build successful careers in advanced manufacturing sectors. The project will modernize two existing instructional labs to facilitate use of smart technologies inside each welding booth and into each robotic cell. These smart technologies involve use of live weld process control and monitoring software and virtual reality systems. This creates a platform from which students can gauge their own progress in addition to providing instructors valuable data analytics to identify and assess students? progress. This assessment-driven approach is expected to contribute to the development of standardized welding education practices. Faculty teaching in the welding technology program will earn certifications offered by the National Coalition of Certification Centers to facilitate administering the required performance exams. Students earning these certifications will be prepared to enter the workforce upon completion of the program. This project will consist of significant outreach by hosting live events at local junior and high schools using the program?s existing welding roadshow trailer. The project will also leverage existing agreements with secondary education to build a K-14 pipeline of skilled technicians using conventional and HyFlex instructional deliveries. Summer manufacturing camps will be offered that focus on providing entrepreneurial skills training along with hands-on project-based activities in the welding and metal fabrication labs. The project will develop partnerships with area welding companies to collaboratively design course offerings and curriculum with input from an Industry and Business Team. These efforts are designed to result in a robust program that facilitates hands-on learning experiences centered on aligning student ability with employment opportunities in the field. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program that focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced-technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new instrumentation will greatly enhance analytical capabilities in new geochemistry methods at the University of Washington (UW) to precisely measure the temperature and chemistry of carbonate minerals when formed in soils, lakes, oceans, fault zones, hydrothermal systems, and laboratory experiments. The temperature estimates and cutting-edge chemical analyses will support research on modern and ancient environments to study Earth?s climate system, past atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations, the origin of landforms like the Colorado Plateau, and geologic drivers of biodiversity. Analyses of corals and shelled organisms will support environmental and marine sciences research relevant to ecology, physiology, and biochemistry. The instrumentation will also enable analysis of minerals formed in fault zones and hydrothermal systems to study the interactions of sub-surface fluids and faulting, ancient earthquakes, and chemical reactions relevant to ore deposits, critical metals, and carbon dioxide sequestration. The research and educational opportunities provided by this instrument acquisition will advance trans-disciplinary research and education at UW and in the Earth science community. The award will advance equity in undergraduate laboratory training and research through direct support of underrepresented minority students and broad dissemination of best practices for inclusive engagement with undergraduates. The instrument acquisition will substantially enhance infrastructure for essential Earth sciences research and education and contribute to technological innovation, societally-relevant scientific discovery, and building diverse STEM talent. <br/><br/>This award supports the acquisition and installation of a new carbonate sample preparation device and high-precision gas-source isotope-ratio mass spectrometer (IRMS) to measure clumped isotopologues of CO2 at UW, to advance interdisciplinary research in tectonics, paleoclimate, geochemistry, and other Earth-science disciplines. The acquisition of the IRMS and sample preparation system will enable rapid, high-precision complete stable isotopic analysis (masses 44 - 49 inclusive) of small (<0.5 mg) carbonate samples for a wide range of ongoing and new research including novel applications of dual-clumped isotope analysis, and free up existing instrumentation to substantially increase capacity for novel triple-oxygen-isotope analyses. The system will replace 1) an off-line custom preparation system for large (8-10 mg) carbonate samples, 2) an existing IRMS with modified collector for traditional clumped (mass 47 excess) work acquired with NSF funding in 2012, both of which will be optimized to support carbonate oxygen-17 excess analyses; and 3) replace ageing instrumentation that no longer provides reliable conventional carbonate bulk stable isotope data. In this way, the proposed instrument acquisition will be leveraged to expand capabilities for carbonate oxygen-17 excess analysis, traditional bulk stable isotope analyses, and enable new high-precision dual clumped isotope (47 and 48 excess) analyses of small samples, substantially benefitting hundreds of Earth-science researchers and students. The proposed research is tightly integrated with education and outreach. The project will increase undergraduate geoscience lab opportunities through 1) direct support for student technical training and research in partnership with a cohort program for underrepresented minority undergraduates, and 2) national dissemination of research-based practices for enhancing belonging, accessibility, justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion in undergraduate geoscience laboratory research and training.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While migration is among the most effective strategies to improve the functioning of labor markets and reduce poverty, many individuals, particularly vulnerable ones, face large barriers to profitable migration opportunities.  As a result, labor shortages exist in one part of a country/region while high unemployment rates exist in other parts, thus slowing economic growth and increasing poverty.  The project will leverage an on-going field experiment in a high-migration region to evaluate a migration mentorship program.  The innovatively designed experiment will help to answer whether policies that leverage social networks and support systems can help people migrate to better opportunities, with many potential applications to many regions, including wealthier regions of the world.  The results of this research project will help to improve the functioning of domestic and international labor markets, hence increase economic growth, and reduce poverty in the U.S. and globally.<br/><br/>This project will generate experimental evidence on the effects of changes in social network structure on migration. The project will make use of an existing phone sample in a high-circular-migration region of Nepal.

The interventions are:  (1) standard information on migration opportunities delivered by program staff; (2) standard information on migration opportunities plus idiosyncratic information delivered by an experienced migrant from their locality; and (3) intervention (2) plus multiple 1-1 meetings and the opportunity to migrate with an experienced migrant from their locality.  The researchers will collect additional data on 2,000 potential migrants in the social networks of these potential program recipients. They will conduct six rounds of phone surveys before the intervention, during the intervention period, during the migration season, and after the migration season. These surveys will track changes in beliefs and attitudes towards migration to various destinations, migration and migration experiences, earnings and remittances, and the welfare of family members at home.

This ice sheet mass loss is primarily driven by the thinning, retreat, and acceleration of glaciers in contact with the ocean. Observations from the field and satellites indicate that glaciers are sensitive to changes at the ice-ocean interface and that the increase in submarine melting is likely to be driven by the discharge of meltwater from underneath the glacier known as subglacial meltwater plumes. The melting of glacier ice also directly adds a large volume of freshwater into the ocean, potentially causing significant changes in the circulation of ocean waters that regulate global heat transport, making ice-ocean interactions an important potential factor in climate change and variability. The ability to predict, and hence adequately respond to, climate change and sea-level rise therefore depends on our knowledge of the small-scale processes occurring in the vicinity of subglacial meltwater plumes at the ice-ocean interface. Currently, understanding of the underlying physics is incomplete; for example, different models of glacier-ocean interaction could yield melting rates that vary over a factor of five for the same heat supply from the ocean. It is then very difficult to assess the reliability of predictive models. This project will use comprehensive laboratory experiments to study how the melt rates of glaciers in the vicinity of plumes are affected by the ice roughness, ice geometry, ocean turbulence, and ocean density stratification at the ice-ocean interface. These experiments will then be used to develop new and improved predictive models of ice-sheet melting by the ocean. This project builds bridges between modern experimental fluid mechanics and glaciology with the goal of leading to advances in both fields. As a part of this work, two graduate students will receive interdisciplinary training and each year two undergraduate students will be trained in experimental fluid mechanics to assist in this work and develop their own research projects.<br/><br/>This project consists of a comprehensive experimental program designed for studying the melt rates of glacier ice under the combined influences of (1) turbulence occurring near and at the ice-ocean interface, (2) density stratification in the ambient water column, (3) irregularities in the bottom topology of an ice shelf, and (4) differing spatial distributions of multiple meltwater plumes. The objective of the experiments is to obtain high-resolution data of the velocity, density, and temperature near/at the ice-ocean interface, which will then be used to improve understanding of melt processes down to scales of millimeters, and to devise new, more robust numerical models of glacier evolution and sea-level rise. Specially, laser-based, optical techniques in experimental fluid mechanics (particle image velocity and laser-induced fluorescence) will be used to gather the data, and the experiments will be conducted using refractive-index matching techniques to eliminate changes in refractive indices that could otherwise bias the measurements. The experiments will be run inside a climate-controlled cold room to mimic field conditions (ocean temperature from 0-10 degrees C). The project will use 3D-printing to create different casting molds for making ice blocks with different types of roughness. The goal is to investigate how ice melt rate changes as a function of the properties of the plume, the ambient ocean water, and the geometric properties of the ice interface. Based on the experimental findings, this project will develop and test a new integral-plume-model coupled to a regional circulation model (MITgcm) that can be used to predict the effects of glacial melt on ocean circulation and sea-level rise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ergodic theory focusses on the statistical behavior of dynamical systems. Applications of ergodic theory are widespread: from traffic modeling to aerospace engineering and population dynamics. It is natural and of practical importance to generalize the role of time in a dynamical system to more complicated groups of symmetries. This generalized notion of dynamics leads to applications in statistical physics, number theory and geometry. However, new tools are needed especially in the particular case when the group of symmetries is non-amenable, which means that boundary phenomena are too significant to be safely ignored. Non-amenable groups naturally arise in many parts of mathematics such as geometry and number theory. This project is concerned with developing the tools needed to analyze the statistical behavior of non-amenable group actions by generalizing ergodic theory to this context. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The research goals of this projects are: (1) Measured equivalence relations (MERs) arise from actions of groups. MERs are both a tool and a source of interesting examples for extending classical ergodic theory to non-amenable group actions. This project aims to develop the structure of MERs by classifying the normal subequivalence relations of low-dimensional MERs and finding MER-analogs of objects from geometric group theory. (2) Sofic entropy theory is a generalization of classical entropy to actions of sofic groups, a class of groups including amenable and residually finite groups. It is relatively new. Specific goals include: determine conditions under which entropy is invariant under orbit-equivalence, develop a locally compact version of sofic entropy theory, classify mixing Markov chains over free groups and determine how sofic entropy depends on the choice of sofic approximation. (3) A major tool for extending ergodic theory to non-amenable groups is sofic approximation, in which the action of the group on itself is approximated locally on average by a sequence of partial actions on finite sets. There are no known cases when this tool cannot be used. A major goal of this project is to find non-sofic groups and actions of low-dimensional groups by modifying recent techniques used to solve Connes? Embedding Conjecture. (4) Sofic approximation fits into the broader framework of Benjamini-Schramm (BS) convergence, in which one considers sequence of finite graphs or compact measured metric spaces and the limit object is a random pointed graph or space. Naturally occurring sequences include random translation surfaces, quadratic differentials and measured laminations. This project will determine the BS-limit of these sequences and relate them to known objects such as the Curien-Werner Markovian triangulation and Gaussian Analytic Functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unmanned aerial vehicles and other mobile robots rely on image streams from onboard cameras, as well as communication with other autonomous systems, to perform cooperative tasks such as navigation and collision avoidance. Vulnerabilities in networked vision-guided systems can be exploited using powerful machine-learning methods to launch adversarial attacks that compromise function, endanger human lives, and damage property. This research project advances a new foundational framework for detecting and responding to stealthy and malicious cyber-attacks that simultaneously target mission planning, control, perception, and sensor data. This framework will enhance the reliability of vision-guided autonomous systems such as self-driving cars and networked aerial vehicles, hardening these against cyber threats and malicious actions. Efforts aimed at achieving broader impact include integration of research activities in project-based graduate courses, as well as engagement of undergraduate students in faculty-mentored summer research projects that motivate their interest in STEM, graduate education, and careers in high-tech industries. Outreach programs will use mobile robotic demonstration platforms to inspire K-12 students to pursue engineering-related education paths.<br/><br/>This research aims to make fundamental and rigorous contributions to the use of control theory and machine-learning tools for characterizing and defending against stealthy attacks that exploit vulnerabilities in vision-guided, networked autonomous systems, with particular emphasis on high-dimensional visual data. It achieves this outcome by developing an online learning framework able to synthesize control policies from image frames in real-time, without current restrictions to offline implementations that fail to include system dynamics in the control loop. For multi-agent vision-guided dynamical systems, this research provides a novel and holistic framework that characterizes stealthy attacks based on the unobservable subspaces of both the physical system dynamics and the neural network model used for perception. Using stochastic optimization and simulation, the attack detection methodology extends the existing model-based observer methods for linear time-invariant systems to deal with stealthy attacks against a networked system with autonomous agents represented by general time-varying and nonlinear models. Evaluation of the theoretical framework relies on experiments with quadcopters in an indoor laboratory environment, as well as the use of advanced simulation software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently underutilized parts of the spectrum, at very high frequencies, can provide massive bandwidth, and new possibilities for services that require high responsiveness, such as self-driving cars or augmented/virtual reality (AR/VR). Such services are, in addition, critical and sensitive, requiring thus high security. Traditional approaches to ensuring security exploit cryptographic approaches that can add non-negligible delay because of their complexity; some are even being steadily undermined by the fast progress of quantum computing. The existing security techniques that are post-quantum secure are even slower and more onerous, rendering them less attractive for delay-critical applications.  This project addresses these challenges in an integrated way by making active and synergistic use of the characteristics of operating at very high frequencies and of recent mathematical developments in systems that remain secure under quantum computing attacks. The approach also offers low complexity and is therefore compatible with low-delay, highly responsive system requirements. <br/><br/>At high frequencies, the location of an eavesdropper deeply affects their ability to listen in on private communications when the appropriate hardware, namely antennas, are used. With the right antennas, a legitimate receiver can be given an edge, even a slight one, over the eavesdropper and that edge can be turned into a key advantage through mathematical transformations. The approach relies on mathematically pre-processing data in such a way that an eavesdropping intercepting part of the communication cannot recover the missing data, unless 100% of it is available, thus thwarting the effort. Furthermore, wireless communications are often subjected to noise and interference, ranging from a microwave oven to a neighboring user's activity. In order to combat those effects, the data encoding mechanism must be robust, while still maintaining security. Very new developments in techniques for combatting noise lend themselves well to work with the sort of security approaches to be developed in this project. The outcomes of this project will be high speed, low delay, cost-effective, energy efficient communications that can remain secure even to sophisticated, powerful attackers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, a pipeline of manual and labor-intensive practices fragmented across disparate tools makes it difficult to scale fact-checking efforts. As a result, fact-checkers are inundated with information and lack effective dissemination mechanisms for countering misinformation early and effectively. To address these challenges, this project combines the complementary information processing strengths of humans and computation to transform the efficiency, effectiveness, and scale of fact-checking. The project can enable fact-checkers to spot misinformation early, prioritize effort, and unify the various tools and techniques used for fact-checking. The research outcomes can scale the work of human fact-checkers and boost information literacy in society, which can significantly reduce the number of people exposed to misinformation.<br/><br/>The project draws upon the core components of security incident response (i.e., preparation, detection, containment, and post-incident activity) to transform the ad-hoc, time-consuming, and small-scale nature of current fact-checking practices with a security-analyst perspective and a unified user experience (UX). The research approach leverages the power of computation and personalization while retaining the synergistic advantages of the human fact-checker in the loop. The interdisciplinary sociotechnical approach involves empirical studies of fact-checker practices, collection of data and development of computational techniques to address their challenges and barriers, and design explorations of novel UI/UX techniques to connect humans and computation. The research incorporates a feedback loop to disseminate fact-checking outcomes, thus boosting their visibility and impact on end users exposed to misinformation. The researchers are developing early warning and detection techniques to reduce the time between misinformation generation and fact-check dissemination and are employing prioritization and personalization for more effective and efficient use of fact-checking resources.

This project addresses the nationwide growing shortage of certified STEM teachers in high-need communities. Many Kentucky STEM teachers are teaching outside of their field, and school districts in Kentucky are collapsing science courses and reducing STEM course offerings. Additionally, STEM teachers do not reflect the demographic make of students in culturally and ethnically diverse classrooms. Project outcomes will include the certification of STEM teachers in high-need schools to remedy the 6-12 STEM teacher shortages in Kentucky. A STEM Teacher Education Learning Community will form a new ecosystem and provide synergy in STEM teacher education among the project?s collaborative partners, which include the Jefferson County Public School District, the Kentucky Community and Technical College System (KCTCS), Academies of Louisville, the Kentucky Science Center, and the University of Kentucky. <br/><br/>The goals of this project at Bellarmine University (BU) include the recruitment, preparation, peer mentoring, academic support, and retention of first-generation and minority STEM students that will produce 25 prospective highly qualified diverse 6-12 STEM teachers over five years. An underlying goal is that these teachers will have an understanding of culturally responsive teaching (CRT) and will be equipped to teach across cultural boundaries in high-need schools. Scholarships/stipends will be awarded to high-achieving undergraduates in their junior and senior years majoring in Mathematics, and to graduate students in the final post-baccalaureate year, who have a bachelor?s degree in Physics, Biology, Chemistry, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, or Mathematics. Certification will be obtained via one of two possible pathways. One pathway will be through a post-baccalaureate Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) middle and/or secondary teacher certification for STEM students and STEM professionals who have completed a bachelor?s degree in a targeted STEM discipline. A second pathway will be available to undergraduate mathematics majors who are dual majoring in secondary mathematics education to obtain secondary certification in Mathematics. This project will provide summer internships in STEM education at the Kentucky Science Center to 16 high-achieving undergraduate BU and KCTCS STEM students. The project team will also implement a CRT-focused professional learning experience at the University of Kentucky. Field experiences during senior and MAT years will provide classroom teaching experience in a diverse setting. Relevant data for evaluation will be gathered from surveys, observations, performance in CRT seminars and Maker Fairs, summer internships, and MAT coursework/field experiences. Persistence, retention, outcomes/perceptions, and success as prospective 6-12 STEM teachers in high-need schools will be evaluated. This project will generate new knowledge through data analyses of evaluation questions; results will add to the growing body of knowledge in STEM teacher education and preparation relevant to CRT. Project findings and outcomes will be disseminated through conference presentations and peer-reviewed journal publication. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

Important questions to be addressed include: How do hydrological, hydrothermal and/or volcanic systems respond to climate change and glacier expansion and retreat? What are the timing and mechanisms that control these responses? Answering these questions has significant impacts on hazard assessments (phreatic eruptions and hydrothermal explosions), geothermal exploration, and mineral deposits. El Tatio volcanic-hydrothermal system, Central Andes, provides an ideal natural laboratory to investigate these interactions. El Tatio has been active since the last deglaciation and preserves exceptional morpho-stratigraphic evidence of volcanic, glacial, and hydrothermal activity. Unlike past studies, focusing on large continental ice masses during the Last Glacial Maximum, El Tatio experienced smaller alpine or mountain glaciations. That configuration is more representative of the world-wide distribution of glaciers and the processes occurring due to modern climate change. Led by an early career Latino-woman, this project will intensify collaborations with Chilean Universities, and will engage historically marginalized native communities who own the land.<br/><br/>This project will use an interdisciplinary approach that brings together experts from different US institutions and Chile, which propose to address the following: (i) to establish spatial and temporal linkages between glacier fluctuations including deglaciation and the onset of hydrothermal and/or volcanic activity by constraining the field distribution and timing of different events; and (ii) to make quantitative estimation of the hydrothermal responses to glacial unloading, changes in water and heat supply using field data (ages and estimation of ice thickness) and numerical models of multiphase flow and deformation in heterogeneous porous media. Results from this study will provide a better understanding of the interrelated and competing controls of hydrothermal responses (for example, glacier distribution, thickness, and rates of advance/recession; rheology; permeability; and reservoir depth).<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Hydrologic Sciences Program, the Geomorphology and Land Use Dynamics Program, and the Petrology and Geochemistry Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, their unexplored diversity?and the extreme paucity of taxonomic and molecular data from benthic marine ecosystems? represents one of the major challenges in biology and currently limits our capacity to understand the accelerating consequences of environmental change. This project uses cutting-edge -Omics approaches in conjunction with classical morphological taxonomy to characterize patterns regarding the biodiversity, evolution, and ecology of free-living marine nematodes and their host-associated microbiomes. First, this work uses eDNA metabarcoding to determine how overall meiofaunal biodiversity changes across marine habitat transitions (depth, salinity) and gradients of environmental stress (pollution, oxygen availability). Second, the project identifies key nematode lineages which maintain ?cosmopolitan? distributions across key marine gradients, and lineages which can tolerate the most extreme environmental stressors. Finally, this work characterizes the nematode genomic adaptations and host-associated microbiome patterns that may facilitate nematode dispersal and adaptation to extreme environmental stress. Educational activities are being strongly integrated with data generation and analysis of nematode -Omics datasets. The investigator leads an effort to build foundational computational skill sets in undergraduate and graduate students at the University of Georgia, establishing and growing a local bioinformatics community of practice. Weeklong summer hackathons aimed at intermediate bioinformatics learners merge data visualization and science communication tools and teach participants how to ?tell stories through data?. Finally, this project engages undergraduate researchers in ?sediments to species? workflows, providing interdisciplinary education in classical molecular systematics, bioinformatics, and science communication.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to carry out the first large-scale investigation of free-living marine nematodes that that collects molecular data across marine habitat transitions (salinity, depth) and gradients of environmental stress (pollution, oxygen availability), providing a comparative dataset for the existing body of historical (morphological) taxonomic studies. This research uses a novel approach that combines traditional light microcopy, environmental DNA sequencing, and single-worm genome sequencing in order to advance scientific knowledge of free-living nematodes and their ecological and evolutionary roles in marine habitats worldwide. The resulting datasets produce an important baseline of global nematode biodiversity in shallow-water and deep-sea marine habitats, and illuminate ?dark areas? in the Nematode Tree of Life (lineages which are currently poorly sampled and lack molecular DNA barcodes). This project combines interdisciplinary research themes spanning marine nematode systematics, bioinformatics, and microbial ecology, with a strong integration of computational training and science communication for undergraduate and graduate students across all project aims. Research outputs are rapidly advancing our knowledge of the structure and function of seafloor habitats worldwide, and molecular datasets lay the groundwork for future genome-enabled studies of diverse free-living nematode groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multiaccess Edge Computing (MEC) enables IoT devices to offload their delay-sensitive resource-intensive tasks to nearby edge devices. However, spatio-temporal uncertainties due to user mobility bring the most challenging obstacles for MEC in providing predictable performance and guaranteed Quality-of-Service (QoS). The research mission of this CAREER proposal is to develop foundations of proactive and collaborative mobility-aware MEC systems to improve QoS for IoT applications, minimize data movement, and optimize the overall system performance. This project focuses on all aspects of mobility in MEC, which include these scenarios: (i) mobile IoT devices/edge devices move as their own decisions? (ii) the system makes the use of mobile edge devices to move to a specific demand area? and (iii) the system incentives the mobile IoT devices to move to receive better QoS. In support of the project mission, this project will design a novel data-driven approach to infer vital mobility patterns leading to QoS violations, and will develop a unique proactive offloading and service deployment approach based on an integrated community detection and multidimensional flow approach. This project will investigate the design of a proactive learning-based approach to act autonomously based on any changes that may lead to QoS violation. This project will facilitate dynamic placement and relocation of mobile edge devices in providing low-latency edge services. This project will also investigate the effects of suggesting location changes to IoT devices and edge devices with location flexibility, and will design a reverse-auction mechanism and a two-sided mechanism to balance the system load and further improve response time.<br/><br/>This CAREER project will integrate teaching, research, and outreach activities to broaden exposure to systems research and increase student retention and representation of underrepresented students by providing meaningful and exciting student involvement and finely-tuned mentorship. The proposed research plan will address the technical challenges in building mobility-aware MEC systems for realtime processing demands of mobile IoT applications to enable edge intelligence along the cloud-to-thing continuum and will enrich the scientific knowledge of advanced computing system design. The availability of collaborative mobile edge devices will improve the quality of edge services for end-users and will empower many more innovative applications that are simply not yet possible today. The proposed educational plan will educate students on modern notions of MEC and prepare them for related professions. A substantial quantity of the materials of this project will be made publicly available online in the form of tutorials, talks, publications, codes, datasets, and testbeds.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With partners from the University of Virginia, the University of Washington (Bothell), and the University of Arizona, the project will implement a significant redesign of the workshops based on what has been learned from participant feedback, workshop evaluations, research into faculty professional development, and the needs of today?s faculty. Effective practices for enhancing diversity, equity and inclusion will be integrated throughout the workshops. In addition to tenure-track faculty, the project will foster the participation of adjunct, part-time, and primarily instructional faculty, who, collectively, teach an increasing fraction of physics and astronomy courses across the country.  <br/><br/>The project redesign will add four new components: (1) a restructured program delivered by a core set of well-prepared presenters, focusing on the development of participants? Individual Development Plans; (2) an overarching emphasis on the professional development of the ?whole faculty member,? as faculty members grow as educators, researchers, and professionals; (3) an enhanced set of post-workshop activities to provide coaching and feedback for the workshop participants as they implement student-centered instructional practices; and (4) a research program focusing on how faculty develop from novices to reflective practitioners in their role as educators. Despite the successes of the New Faculty Workshops to date, studies show that some faculty members do not persist in implementing those pedagogical practices. The redesigned program will directly address this ""implementation dip"" by developing habits of mind that support resilience, reflection, and continuous improvement of teaching, and engaging faculty in an inclusive community of educators that helps them navigate and integrate student-centered teaching practices throughout their careers.  The research and evaluation are designed to inform the improvement of workshops and post-workshop activities and contribute to an understanding of the role of reflective practice in tackling the implementation gap associated with sustaining student centered pedagogical practice in undergraduate STEM education.  The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The increased vulnerability is driven by many factors including the rising complexity of systems and algorithms, the blurring of the line between computing and communication, and the introduction of new technologies such as Internet of Things (IoT) that introduce devices from a globalized supply chain, whose provenance and security may be difficult to verify or guarantee. This project investigates the emerging risks from malicious modifications in hardware or software of NextG wireless communication systems, and devises techniques that improve the resilience of the next generation of communication systems against these risks. Malicious modifications can find their way into a communication system via software or firmware updates, which are nowadays common. Malicious hardware modifications have also evolved into a credible threat, due to the stretching of the integrated circuit (IC) fabrication supply chain that creates many opportunities for vulnerabilities to be inserted into a communication IC from design to fabrication. The project?s broader significance and importance are the protection of NextG systems against cyber threats, electrical and computer engineering curriculum development, and K-12 outreach.<br/><br/>More specifically, this project concentrates on the modification threats that infiltrate the physical layer of wireless communication systems, inflicting harm by compromising data, or hampering legitimate communication via jamming and denial of service. New classes of modification threats in the physical layer are identified, and their threat is quantitatively analyzed. The research project further studies methods to detect the presence of malicious modifications, an important step for their removal or neutralization. The performance of these detection techniques is studied under adversarial uncertainty. The project demonstrates and verifies the attacks, as well as detection and mitigation strategies, via a custom-designed hardware platform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electrocatalytic processes can store electrical energy from renewable energy sources in the form of liquid or gaseous fuels from abundant, renewable feedstocks such as carbon dioxide or biomass. A principal hurdle for the adoption of this technology is the poor product selectivity of these reactions. These reactions are complex and occur at an interface involving a liquid (the electrolyte) and a solid (the electrode). In this work, the project team will modify this interface, and thus the electrocatalytic activity, by coating the electrodes with a special class of porous material known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The project team will use spectroscopy and advanced computer simulations to gain molecular-level insights into the effects of the MOF overlayers on three model reactions that are central for renewable fuel synthesis: The conversion of water to hydrogen, the conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, and conversion of biomass to valuable chemicals and fuels. The results of this research will provide insight into the control of selectivity of electrocatalytic reaction. Further, the team will engage in synergistic activities aimed at promoting the recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in STEM. Specifically, the team will involve female high-school students and underrepresented undergraduate minority students in this research as part of a summer program, which will expose the participants to state-of-the-art renewable energy research in the areas of synthesis, analytical chemistry, and simulation techniques.<br/><br/>On this project, Matthias Waegele and Junwei (Lucas) Bao of Boston College and Mariam Ismail of the University of Massachusetts, Boston are studying and designing 3D active sites at the metal electrode/porous 3D material interface to facilitate desirable reaction pathways of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes for energy storage and conversion. To this end, the team will coat metal electrodes (Pt and Au) with crystalline metal-organic framework (MOF) overlayers and investigate the effects of the MOF overlayers on PCET processes. Through systematic variation of the inorganic nodes and organic linkers of the MOFs, the team will aim to understand the effect of the MOF?s chemical and physical properties on PCET. The project will focus on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. Vibrational and Raman spectroscopies will be used to characterize the metal electrode/MOF interface under catalytic conditions. Key properties to be extracted from these measurements will include the interfacial pH, electric double layer charging, MOF-intermediate interactions, interfacial water structure, and local structure of the MOF at the metal surface. Computer simulations will map minimum-energy reaction pathways. On the basis of these investigations, the project aims to establish robust interfacial property-reactivity relationships. Such design rules would serve to guide the choice of synergistic 3D material, electrolyte, and reaction conditions to steer PCET reactions in aqueous electrolytes, and thereby also support the discovery of efficient and selective pathways for renewable fuels formation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Just as the discovery of semiconductors revolutionized computation and information storage, functional 2D materials and materials formed by vertically stacking 2D materials have the potential to revolutionize every aspect of our lives. They are actively being explored for both fundamental research and modern device applications, including efficient generation, storing, and transporting power across the national grid with minimal losses, ultrasensitive sensors capable of synchronous monitoring, and efficient disease detection and diagnosis. Critical to actualizing these novel and transformative technological applications is a fundamental understanding of the interplay between the exotic phases that abound in 2D materials.  Due to the complexity of electron-electron interactions coupled with materials' inhomogeneities, standard computational modeling approaches suitable for perfect bulk materials often become unreliable for modeling 2D materials. The PI and his team will develop and employ advanced theoretical and computational techniques that will account for strong electron-electron interaction and inhomogeneous nature of 2D materials to explore physical properties and phenomena that could potentially be harnessed for technological advances.<br/><br/>This award also supports various education and outreach activities.

To tackle the challenges of studying moderately correlated realistic 2D materials, the PI will develop and employ advanced numerical and theoretical techniques accounting for Coulomb interactions, random disorder, complete orbital structure, and the presence of dielectric screening within the material. Several open questions that have come into focus due to recent experimental discoveries in 2D-based quantum materials will be addressed, such as (1) What is the physical nature of the nanoscale phase coexistence between material?s imperfection, spatial correlations, and Coulomb interactions? (2) What is the fate of Coulomb and exciton interactions, and quantum criticality near broken symmetry states in the presence of material imperfection? (3) Can the defect-induced broken symmetry state, e.g., Mott physics and metal-insulator quantum transition be harnessed through band-engineering? The PI will exploit the potential to realize defect-induced transitions between the various broken-symmetry states.<br/><br/>This award also supports various education and outreach activities. The PI will (1) train both undergraduate and graduate students in computational physics, data science, and materials science research, (2) deliver corresponding interdisciplinary hands-on materials modeling courses by integrating research with teaching, and (3) perform educational outreach with the potential to enhance STEM education and increased public scientific awareness and literacy within the Lehigh Valley.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These robots are struggling to process growing volumes of rich sensory data and deploy compute-and-power hungry machine learning (ML) models. However, robots have an opportunity to augment their intelligence by querying remote compute resources over next-generation (NextG) wireless networks. However, researchers lack algorithms to balance the accuracy benefits of networked computation with systems costs of delay, power, congestion, and load on remote compute servers. As such, this project is innovating algorithms based on decision theory (i.e., a mathematical cost-benefit analysis) to decide how to balance on-robot and remote computation while only communicating task-relevant, privacy-preserving data. The resulting communication-efficient algorithms aim to improve the resiliency of NextG networks by minimizing congestion. The project?s outreach efforts aim to enable K-12 students to prototype on remote robots. <br/><br/>This project develops algorithms to enable joint inference, learning, and control between robotic swarms and the cloud while resiliently adapting to variations in network connectivity and compute availability. Today's robotic control algorithms are largely informed by onboard sensors and a local physical state, but effectively ignore the time-variant state of a network. As such, they often make sub-optimal decisions on when to query the cloud, often leading to excessive congestion. Accordingly, this project develops decision-theoretic algorithms that flexibly trade-off the accuracy benefits of the cloud with systems costs. First, the project develops collaborative inference algorithms that decide whether, and where, to offload computation using a Markov Decision Process. Then, it develops statistical data sampling algorithms that estimate the marginal gain of uploading new training data with labeling and training costs. The final thrust learns compressed representations of video and LiDAR that optimize for ML inference accuracy, as opposed to conventional human perception metrics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The success of current cellular systems is in large part due to the design of an efficient connection-based downlink for transferring data from the base station to the user equipment. This has been facilitated by the fact that we have not placed stringent demands on the quality of service. Indeed, design metrics have centered around peak/average downlink data rates and aggregate data throughput rather than on strong statistical guarantees for individual users or resiliency. Two factors are likely to upend the status quo in the design philosophy of wireless systems: the changing profile of traffic and the focus on resilience rather than on average performance measures. Growth in wireless traffic will come from distributed content creators, a massive number of unattended machines enabling distributed learning, mobile robots, and video monitoring devices. These devices will demand a substantially robust and efficient uplink from the user equipment to the base station. In addition, these devices tend to generate a rich diversity of traffic profiles and demand profiles, thereby creating the need for adaptable and resilient infrastructures. With this in mind, this project addresses the need to optimize and improve the robustness of uplink wireless access for heterogeneous devices. From a broad perspective, the project seeks to strengthen wireless network infrastructure. It provides opportunities for collaboration with industry for technology transfer to wireless standards. Concurrently, the project seeks to create educational materials that contribute to the training of a globally competitive science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce and offers skill-development opportunities to practitioners in the wireless industry.<br/><br/>From a technical viewpoint, the project considers the paradigm of cell-free multiple input multiple output (MIMO) systems with distributed signal processing as a solution to improve resiliency of cellular systems. It explores unsourced multiple access as a means to reduce coordination at the physical and medium access control layers, thereby enabling the operation of an efficient uplink within the cell-free paradigm. It seeks innovative solutions to several key problems that must be addressed in order to design a robust uplink based on cell-free unsourced random access with multiple transmit and receive antennas, especially to enable distributed learning. The problems tackled in this project can be grouped into three interrelated categories: (i) the design of codes and receiver signal processing algorithms for uncoordinated, non-orthogonal multiple access in cell-free MIMO systems; (ii) the design of novel joint compression, coding and multiple access algorithms for federated learning and edge computing; and (iii) the joint design of radio-frequency (RF) front ends and baseband signal processing for mitigating non-linearities that result from multiband receivers that are emblematic of future devices. The proposed solution methodologies are based on promising recent results leveraging connections between multiple access and sparse recovery, over the air federated learning, new RF front end designs based on machine learning, and combining model-based signal processing and machine learning. Some aspects of the solution methodologies are also based on classical and highly-effective results in multi-terminal information theory and rateless codes, but used in the context of distributed learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This fellowship to Dr. Stackhouse supports his research entitled ?MPS-Ascend: Critical Metals from Complex Waste Streams: An Electrochemical Roadmap to Selective Extraction?, under the mentorship of sponsoring senior scientists. The host institution for the fellowship is Texas A&M University, and the sponsoring scientists are Dr. Sarbajit Banerjee and Dr. Karen Wooley.<br/><br/>With this fellowship, Dr. Stackhouse investigates new methods to advance the recovery of rare-earth elements (REEs) from waste streams using energy efficient and electrochemical processes to selectively recover rare-earth elements in high purity from complex waste streams. REEs are crucial elements to technologies important to the energy transition, manufacturing competitiveness, and national security. Current industrial recycling efforts are impeded by the limited amount of REE obtained, lack of commercial recycling technologies suitable for the recovery of the small amount of REEs present in the evolving complex mixture of metal within consumer products, and low metal value per unit, which makes dependence upon primary sources more cost-effective. These issues compound national reliance on foreign natural resources. This project exploits the unique properties of a class of salts known as ionic liquids (ILs) for a targeted recovery of rare-earth metals from commercial waste streams (e.g., permanent magnets, computing devices, etc.). With the help of advanced characterization tools, such as cutting-edge synchrotron X-ray spectroscopy techniques, the researcher advances the collective knowledge of this research community, by elucidating a detailed mechanistic understanding of rare-earth solvation, and the developing fundamental electrochemical and chemical design principles that offer new routes to obtain rare earth metal from waste streams. In addition to societal broader impacts, exemplified by mitigating the environmental impact of REEs in waste streams as well as the reliance upon foreign sources of REEs, Dr. Stackhouse actively broadens participation of underrepresented minorities in STEM with this fellowship.

Polymer nanocomposites display unique physical properties that have rendered them a platform for innovative material technologies in areas such as energy storage and generation, transportation or biomedical. The realization of these technologies is contingent on the ability to control the material?s structure and, thus, its properties. This is hindered by the current lack of understanding of the interactions between the polymer and nanomaterial constituents and their effect on material behavior. The goal of this project is to develop novel methods to control the interactions between polymer and nanomaterial constituents and to harness these interactions to enable polymer nanocomposite materials in which structure and properties can be deliberately controlled to optimize performance. This will promote the development of scalable and economic fabrication processes for materials with improved properties. The program will support the teaching of two new courses on polymer science and engineering and provide training for one graduate student and several undergraduate student researchers. Collaborations with educators at minority serving institutions will be leveraged to support the participation of minority students.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL ABSTRACT<br/><br/>The modification of particle surfaces with polymer chains facilitates control of the interactions and assembly behavior of nanoparticle-based materials. The resulting brush particles have thus emerged as model systems to elucidate the physics of materials that are intermediate between the classical ?colloidal hard sphere? and ?polymer coil? limit and as a platform for the development of functional materials in areas such as self-healing, shape memory, high-k dielectrics, or thermoplastic elastomers. This research project will develop fundamental understanding of the conditions that enable polymer ligands to induce polymer-like phase behavior in (nano)particulate materials. The research will test the hypothesis that the constraining effect of the slow particle diffusion gives rise to the splitting of domain growth kinetics into two regimes: an early ?anomalous? regime dominated by the dynamics of grafted chains and a subsequent ?regular? growth regime that is governed by particle diffusion. The research plan is organized into three research thrusts that focus on the synthesis of brush particle model systems with systematically varied particle size, degree of polymerization, and density of grafted chains; the characterization of structure evolution of LCST brush particle blend systems in the thin film state as a function of molecular architecture, composition, quench depth and annealing time; and the elucidation of structure evolution of brush particle blend systems in the bulk state using X-ray and neutron scattering analysis. The program provides cross-disciplinary training for one graduate and several undergraduate students in the critical areas of polymer and nanoscale materials as well as self-assembly processes. Collaboration with researchers at minority serving institutions will promote the participation of minority students and underrepresented groups. The program will support the teaching of two new courses on polymer science and engineering as well as a summer course that is offered to high school students visiting Carnegie Mellon University as part of its AP/EA program.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous studies in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica suggest that viral infections of microbes, and a general lack of fertilizers (i.e., nutrients), may be important factors shaping the development and functioning of microbial communities in cryoconite holes.  The researchers propose an experimental approach to understand how nutrient limitation affects diversity (number of species) and overall abundance of microbes, and how the diversity and abundance of microbes in turn affects the diversity, abundance, and infection type of viruses that parasitize the microbes in cryoconite sediments.  The researchers will use sediments previously collected from Antarctic glaciers that have varying concentrations of viruses and nutrients, to set up a nutrient-addition experiment to determine how nutrients affect microbial and viral population dynamics. The results will deepen our understanding of how microbial communities in general are shaped by nutrients and viruses and give new insights into the functioning of viruses in extremely cold environments. The researchers will publish their findings in scientific journals and will share their discoveries with K-12 students from rural schools in collaboration with the Pinhead Institute and will connect undergraduate students from under-represented minorities to polar research through participation in the university?s Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics Routes Uplift Research Program. Outreach will be achieved through videos produced and distributed by a professional science communicator. The research advances a National Science Foundation goal of expanding fundamental knowledge of Antarctic systems, biota, and processes by utilizing the unique characteristics of the Antarctic region as a science observing platform. <br/><br/>The Principal Investigators propose an experimental approach to understand how nutrient limitation affects microbial diversity and abundances and their cascading effects on virus diversity, abundance, and mode of infection (lysis vs. lysogeny) in Antarctic cryoconite holes. Cryoconite holes are ideal natural microcosms for manipulative studies, not available in other cryospheric ecosystems.  The PIs will use previously collected cryoconite from across a gradient of both viral diversity and nutrient levels to address questions about key limiting nutrients and microbial-viral community dynamics in cryoconite sediments. Nutrient manipulation experiments will be conducted in a growth chamber that closely approximates the light and temperature regime of in situ cryoconite holes to test three core hypotheses: (1) phosphorus availability limits microbial productivity and abundance in cryoconite holes; (2) relaxing nutrient limitation in cryoconite from low-diversity glaciers will increase species diversity, leading microbial communities to resemble those found on more nutrient-rich glaciers; (3) relaxing nutrient limitation will increase the diversity and abundance of viruses by increasing the availability of suitable hosts, and decrease the prevalence of lysogenic infections.  By manipulating nutrient limitation within a realistic range, this project will help verify hypothesized phosphorus limitation of Antarctic cryoconite holes and will extend understanding of the connections between nutrients, diversity, and viral infection dynamics in the cryosphere more generally. A better understanding of these dynamics in cryoconite sediments improves the ability of scientists to forecast future impacts of environmental changes in the cryosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In structured environments such as highways and warehouses, robots can navigate by following lane markings or pre-defined paths. However, in unstructured environments, such as construction, agriculture, rural delivery and disaster sites, robots need to have a deeper understanding of the surrounding objects and terrain in order to navigate safely. Unfortunately, most mobile robot systems deployed for navigation and exploration use their sensors to mainly gather geometric information such as the shape and location of the obstacles and other objects in the environment. Richer information is needed, such as type of terrains and how difficult they will be to traversed, to facilitate navigation and exploration. To address this fundamental research gap, this project aims to investigate a semantically-aware framework for field robots that complements the geometric information with semantic information about terrain properties in order to improve the navigation and exploration capabilities of robots. This research represents an important step towards achieving robots with advanced artificial intelligence capabilities that can operate well in unstructured construction, mining, or agriculture environments. In particular, removing barriers of entry for automation technology in these traditionally labor-intensive industries is vital towards increased economic competitiveness of these industries in workplaces of the future.<br/><br/>This research will revisit the potential field navigation method using deep learning-based 3D semantic reasoning tools paired with self-supervised learning from motion feedback to provide a fresh perspective on active perception for robots. The semantic navigation method contains three main components: (i) a semantic vector field prediction network to map raw sensor data to semantic features and map semantic features to navigation signals; (ii) a pre-training scheme that transfers prior knowledge from an observation database and expert demonstrations to the navigation system; and (iii) a semantically-guided exploration scheme to enable the robot to take calculated risks while gathering information about the surroundings. The method will initially be evaluated on the physics-based MSU Autonomous Vehicle Simulator (MAVS) which has the capability of simulating robot operation under challenging terrain and weather. Finally, field experiments will be conducted at the one-of-a-kind off-road proving ground at Mississippi State University.<br/><br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).

Indeed, CI performance is essential in all technology fields from research and design to manufacturing.   Given the importance of CI, as well as its substantial cost, it is important that all stakeholders, i.e., the public, end-users, system support personnel, application developers and decision makers, have at their disposal tools to help optimize and measure CI performance, as well as the applications that use it.<br/><br/>The University at Buffalo is developing CI measurement and optimization tools, namely XDMoD (XD Metrics on Demand) and its open-source counterpart, Open XDMoD, which are in use worldwide for advanced CI monitoring and reporting in academia and industry.  This project builds upon and expands this foundation for measuring and monitoring services for the large NSF investment in the Advanced Cyberinfrastructure Coordination Ecosystem: Services & Support program. <br/><br/>Highlights of this project include: (1) development of a flexible framework that allows stakeholders to use analytical tools they desire on performance data from national and local CI resources; (2) development of a comprehensive view of the CI ecosystem, including network, data, and public clouds, to facilitate CI planning from the local to the national level; (3) development of a CI simulator to predict the response of the CI ecosystem to proposed new systems or changes in existing  systems enabling efficient deployment and use; and (4) development of automated tools to monitor application performance metrics (including energy) on established and novel CI architectures. The relationship between time-to-solution versus energy consumed is important to determine the feasibility of adopting novel CI architectures which promise lower energy consumption.<br/><br/>Open XDMoD has a broad impact through its use by institutions worldwide to better manage their CI assets, including academic, industrial, and governmental research centers.

Interactive spoken language systems offer the possibility of a powerful tool for assisting in early childhood education, freeing up teachers? time, and engaging students in repeated opportunities for learning. These systems involve both Automatic Speech Recognition and Text-to-Speech Systems. The goal of this research is to improve the performance of such systems for young speakers of African American English (AAE) such that automated oral literacy assessment can be developed. The research has important societal and technological impacts. It will enhance the usability of speech technology in early education for AAE speaking children, providing a model for better supporting students with diverse dialects.

The work has strong outreach and dissemination programs and will train undergraduate and graduate students in interdisciplinary research in Electrical and Computer Engineering, Linguistics, Education, and Psychology.<br/><br/> <br/>Challenges facing children?s Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) are due to (1) lack of child speech data and, hence, current models used for recognition are trained using data collected from adult speakers, and (2) children display a wider range of intra- and inter- speaker variability than adults.  ASR performance is especially poor for children who are non-native English speakers or those who at times transition into dialects such as AAE that are different from what ASR systems are typically trained on.  In addition, most dialog systems built on text-to-speech (TTS) technology are designed using General American English (GAE) voices, which minority children may not identify with. In the high-stakes area of education, these considerations impact the effectiveness of technology for different groups.

On the learning side, the research will highlight the impact of dialect on literacy assessment. On the technology side, the work will yield novel machine learning algorithms for low-resource tasks.  Specifically, this project will develop data augmentation techniques that can increase the amount of training data available for low-resource tasks, and data normalization techniques so that ASR performance is improved for AAE child speakers. The work on TTS will explore new methods of disentangling speaker and dialect impacts on spectral realization of phrases that model dialect density (rather than treating dialect as a categorical variable) and separately accounting for pronunciation and prosodic factors.

These methods allow scientists to understand earthquake hazards, to measure stability of the ground underneath structures, to monitor groundwater systems, to study changes in threatened Earth systems such as glaciers and permafrost, to safely and efficiently explore natural resources underground, and to monitor civil infrastructure health, among other applications. Seismology has undergone a radical shift recently; new sensor technologies have made data collection much easier, enabling hundreds to thousands of times larger datasets that can be used for detailed studies of larger regions for long periods of time. Most scientists cannot use these data because: (1) data are only shared internally among groups that have new sensors, (2) public seismology data storage facilities cannot support such large data quantities, and (3) most geoscientists do not have the computational resources to analyze the data. Because of these three issues, there is an inequitable research environment, much data remains unexplored, and important geoscience discoveries cannot occur. While there are ongoing efforts to address the first issue, without major cyberinfrastructure advances addressing the second and third issues newly acquired data is unlikely to be fully analyzed. This project aims to create new computational algorithms, software and models of open data sharing to ensure that any geoscientist can glean valuable insights from large-scale seismology data. The education and outreach program will create opportunities for more people to participate in mathematical modeling and large-scale data analysis for science and engineering applications. The project PI will develop and strengthen existing efforts to support diverse and inclusive research and learning environments. She will continue to develop a program to introduce women undergraduates to mathematics research, growing it to be a sustainable multi-faculty course serving more students from underrepresented groups. The project will increase the impact of the annual data science conference led by the  PI. The conference features research by women data scientists and tutorials on modern data science techniques, and connects the interdisciplinary data science community on a rural campus.<br/><br/>The project will derive and analyze new geoscience algorithms, develop community software and explore models of open data distribution. The project goal is to ensure that any seismologist can gain valuable geophysical insights from extreme-scale seismic data in the field, at institutions with limited computing resources, and on modern high performance computing (HPC) systems. Expertise in large-scale seismic sensing, mathematics, high-throughput computational science, and algorithm design are necessary to achieve these advances. The project proposes a new model for public seismology data archives that allows for the storage of lossy-compressed data and data products, thus creating a new capacity to host ultra-high-density and large-scale seismic data, without displacing existing systems for high-quality seismometer data. To address large-scale data analysis, the PI has previously created several scalable algorithms, and theoretical analyses suggest that a complete suite of scalable, parallelizable algorithms for multiple types of passive seismic data processing can be developed. Many of the algorithms operate directly on compressed information without reconstructing the original data, which reduces costly data movement. The project will develop fast serial and parallel software algorithm implementations, and investigate the use of accelerator hardware for high computational efficiency. For each algorithm the project will theoretically derive and  computationally verify trends governing tradeoffs between computational efficiency, memory footprint, and end-to-end accuracy specific to the geophysical analyses. The algorithms will incorporate error bounds for realistic non-idealized data and will be included in predictive software for geoscientists to make informed decisions prior to requests for compressed data or data products. The new methods will be tested by applying them to cutting-edge passive seismic data at the scale of tens to hundreds of terabytes. The data will enable seismology analyses in for urban  hydrology and geotechnical engineering, and also analyses to aid in understanding glacier movements to improve climate models via improved boundary conditions and mechanistic understanding.  In addition to earthquake seismology, hydrology, geotechnical engineering, and cryosphere studies, the methods developed can be applied to many high-throughput computational science problems utilizing sparse or compressed representations (e.g., structural health monitoring, imaging science, solar physics, radioastronomy, wireless communications, industrial facility monitoring).

With the use of this material, the average life span of our nation?s transportation infrastructure may be significantly extended. UHPC has potential value because it is designed with superior mechanical strength, ductility, post-cracking behavior, and longer-term durability. UHPC may be used in applications for prefabricated bridge elements, pile cap closure pores, bridge deck overlays and repairs, and as a grout for bridge shear keys. In addition, the UHPC formulation may be produced on the job site by local contractors using local materials that will meet both state departments of transportation and federal highway administration specifications.<br/> <br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of ultra-high-performance concrete (UHPC) using local materials and industrial by-products such as coal ash, steel slag, and limestone powder. This material has been shown to exhibit superior mechanical strength and longer-term durability. UHPC?s use in the United States may be limited due to its high cost. The cost of UHPC may be reduced, and its durability and sustainability improved, by using local materials reducing cement, silica fume, steel fiber, and fine sand contents. Cement and silica fume contents may be reduced by using fly ash and ground granulated blast furnace slag (GGBS) as supplementary cementitious materials (SCMs). The use of these SCMs reduces the cost and results in eco-efficient UHPC. The laboratory results obtained so far indicate that the proposed material is comparable with currently available products in terms of compressive and tensile strengths and durability properties: resistance to rapid freeze-thaw cycles, resistance to chloride ion penetration, and resistance to sulfate attack. The rapid chloride ion permeability testing results showed that the proposed UHPC has negligible chloride ion ingress, while the material exhibited excellent resistance to rapid freeze-thaw cycles and sulfate attack.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Rice is a food staple for more than 3 billion people around the globe. Rice diseases affect rice production worldwide, and as a result, represent a significant threat to global food security. Among rice diseases, Bacterial Panicle Blight, caused by the pathogen Burkholderia glumae, is particularly problematic as there are not effective methods to control it. The deployment of this technology may reduce yield loss to farmers due to this disease, while also reducing the costs associated with the purchase and use of antibacterial chemicals that are not effective. This technology may benefit rice farmers in the United States and across the world. Although this project focuses on a specific bacterial disease in rice, it is possible that its impact can be expanded to other crop diseases.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an environmentally-friendly and effective seed coating treatment to control Bacterial Panicle Blight (BPB). Plant diseases caused by microorganisms such as fungi and bacteria significantly affect agricultural productivity. Traditionally, fungal plant diseases have been controlled by synthetic fungicides that while effective, pose significant threat to the environment. In contrast to fungal diseases, effective methods to control bacterial diseases in crops are unavailable, mostly because the use of synthetic antibiotics in crops can increase the likelihood that antibiotic resistance can be transmitted to human bacterial pathogens. There is a critical need to find antibacterials effective against plant diseases without detrimental effects to human health or the environment. Bacterial Panicle Blight (BPB) has significantly decreased rice production worldwide. The proposed technology is based on the secreted fraction of the environmental bacterium Pseudomonas protegens strain PBL3. Because the P. protegens PBL3 secreted fraction contains a mixture of molecules with diverse modes of action, the likelihood that bacteria develop resistance is very small. This technology has the potential to provide an effective, long-lasting, environmentally-friendly and consumer-accepted method of reducing BPB in rice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This last-mile infrastructure is essential in ensuring that users enjoy high-quality access to Internet services. It is thus important that the last-mile infrastructure is highly available, protects user privacy, offers high performance, and yet is cost-efficient with a healthy ecosystem of innovative last-mile vendors. Unfortunately, today?s last-mile ecosystem ? and the cellular ecosystem in particular ? falls short on all of these dimensions. The goal of this project is to take initial steps toward transforming how our communication systems interact with the last mile. If successful, the resulting infrastructure would be more available, and the ecosystem would be incentivized to provide cost-effective and high-quality connectivity to all.<br/><br/>The current last-mile ecosystem closely couples the usage of (scarce) access resources to whatever backend provider the user has contracted with. For example, today?s cellular architecture limits users to the facilities associated (directly or indirectly) with their mobile network operator This coupling limits resilience (i.e., surviving failures of individual access points or providers) as well as efficiency (since last-mile costs cannot be shared across operators). The latter in turn discourage deployment in rural areas and hence constrains the reach of network services. To improve both the resilience and efficiency of our cellular networks, this project explores a new access architecture that decouples last-mile resources from a user's choice of mobile operator. This enables users to make use of all available access resources, providing far greater protection from last-mile failures and making more markets financially viable. Realizing this decoupling requires three main areas of technical innovation. First, to achieve the desired decoupling, mobility should be handled outside the cellular core while preserving performance and feature parity with today's cellular networks. Second, recent developments have shown how current cellular protocols do not provide adequate levels of privacy. The decoupling of the last mile from the backend must be done in a way that not only matches but instead greatly exceeds the current privacy protections. Third, to allow users to seamlessly switch between cellular and Wi-Fi access, there must be a uniform way to authenticate users, and this approach should not require hardware or firmware changes to the underlying technologies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Professor Xu is developing new, more sustainable methods for converting readily available hydrocarbons into more valuable molecules that contain one or more nitrogen atoms. A large number of small-molecule pharmaceuticals and functional materials contain nitrogen atoms, a situation that makes the chemistry being developed both timely and important for addressing modern synthetic needs. The chemistry is also more sustainable that the current state-of-the-art methods because the reagents used by Professor Xu and his students are derived from iron - the second most abundant metal in the Earth's crust - and stable, common peroxides. These simple reagents replace the much more rare and expensive reagents typically used for the current methods. The research program lies at the interface of organic, inorganic, and mechanistic chemistry; therefore, it provides a unique education opportunity for all levels of young scientists. This opportunity is especially important because of the large number of minority students who attend Georgia State University and Professor Xu's strong commitment to working with those students.<br/> <br/>This research program aims to develop and study novel synthetic approaches that harness stable peroxides to selectively functionalize a broad range of olefins with non-oxygen-based groups. In the first phase of this project, Professor Xu and his students are exploring the reactivity of unique iron complexes with stable peroxides and developing an iron-catalyzed method for selective olefin diazidation/diamination reactions. The work is expanding the development of iron-catalyzed process for a broad range of olefins and N-heterocycles. In the second phase of this project, the group is exploring new iron-catalyzed activation approaches for fluoroalkyl transfer reactions. The work is providing a general and selective approach for olefin functionalization that will likely become a useful tool for organic chemists.

Future viability of these clean energy technologies are dependent on Li-ion battery technology.

When these ""solar energetic particles"" (SEPs) interact with the Earth, they are a potential space weather hazard. They can have adverse impacts on avionics, satellites, and astronauts. Forecasting SEP events is a challenge because they are unpredictable and the particles can arrive at Earth within minutes to hours of the solar event. To mitigate the harmful effects due to SEPs on our technology-dependent society, we need a thorough understanding of how such energetic particles are transported and accelerated in the solar system, particularly in near-Earth space. Due to the nature and scale of the problem, such an understanding requires collaborative efforts from researchers in multiple disciplines, including solar physics, space physics and geospace sciences, plasma physics and particle physics. In this project, a multidisciplinary team from the University of Alabama in Huntsville (UAH), University of Michigan (UM), University of Wisconsin at River Falls, and the National Solar Observatory will develop a comprehensive scientific model to understand and forecast SEPs.  They will create a web-based SEP forecasting tool hosted by UAH and UM for use by the space weather community. University students and a postdoctoral researcher will have leadership roles in all aspects of the project. The broader impacts of this cutting-edge research effort are thus in its potential to improve societal resilience to a space weather hazard while advancing our nation's expertise in space science and space weather. <br/><br/>This project will develop a comprehensive scientific model to understand and predict how CMEs influence the energetic particle radiation environment in the inner solar system and Earth's magnetosphere, and compare the results with measurements at the Earth's surface. Two widely used models, the Space Weather Modeling Framework (SWMF) and the improved Particle Acceleration and Transport in the Heliosphere model (iPATH) will be coupled. Existing gaps in SWMF and iPATH will be bridged by developing two new models: a machine learning-assisted CME model for the lower solar corona, and a particle tracing model for transport from the Lagrange L1 point into the magnetosphere. The integrated model will provide the ability to simulate the propagation of SEPs from CME launch to signals detected by ground-based neutron monitors, and account for effects on galactic cosmic rays, e.g., the Forbush decrease. Model validation will include comparison with neutron monitor data for a number of ground level enhancements and large SEP events during solar cycles 23 and 24. An integrated SEP/GCR Forecasting Tool will be made openly accessible to the space weather community through a web interface. Daily forecast of the SEP/GCR flux at the L1 point and inside the magnetosphere, as well as neutron monitor flux (when applicable) will be provided at 8-hour intervals. Given the increased interest in Sun-Earth system science, a graduate level course on magnetospheric physics will be developed at UAH. Undergraduate and graduate students and early-career researchers including a postdoctoral scholar will be fully involved in the research and outreach efforts. ANSWERS projects will advance the nation?s STEM expertise and societal resilience to space weather hazards by filling key knowledge gaps regarding the coupled Sun-Earth system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous research has identified substantial reorganization of labor, development of new technologies, and punctuated increases in lethal conflict within Chumash society during the Medieval Climatic Anomaly (MCA), a period of episodic droughts and fluctuating sea-surface temperatures (SST). Very little is known about Chumash social organization and marital patterns prior to Spanish contact, and archaeology is well-suited to reclaiming this knowledge. This research will identify kinship patterns in Chumash society during the MCA by using an innovative combination of archaeogenomic (ancient DNA) and archaeometric (strontium, carbon, and nitrogen isotopes) analysis of ancient Chumash burials. Minimally invasive small tissue samples were taken from ancestral remains under the supervision of the Barbareo Band of Chumash Indians. Resulting data will be contextualized with climatic records for the region and will enhance our understanding of how environmental change affected human social organization over the past two thousand years. This research will substantially aide archaeologists in understanding nuanced ways in which society changes in the context of climate change. The researcher?s indigenous Chumash heritage provides a unique opportunity for this research to positively impact both the Native American and scientific communities. Goals of the proposed research include introducing a diverse array of Native American perspectives within archaeology and development of pedagogical methods to help integrate archaeological research within tribal communities as a form of historical knowledge. Integrating ancient DNA and isotopic method within indigenous archaeological practice serves as a foundation for transformational change between indigenous and academic communities while stimulating important discourse surrounding the future of minimally destructive analysis of indigenous remains in North America. <br/><br/>The project will evaluate and add to models broadly focused on how humans respond to short and long-term environmental change and how these changes affect human social organization. This research takes place on the Northern Channel Islands and the adjacent Santa Barbara coastline, areas that have been continuously occupied by the Chumash people. Significant changes in Chumashan society co-occurred with a series of episodic droughts known collectively as the Medieval Climatic Anomaly. This study will couple genome-wide sequencing with stable isotope data from Chumash burials and compare these data to regional climate records to reconstruct changing familial relationships and social structure through time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, the creation of trimmings and embellishments such as buttons and sequins for the fashion industry is done using petroleum-based plastics. These embellishments are not biodegradable, making up for a sizable portion of the 14 million tons of waste produced annually by the apparel industry. The proposed technology uses plant-based plastics and small order minimums to partner with designers that are looking for customizable and biodegradable alternatives. Plant-based plastics are expected to degrade naturally in the environment once placed in the landfill at a minimal environmental cost. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of biodegradable and industrially compostable trimmings and embellishments for the apparel industry. The proposed trimmings will be made from sustainable plant-based biodegradable polymer with a variety of fashion features such as brightness, texture, and shape.  In addition, using computer numerical control (CNC) technology such as computer-aided design, laser cutting, and 3D printing, these products may be created with minimal waste without sacrificing quality. Also, the proposed technology will make use of natural pigments such as hemp, coffee, and algae, which may contribute to sustainability. Unlike trimmings and embellishments made from petroleum-based plastics, these products are expected to cause little harm to the environment when eventually discarded. While chemical dyes commonly found in plastic trimmings and embellishments have been found to be harmful to the environment, the proposed natural pigments are not expected to cause damage during the biodegradation process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preliminary studies indicate that groundwater may supply both dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and iron in this region. In coastal ecosystems like the West Florida Shelf that have very low nitrate and ammonium concentrations, DON is the main form of nitrogen available to organisms. Nitrogen cycling is strongly affected by iron availability because iron is essential for both photosynthesis and for nitrogen fixation. This study will investigate the sources and composition of DON and iron, and their influence on the coastal ecosystem. The team will sample offshore groundwater wells, river and estuarine waters, and conduct two expeditions across the West Florida Shelf in winter and summer. Investigators will participate in K-12 and outreach activities to increase awareness of the project and related science. The project will fund the work of six graduate and eight undergraduate students across five institutions, furthering NSF?s goals of education and training. <br/><br/>Motivated by preliminary observations of unexplained, tightly-correlated DON and dissolved iron concentrations across the West Florida Shelf (WFS), the proposed work will quantify the flux and isotopic signatures of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD)-derived DON and iron to the WFS, and evaluate the bioavailability of this temporally-variable source using four seasonal near-shore campaigns sampling offshore groundwater wells, estuarine, and riverine endmembers and two cross-shelf cruises. The work will evaluate whether SGD stimulates nitrogen fixation on the WFS, and the potential for the stimulated nitrogen fixation to further modify the chemistry of DON and dissolved iron in the region. The cross-shelf cruises will investigate hypothesized periods of maximum SGD and Trichodesmium abundance (June), and reduced river discharge and SGD (February), thus comparing two distinct biogeochemical regimes. The concentrations and isotopic compositions of DON and dissolved iron, molecular composition of DON, and the concentration and composition of iron-binding ligands will be characterized. Nitrogen fixation rates and Trichodesmium spp. abundance and expression of iron stress genes will be measured. Fluxes of DON and iron from SGD and rivers will be quantified with radium isotope mass balances. The impacts of SGD on nitrogen fixation and DON/ligand production will be constrained with incubations of natural phytoplankton communities with submarine groundwater amendments. Two hypotheses will be tested: 1) SGD is the dominant source of bioavailable DON and dissolved iron on the WFS, and 2) SGD-alleviation of iron stress changes the dominant Trichodesmium species on the WFS, increases nitrogen fixation rates and modifies DON and iron composition. Overall, the work will establish connections between marine nitrogen and iron cycling and evaluate the potential for coastal inputs to modify water along the WFS before export to the Atlantic Ocean. This study will thus provide a framework to consider these boundary fluxes in oligotrophic coastal systems and the relative importance of rivers and SGD as sources of nitrogen and iron in other analogous locations, such as coastal systems in Australia, India, and Africa, where nitrogen fixation and SGD have also been documented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This presents a dramatic departure from current development practices. With this new breed of applications on the horizon, the security, performance, and feature requirements of the underlying execution platform grow commensurately. Second, the harsh reality of unexpected network failures at the edge forces every mainstream developer to become a distributed systems engineer. Distributed systems engineering multiplies complexity and difficulty manyfold, as partial failure (unavailability of one or more services) can adversely impact the system in unknown or hard-to-predict ways, even leading to catastrophic cascading failures. This research proposes an approach to full-stack ?resilience engineering? to enable secure, effective, and performant edge computation in NextG systems. Our work focuses on and builds on WebAssembly, which is emerging as the common underlying language-agnostic execution platform in new edge computing environments. We propose a robust, performant, and secure experimental runtime engine with support for instrumentation and rapid prototyping that will facilitate fault injection and program repair. On top of this foundation, this work proposes a set of tools for programming language-agnostic fault injection, testing, and repair of resilience (distributed system-related) errors in distributed and networked systems. This would allow software developers to quickly and effectively test and fix resilience defects before application code is deployed to users, rather than simply deploying and hoping for the best without any indication of how that application behaves in the face of partial failure (which is the current state of the art). If widely adopted, the results of this work would, in turn, reduce the occurrence of catastrophic cascading failures that cause widespread outages in critical networked services.<br/><br/>Essentially all software that we use as a society is now networked, meaning apps connect to multiple servers and coordinate together to complete a task (such as online banking, searching for nearby restaurants, and even streaming media). This project directly supports the development of dependable networked services. Prior to this research, apps are typically released to users without testing for issues at the network level between services. This work develops new ways to test this brave new world of networked software, making it possible for software developers to automatically discover and automatically repair bugs before that software is released to users. As a result of this research, we will have new tools that, if broadly used, can result in fewer outages of critical networked services that society depends on.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project draws from theoretical work across the humanities and even outside of the academy to change the way we think about knowledge about our living worlds. Currently biology education continues to rely on memorization of biological facts. Those facts are often simplified and narrowly developed in one discipline. By integrating knowledge from current science and technology literature into biology curriculum, undergraduate students will learn additional skills for engaging in science and research throughout their lives. The developed curriculum aims to shift how all people think about their competence and ethical responsibility to understand and fully participate in science. This study therefore has the potential to impact who becomes interested and invested in biology by using participatory ways of learning. This pedagogical intervention will contribute to the benefits of science to be more evenly distributed throughout society. The project outcomes will be of interest to policy makers, educators, parents and students. <br/><br/>The project is broken into three parts. The first part provides the basis and rationale for the project by analyzing current biology textbooks identifying points for intervention. Part two of the project culls research on the subject matter of biology, bodies and environments, from interdisciplinary academic and non-academic sources that are typically underrepresented in biology education. The final part of the project integrates these knowledges into education modules to be tested in classes and public forums. To realize its potential and allow for future expansion to K-12 and larger segments of the public, the results will be made broadly accessible to educators and laypersons through open access.

Each year, more than 50,000 scientific papers use DFT to predict the properties of molecules and solids, and to design new pharmaceutical drugs and materials.  About 1/3 of US supercomputer use is devoted to this task.  But such calculations are limited due to poor performance of approximations.   The aim of this work is to develop a new mathematical framework that has the promise of breakthroughs in both accuracy and speed of DFT calculations. Improvements in speed or accuracy of DFT calculations on the scale of this proposal would transform both the nature and capabilities of most DFT applications. Contrbuting to education and outreach, graduate and undergraduate students involved in this project will be trained to acquire high level knowledge of DFT, in a diverse and multi-national research group. A self-guided online course in Machine Learning in the Physical Sciences, developed by the Burke group and already available to all UC-Irvine students and faculty, will be made available to the public.<br/><br/>This proposal combines semiclassical methods (expansions in powers of h, Planck's constant), density-corrected DFT for separating energy errors from density-driven errors, and machine learning for finding approximate functionals from data. The aim is to go from proof-of-principle to approximate density functionals that can be applied to routine calculations. If successful, the research being undertaken under this award has the potential (a) to transform the basic starting point (generalized gradient approximations) of all DFT calculations into a new form; (b) to unite the functionals used in materials with those in chemistry; (c) to produce chemical accuracy for strong bonds at equilibrium, and (d) to apply to the non-interacting kinetic energy, and so impact orbital-free DFT.

The spectrum can also support wireless backhaul links to bridge the last mile connectivity, and provide broadband wireless access---the importance of which is clearly highlighted during the Covid-19 pandemic.

The proposed concept of smart reflecting surfaces aims to enable dynamic and on-demand control of wireless channels to create favorable transmission allowing robust wireless connectivity in mobile mmWave WLANs. The success of this project can enable the next-generation, ubiquitous, and low-cost mmWave wireless access, including flexible deployment of wireless backhauls addressing the last-mile connectivity, satellite communication, and intelligent wireless sensing systems for smart cities and cyber-physical systems.

Recent studies show that a large number of recovered patients (even those with initially mild or no symptoms) will have prolonged post-COVID complications (long COVID). Many types of biomarker molecules in our body are reported to be closely linked to these post-COVID conditions. As the current COVID-19 pandemic remains uncontrolled around the world, there is a pressing need for developing wearable sensors to monitor an individual?s health status at home. Most of the medical examinations are currently based on blood tests that require invasive blood draws and physical clinic visits. Human sweat contains a wealth of chemicals including that can reflect the body?s physiological state. Compared with blood tests, sweat analyses could serve as a non-invasive and more attractive candidate for continuous health monitoring in daily life. Wearable sweat sensors could allow personalized monitoring of long-COVID-related biomarkers in people?s daily activities. Such technology could help people better understand post-COVID conditions and how to treat the patients with these longer-term effects.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop a wearable biosensor platform that can efficiently extract and sample sweat across activities, and perform in situ, non-invasive molecular analysis of a broad spectrum of biomarkers toward personalized molecular monitoring of long COVID. This project will address multiple research challenges in the wearable sensor field.  Firstly, to enable wearable monitoring of a variety of trace-level sweat biomarkers related to long COVID, a unique wearable molecular sensing strategy will be developed based on artificial bioreceptors. This biosensing approach will be optimized with both computational and experimental approaches. Secondly, considering that current wearable sweat sensors mostly rely on exercise to access sweat and are not suitable for daily at-home uses or for sedentary individuals, this project will develop the fully integrated microfluidic wearable system for autonomous sweat induction, efficient sweat sampling, and in situ multiplexed analysis across activities. Lastly, in vivo evaluation of the wearable senor will be performed in patients with long COVID for retrospective and prospective monitoring in post-COVID complications. The currently unavailable molecular information collected continuously by the wearable sweat biosensors could have a profound public health impact and greatly facilitate our fundamental understanding of the roles of circulating biomarkers in long COVID to reduce susceptibility to post-COVID complications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Second, it will research ways to leverage this event partonomy into understanding actions in videos beyond recognition and perceive the current action in the context of the overall task being performed. This inference mechanism will enable an embodied, intelligent agent to recognize the current action and infer higher-level concepts such as human intent and goals in a unified energy-based framework. Third, it will realize the partonomy-based understanding framework in an embodied agent while augmenting it with active multimodal feedback. It will allow the embodied agent to perform active reasoning through feedback from the environment by controlling its geometric parameters (such as position, orientation, and pose) to navigate clutter and resolve any ambiguity in the perceived event structure. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by Robust Intelligence (RI) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preliminary studies indicate that groundwater may supply both dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and iron in this region. In coastal ecosystems like the West Florida Shelf that have very low nitrate and ammonium concentrations, DON is the main form of nitrogen available to organisms. Nitrogen cycling is strongly affected by iron availability because iron is essential for both photosynthesis and for nitrogen fixation. This study will investigate the sources and composition of DON and iron, and their influence on the coastal ecosystem. The team will sample offshore groundwater wells, river and estuarine waters, and conduct two expeditions across the West Florida Shelf in winter and summer. Investigators will participate in K-12 and outreach activities to increase awareness of the project and related science. The project will fund the work of six graduate and eight undergraduate students across five institutions, furthering NSF?s goals of education and training. <br/><br/>Motivated by preliminary observations of unexplained, tightly-correlated DON and dissolved iron concentrations across the West Florida Shelf (WFS), the proposed work will quantify the flux and isotopic signatures of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD)-derived DON and iron to the WFS, and evaluate the bioavailability of this temporally-variable source using four seasonal near-shore campaigns sampling offshore groundwater wells, estuarine, and riverine endmembers and two cross-shelf cruises. The work will evaluate whether SGD stimulates nitrogen fixation on the WFS, and the potential for the stimulated nitrogen fixation to further modify the chemistry of DON and dissolved iron in the region. The cross-shelf cruises will investigate hypothesized periods of maximum SGD and Trichodesmium abundance (June), and reduced river discharge and SGD (February), thus comparing two distinct biogeochemical regimes. The concentrations and isotopic compositions of DON and dissolved iron, molecular composition of DON, and the concentration and composition of iron-binding ligands will be characterized. Nitrogen fixation rates and Trichodesmium spp. abundance and expression of iron stress genes will be measured. Fluxes of DON and iron from SGD and rivers will be quantified with radium isotope mass balances. The impacts of SGD on nitrogen fixation and DON/ligand production will be constrained with incubations of natural phytoplankton communities with submarine groundwater amendments. Two hypotheses will be tested: 1) SGD is the dominant source of bioavailable DON and dissolved iron on the WFS, and 2) SGD-alleviation of iron stress changes the dominant Trichodesmium species on the WFS, increases nitrogen fixation rates and modifies DON and iron composition. Overall, the work will establish connections between marine nitrogen and iron cycling and evaluate the potential for coastal inputs to modify water along the WFS before export to the Atlantic Ocean. This study will thus provide a framework to consider these boundary fluxes in oligotrophic coastal systems and the relative importance of rivers and SGD as sources of nitrogen and iron in other analogous locations, such as coastal systems in Australia, India, and Africa, where nitrogen fixation and SGD have also been documented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much-needed efforts to broaden participation in the sciences have accelerated in recent years, particularly with respect to making science more welcoming and inclusive to individuals from groups that historically have been marginalized or excluded. Moreover, the popularity of recreational birding and the increasing number of volunteers participating in bird-themed citizen science projects has put ornithology in the spotlight with regard to calls for diversity and inclusion in the sciences. The joint 2022 conference of the American Ornithological Society (AOS) and BirdsCaribbean (BC) will be a powerful platform for activities to broaden participation in the field of ornithology. Being the first in-person meeting for either society in over two years, and being held in Puerto Rico, AOS & BC 2022 will be very well attended and will provide unusually strong training and outreach opportunities. By bringing together so many individuals with such diverse perspectives, the conference is certain to push ornithology in new directions.<br/><br/>This project will have direct impacts on diversity and inclusion within the discipline of ornithology. First, Diversity and Inclusion Travel Grants, and Caregiver Grants, will ensure a diverse pool of attendees. This diversity will be further enhanced by funds to support attendance by local Puerto Ricans. All of these attendees will participate in the broader scientific sessions, training workshops, and mentoring/networking events. Additionally, this project will support three workshops that will directly address broadening participation in ornithology. Together, these efforts at AOS & BC 2022 directly lead to a broader and more inclusive discipline, and will provide a solid basis for future efforts aimed at making ornithology and other STEM disciplines more diverse.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed work constitutes a systematic study of molecular reorganization and spin at molecule-metal oxide interfaces and has the potential to impact research areas across various application spaces including photocatalysis, photovoltaics, and quantum information sciences. The interdisciplinary project brings together knowledge in molecular inorganic, materials, and photophysical chemistry providing a broad foundation for educational enrichment at the K-12 and collegiate levels. Outreach, including efforts to promote diversity in science, will be a component of the funded work.<br/><br/>Long-lived, charge-separated states are critical to the realization of both photovoltaic and photocatalytic assemblies. The proposed research is motivated by the need to understand the role of molecular reorganization and metallic spin state in controlling charge-separated-state lifetimes and catalytic selectivity/efficiency. The research builds on their recent work exploring charge-transfer-induced spin-crossover compounds and the impact of the accompanying molecular reorganizations on photoinduced electron transfer processes. The results gathered from the proposed studies will enable the development of structure?function relationships with respect to spin and reorganization energies in photo-induced reactivity that, thus far, have been relatively unexplored.  They aim to answer the following questions: What is the role of high-spin/low-spin electronic state transitions on photo-induced charge separated lifetimes? Can the design principles uncovered in the previous aim be extended to more severe molecular reorganizations, i.e., intermolecular and intramolecular ligand association/dissociation?

Manufacturing is a foundation of economic growth and job creation across the U.S. and is constantly changing with improvements in technology, materials, and design. While this field is a pillar for economic growth within the U.S., manufacturing companies struggle to recruit a technically prepared workforce. When teachers have an opportunity to engage in research, seeing for themselves how knowledge is constructed for a field and understand how the work can influence the larger engineering or scientific community through the stages of research (identification of research questions through to the dissemination of the findings), their impact in the classroom will be increased as they incorporate these experiences into their classroom activities. This research experience for teachers (RET) program is focused on providing experiences for high school teachers and community college instructors to improve their understanding of how research progresses (scientific inquiry) and the field of advanced manufacturing. All teachers will be asked to design and develop classroom activities related to their research projects.  <br/><br/>The RET Site ?Engaging and Enabling Teachers through Advanced Manufacturing Research? at Clemson University seeks to provide transformative manufacturing research experiences for 30 high school teachers and community college instructors from South Carolina.  Each teacher will have agency over their own research project related to the development of advanced manufacturing materials or manufacturing techniques. By participating, the teacher?s confidence about manufacturing, knowledge of new manufacturing opportunities, and the research process is anticipated to increase. At the close of the program, each teacher will be able to convey the research process, the manufacturing landscape within the U.S., manufacturing career opportunities and different educational pathways into manufacturing to their students. The goals include: (1) expanding content knowledge of advanced and traditional materials manufacturing for teachers to support integration into new STEM and workforce development teaching and learning materials; (2) engaging teachers in advanced manufacturing research where they take on the role as the lead researcher and increase their understanding of how research leads to knowledge development; (3) providing teachers with professional development (mentoring on curriculum development, etc.) both during their research experience and the following academic year; (4) creating strong communication between the teacher, the RET leadership team and industrial advisory board to provide the teachers with support as they refine their curriculum modules; (5) increasing teacher self-efficacy related to manufacturing content knowledge and inquiry-based teaching; (6) increasing teachers? knowledge of regional career opportunities in advanced manufacturing to inspire their students to consider advanced manufacturing careers. The RET evaluation work will result in increased understandings of regionally-important questions related to workforce development, teacher learning and professional development, and post-secondary educational pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, levels of disgust, also called disgust sensitivity, can vary greatly among different individuals, which has implications for their behavior. In particular, research suggests that people higher in disgust sensitivity are more motivated to avoid certain objects, situations, and people. This doctoral research project investigates the broad question: why do people vary in their disgust sensitivity? One framework suggests that differences in the childhood environment may lead to differences in adult disgust sensitivity. This project is among the first to measure disgust sensitivity across a wide range of childhood ages to understand how disgust changes throughout growth and development. The researchers also examine cultural, individual, and environmental variables that may explain differences between individuals in their disgust sensitivity. These findings may be useful to health and education initiatives that focus on reducing infection risk and mitigating the progression of pandemics. Such initiatives will be aided by understanding when, why, and how children are motivated to avoid infection, and how this may vary across individuals and groups.<br/><br/>Infectious disease has been a longstanding feature of human societies. As a result, humans have seemingly developed cultural and biological strategies to avoid infectious exposure. Pathogen disgust sensitivity is proposed as one of the core motivational triggers to initiate avoidant behavior, yet little research has investigated how it develops during childhood or what explains variation among individuals. This project examines variables such as inflammation, energy budget, control over pathogen exposure, social learning, and gender, that may account for variation in pathogen disgust sensitivity across childhood. The researchers collect these variables using self-report and physiological measures among children 6 to 18 in two communities with distinctly different infection risk and access to resources. The empirical findings from this project will be integrated to build a biocultural understanding of individual and group variation in pathogen disgust sensitivity. Educational components of the project contribute to the goal of broadening participation in science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

BenU recognizes that hiring and retaining diverse faculty is important in education and mentorship of the growing diverse student population and their success in STEM; however, a low number of diverse STEM faculty, especially at small, primarily undergraduate institutions, carry additional ?unwritten? service resulting in an imbalance skewed towards service rather than scholarship. EAGLES aims to evaluate the processes before, during, and after BenU STEM faculty are hired through collection of faculty perceptions regarding current hiring, promotion process, and career flexibility policies to identify significant factors that can deter successful hiring and advancement.  In collaboration with ADVANCE networks and leadership, this project aims to develop strategies and guidelines on career flexibility, hiring, and retention that can better account for the equitable distribution of service expected of the low percentage of diverse faculty at small, primarily undergraduate institutions.<br/><br/>The goal of this ADVANCE Catalyst project is to address these inequities within BenU STEM by undertaking an extensive institutional assessment that will guide a data-driven strategic plan to 1) increase inclusive hiring policies and practices, 2) increase and improve faculty career flexibility, and 3) promote leadership advancement for marginalized groups in STEM (female, persons with disabilities, persons who identify as LGBTQ+, and PEERs). The institutional assessment will include data collection and analysis via external consulting reviews and internal reviews (e.g. faculty climate and perception surveys). The assessment will be supported through the guidance of an Advisory Board of internal and external academic and administrative leaders. The project?s findings will be broadly disseminated across BenU and through open source platforms that peer institutions can use. The broader impacts of the project will enable an expansion of essential training in DEI and collaborative efforts to address inequities at BenU. The project?s outcomes aim to provide systemic changes that dovetail with current university efforts and promote the inclusion of talented and experienced females, PEERs, persons with disabilities, and persons who identify as LGBTQ+ among STEM faculty. Implementation of the findings aims to align the diversity of the BenU faculty with its diverse student population.<br/> <br/>The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions.

Currently, there are no remote, self-use eye imaging options available to patients. Age-related macular degeneration (AMD), diabetic retinopathy (DR), and glaucoma represent leading causes of irreversible vision loss in the US. Early detection, consistent follow-up, and timely treatment are essential in preventing blindness. Remote monitoring removes the patient barriers associated with in-person visits such as time off from work and child care and travel costs and presents an opportunity to improve the quality of care. Studies have demonstrated that home-based testing with increased frequency can detect glaucoma progression over 1.5 years sooner than traditional testing. Early studies in home-based AMD monitoring have also demonstrated higher detection rates for neovascular disease and lower rates of vision loss. In the US, access to ophthalmologic care remains limited; Fewer than half of the 12 million Americans with diabetes undergo screening for retinopathy, and an estimated 2.4 million Americans have undetected glaucoma. Rates of AMD, glaucoma and DR continue to rise precipitously, and addressing the widening gaps in health equity in ophthalmologic care requires new solutions.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a portable, self-administered anterior segment and retinal fundus-imaging device to facilitate evaluation of vision threatening diseases such as diabetic retinopathy (DR), age-related macular degeneration (AMD), and glaucoma using telemedicine. The proposed device includes instrumentation and software that automates the eye exam, allowing patients to self-image. From the patient?s home, the patient receives remote screening and monitoring of potentially blinding conditions. Alongside this device, the team plans to build a data platform to enable collection, use and sharing of data for tele-ophthalmology services to facilitate remote evaluation with providers.

The interplay between mathematical models and probability is rich and profound with applications far-reaching across all fields of science. This interplay can appear in many physical settings in materials science and fluid dynamics, but also in the modeling of various many-agent or many-particle dynamics, such as the self-organized motion of organisms or the spread of an infectious disease through a population. The Centre de Recherches Mathmatiques is organizing an intensive thematic program on this topic, ""Probabilities and PDEs"" during the period January 2022 -- July 2022. There will be four workshops, each with mini courses specifically aimed at graduate students or early-career researchers in related areas, and many long-term visiting scientists as well. This award provides funding to support the participation of US-based graduate students, early career researchers, and under-represented minorities through travel and accommodation during one of the two workshops and accompanying mini-courses. This will provide the participants with a perfect opportunity to interact with each other and with leaders of the field and will help them to understand the major questions and learn the cutting-edge methods of the field.<br/><br/>Probability and PDEs have always been intertwined and modern research continues to intertwine them further. One common aspect concerns how introducing randomness into PDEs, through e.g. random initial data, random environments, random forcing will profoundly affect the long-term behavior, either because it provides a flexible and realistic approach to study physical models or because it is an inevitable feature of models of the underlying systems. Another aspect is how one can obtain deterministic PDEs from underlying random many-agent or many-problems, such as in classical kinetic theory or in many-agent problems such as in mathematical epidemiology. The program will bring together world experts and junior researchers in an intensive and focused program that will help to greatly further the understanding of these phenomena and this award will help train the next generation of US-based scientists in these methods.

The proposed modeling strategy is transformer-based, but it can represent context relationships going arbitrarily far back in time, something ordinarily infeasible, and it can also rapidly adapt to changing statistics via a novel adaptive final neural network layer. <br/><br/>This work will result in a system that can transparently interpose network control messages to reduce bandwidth through forecasting and extrapolation.  It will also help to mask packet delays and drops over wireless channels improving network coordination critical to many XR applications like AR guided surgery, search and rescue, digital telepresence and automotive heads up displays.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Turbulent mixing results from complex and chaotic motions that span a large range of spatial and temporal scales. As such, it is particularly challenging to measure and model, yet it has vast and important consequences. In the ocean, turbulent mixing controls transport of heat, freshwater, dissolved gasses, and pollutants. It is crucial for ocean biology because it both determines the flow field for the smallest plankton, and it sets large-scale gradients of nutrient availability. It is also central to understanding the energetics of the ocean and reducing the uncertainties in global circulation and climate models: recent work has shown that the spatial and temporal non-homogeneity in deep-ocean mixing may play a critical role in climate; understanding the physics that drives the distribution of deep-ocean mixing intensity is critical. Yet even after a half a century of efforts to understand its global distribution, observations are still sparse; a variety of direct and indirect methods are still needed to characterize the dynamical processes that lead to turbulence, and inferences of mixing from larger scale budgets. As such, the physics of ocean mixing is actively studied using a variety of observational techniques (direct measure of velocity and temperature fluctuations at the smallest (mm) scales, inferences from large-scale turbulent overturns, observations of net mixing by purposeful dye release) numerical and theoretical approaches, as well as laboratory experiments. Finally, the consequences of mixing for larger scale climate models (which do not directly resolve mixing) are addressed by turning dynamical insights of the previously mentioned work into practical parameterizations. As a concrete example, using different mixing schemes in numerical climate models changes predicted tropical ocean temperatures by more than a degree and predicted sea level rise by more than 30 cm. Mixing is one of the greatest sources of uncertainty plaguing today?s models with impact of great societal relevance. A regularly held GRC on Ocean Mixing provides a needed forum to improve the broader community?s understanding of turbulent mixing in the ocean, and with it a variety of deep and broad implications for everything from climate change to global nutrient patterns that underlie our fisheries. The GRC format encourages precisely the sort of interdisciplinary thinking and collaboration that is so vital to addressing these societal issues. This GRC, in particular, helps our scientific community be the most vibrant & inclusive it can be. The ocean mixing has historically suffered from poor diversity, which, while improved in recent years, still needs an influx of new people, a broadening of ties amongst domestic and international collaborators, and increased interdisciplinary interactions. NSF support will explicitly be used to expand the demographic, professional and geographic diversity of participants by supporting attendance of under-represented and under-resourced groups who stand to benefit from the intellectual environment and networking opportunities of the GRC format.<br/><br/><br/>The purpose and scope of this Gordon Research Conference is to provide a forum for discussion of the rapidly evolving field of ocean mixing. Emphasis is threefold: observations of mixing in the world, new insights into dynamics that control mixing rates, and impacts of mixing on regional and global circulation and budgets. The latter two include development of parameterizations to turn dynamical insights into useful things to include in regional models and global numerical climate models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The configuration and interaction of tectonic plates throughout Earth?s history is recognized to play a critical role in Earth?s crustal evolution. The Acasta Gneiss Complex (AGC) of the Northwest Territories, Canada, exposes the oldest known continental crustal rocks. This project will characterize the detailed geochemistry of an important mineral, zircon, in the AGC to evaluate the role of plate tectonic style (?stagnant-lid? vs. ?mobile-lid?) in continent formation. Ratios of trace elements and isotopes in zircon will allow the PIs to track changes in AGC crustal compositions over the course of approximately 1 billion years of Earth?s history, starting 4 billion years ago. Because of their extreme age, AGC zircon grains accumulate damage to the crystal structure over geologic time. As a result, many (though not all), zircon grains in Acasta have had their age and chemistry altered. This work combines diverse methods of imaging, mass spectrometry and structural characterization of zircon, allowing the PIs to identify unaltered zircon chemistries and to evaluate the timing of alteration processes. Results of the characterization of zircon will also provide information about changes in continental crustal production and links between tectonic style and the formation of the oldest continents on Earth. This research will also support community outreach in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin Geology Museum to improve scientific literacy and expand the public?s understanding of geologic time.<br/><br/>The 4 to 3 Ga Acasta Gneiss Complex (AGC), Canada, comprises over one billion years of magmatism, including the oldest known exposures of felsic terrestrial crust, and thereby is a critical archive of early terrestrial differentiation. The mineral zircon has been invaluable for tracking the chronology and sources of magmatism in the AGC; however, pervasive alteration of age, trace element, and isotope chemical information (often related to radiation-damage-induced loss of crystallinity and recrystallization) has impaired efforts to construct robust U-Pb geochronological, ?18O, and trace element records spanning the duration of AGC magmatism. This work will apply a novel and diverse set of characterization methods (plasma and secondary ion mass spectrometry, Raman spectroscopy, and atom probe tomography) to: 1) expand the primary U-Pb isotope, ?18O, and trace element record for AGC zircon grains in tandem with the whole-rock geochemical record, including tectonic provenance proxies Sc and Nb as well as alteration proxy OH in zircon; and 2) interrogate the grain-scale to nanoscale manifestations of repeated thermal events and fluid interactions within zircon grains by atom probe tomography. Ultimately, the work will clarify primary versus secondary zircon chemistry, the length scales of element mobility during a multistage thermal and metamorphic history, and the primary 4-3 Ga magmatic and tectonic history of the AGC. This research will also support community outreach in collaboration with the University of Wisconsin Geology Museum to improve scientific literacy and expand the public?s understanding of geologic time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference will be held August 7 - 12, 2022 at Mt. Holyoke College, South Hadley, MA. The purpose of the conference is to bring world experts together to discuss the forefront of ceramics research to advance research and engineering in the United States and to expose graduate students and early career professionals to the latest findings in the science of ceramics so that they may become the leaders of tomorrow. The funding is meant to encourage graduate students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, to participate to enhance their engineering and science education. <br/><br/>Many of the most interesting and technologically relevant properties of ceramics derive from coupled phenomena (mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, magnetic, optical) that originate at the atomistic and nanometer length scales, but manifest across all scales. The complex behavior of ceramics under extreme conditions and/or away from equilibrium leads, on the one hand, to challenges in deciphering behavioral mechanisms, and on the other, to opportunities to create ceramics with unprecedented properties. Advanced manufacturing depends on these types of scientific advances. A wide variety of experimental and theoretical tools have recently emerged to reveal multiphysical, multiscale mechanisms that govern material behavior during processing and service. These specifically include the emergence of data driven atomistic and mesocontinuum computational modeling approaches, novel in situ experiments, and measurements under extreme conditions. Advanced manufacturing is a critical part of the future of ceramics and will be embedded in sessions for the entire conference. Sessions that will explicitly address advanced manufacturing include Achieving Exceptional Responses in Structural Ceramics and Processing of Complex Structures.

With the growing incidence of natural and human-induced disruptions, it has become critical that network service is resilient to unforeseen disruptive events. The state of the art in wireless network design does not directly provision for large-scale disruptive events such as a weather event disabling base-stations. In other words, the wireless networks of today play a small role in ensuring its own resiliency. Our research advances the national infrastructure, prosperity and welfare by providing a novel resiliency paradigm for Next Generation networks. In particular, the specific aim of this research is to design a new generation of wireless networks that stay vigilant by sensing both the internal system state and the external environment. The inclusion of sensing into a future physical layer will be a cornerstone of realizing next generation (such as 6G) wireless networks. Joint sensing and communication will enable high performance allocation of limited resources and create the ability for the network to reason about itself and its environment. We assert that such a paradigm needs to adopt the following design principles: First and foremost, resilient systems assume that unforeseen disruptions can and will occur.  Second, the systems are smart in their vigilance by actively managing the resources to form a world-view that enables active preparedness and resilience. Third, armed with active vigilance, resilient systems are in a constant state of preparedness, continually adapting their view of the world by counterfactually reasoning about the system?s future. <br/><br/>This project will facilitate the translation of academic research through an active and sustained engagement with industry on this future network design.

There has been substantial recent progress demonstrating feasibility of radio frequency integrated circuits (RFICs) built with low-cost silicon semiconductor processes, for lower mmWave frequency bands such as 28 GHz licensed spectrum (for 5G cellular), and 60 GHz unlicensed spectrum (for next-generation WiFi).  This project aims to provide a quantum leap beyond these efforts, developing strategically important and commercially viable technologies for opening up upper mmWave bands beyond 100 GHz. A specific goal is to develop antenna arrays with thousands of elements, capable of forming agile pencil beams tracking mobile devices, which can be miniaturized into compact form factors because of the tiny wavelengths at 100+ GHz. The project investigates novel approaches for co-design of hardware and algorithms for scaling array sizes, targeting significant jumps in attainable link distances and data rates (10 Gbps per mobile user in an urban cell, and 100 Gbps for a fixed wireless alternative to fiber).<br/><br/>Millimeter wave (mmWave) communication will play a crucial role in next-generation communication infrastructures. A fundamental bottleneck in mmWave hardware development is packaging: ?fitting? the RFIC electronics becomes difficult at small carrier wavelengths due to the standard constraint of half-wavelength spacing between antennas.  This project investigates novel hardware architectures that sidestep such packaging bottlenecks to realize massive extended arrays, along with closely coupled innovations in all-digital hierarchical signal processing architectures, targeting quantum leaps in capacity and resilience. Hardware research includes development of extremely low-cost 140GHz transceiver modular array tile technologies that readily scale to arrays having vast numbers of elements. Signal processing and systems research develops all-digital hierarchical signal processing architectures matched to the tiled hardware architecture, illustrating the system-level impact of the robustness and additional spatial degrees of freedom provided by extended arrays in canonical multiuser (MU) MIMO and Line of Sight (LoS) MIMO settings aimed at flexible, cost-effective deployment of access and backhaul nodes. A key design concept is spatial redundancy: by choosing hardware and system parameters such that the number of array RF channels greatly exceeds the number of MIMO signals involved, it becomes possible to simplify power consumption and die area by sacrificing dynamic range.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stigma, a strong feeling of disapproval, of MHCs is a society-wide issue that tends to conflict with help-seeking attitudes of those having MHCs. Engineering is known as a demanding field, where a culture of high stress and endurance is often promoted, with specific challenges to socialization. These factors tend to be linked to the onset and persistence of MHCs. Nevertheless, it is known that while engineering students do not have a higher prevalence of MHCs, those that have them are less prone to seek help than those in other professional areas. This project will explore elements of the engineering culture that may reinforce stigmatized views of MHCs, therefore limiting the ability of students and early professionals to seek help when they need it. This study will explore the experiences of students and early professionals to understand elements of the engineering culture that influence their internalized stigma, interest to learn about MHCs, and ability to help others. The project team will pay attention to students' interactions with other actors such as faculty and administrators to explore how the beliefs about MHCs are perpetuated in engineering education spaces. This study has the potential to bring valuable insights into professional cultures and how they interact with the prevalence and management of MHCs, such as key dynamics, contexts, and interactions that might promote negative views of MHCs.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to identify elements of engineering culture that influence the stigma of MHCs and consequently affect the help-seeking attitudes of students and early professionals. This will be achieved through a three-year longitudinal sequential mixed methods study. Each year the relationship between the stigma of MHCs and help-seeking attitudes will be measured quantitatively through a survey with established instruments. The results of the first-year survey will be analyzed under the principles of maximum variability to inform our longitudinal multi-case study that will use thematic and narrative analyses. The longitudinal quantitative analysis will examine the evolution of the considered relationships through the years of the participants? engineering training and transition to professional life, and how they are moderated by their characteristics, perceptions of engineering culture, engineering identity, and sense of belonging. This longitudinal approach will explore the important transition point where engineering students leave academic spaces to engage in their first professional experiences and its impact on their mental well being. The research design will also enable the study of how the outlook of students without MHCs evolves through time. Since MHCs can develop at any point in life and many elements of college life, including those specific to engineering training, have been linked to poor mental health outcomes, the result of this project have the potential to identify elements from learning and practicing engineering that could contribute to the onset of MHCs. Project results will provide a comprehensive description of the challenges experienced by students and early professionals of all backgrounds with MHCs.  A partnership with the National Alliance of Mental Illness (NAMI) will enable a national reach of audiences in and out universities that will be supported through some of their established initiatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Small drones (2-25 kg) have been used widely in various applications, such as law enforcement, digital agriculture, fire monitoring and prevention, and geospatial surveying/mapping. These drone users often require long flight times to address tasks that cannot be completed by battery-powered small drones. The proposed micro gas turbine technology may increase the flight duration of small drones from 20 minutes to over 2 hours, which may significantly increase the practicability of using small drones in many applications. In addition, the proposed micro gas turbines do not require a mobile fuel-based electric generator, which avoids the fire hazard from liquid fuel storage. Furthermore, the micro gas turbine is capable of working in harsh environments, such as at high and low temperatures and in humid areas, where batteries often fail. Overall, the technology under development may enable commercialization of applications that will benefit from longer flying duration drones or compact power generation in remote fields. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a micro gas turbine technology to allow small drone users to extend flight endurance by replacing battery power with a compact turbine-based hybrid energy supply system. The proposed system has been found to be fuel-efficient, lighter, and save service time/cost. The proposed technology may increase the flight time of small drones by a factor of four at 1 kg system weight when compared to the most advanced lithium polymer batteries. The micro gas engine uses a unique engine architecture, advanced materials, and additive manufacturing techniques to ensure a reliable onboard power generation system. In addition, the proposed engine utilizes compressed high-pressure hydrogen as fuel, which has a high energy density and zero carbon emissions. Hydrogen is pre-heated after passing through the combustor wall, then mixed with compressed air and burned in a premixed combustion mode through high-temperature porous media. The proposed micro gas turbine engine may significantly advance design and fabrication technologies in small and portable power conversion devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technology may provide a stem cell researcher with the ability to grow cells on a substrate and more readily replicate the results with the assurance that the cells can be safely delivered to patients. This method may produce new treatments for chronic diseases in patients while decreasign the time to governmental approvals for the therapeutic uses of stem cells. Current substrates vary from batch to batch due to the nature of their derivation, but the proposed technology seeks to produce the same substrate over and over, with minimal variation, providing reproducibility. This reproducibility may generate treatments to help millions of individuals.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a synthetic substrate and method that is reproducible, is eady to use, reduces the time to effective treatment, and sustains the derivation and long-term culture of human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) in an undifferentiated state without genetic abnormalities and equal genetic profile. The interest in the public and private sector in producing hPSCs at a large scale has grown significantly due to the potential benefits that these cells bring to regenerative medicine. However, stem cell translation from the laboratory to medical applications has been slow because the substrates used for growing the cells are not xenogenic-free (xeno-free), not reproducible, and not chemically defined; This results in cultures with non-consistent quality. The goal of this project is to resolve this problem in the stem cell ecosystem. The proposed substrate allows the growth of hPSCs in a xeno-free and defined environment with high reproducibility resulting in methods which may save time and effort. If succesasful, academic stem cell research labs, clinical labs, bio-banks, pharmaceutical manufacturerers, and bioengineering companies will be certain that they are producing cells free of any cross-contamination and ready for direct use in regenerative medicine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has both scientific and societal benefits and integrates research with education. Mastering concepts central to the study of law and science enables a deeper exploration of the historically contingent and ongoing relationships between law and society; however, few undergraduates are trained to engage in rigorous analysis of the law. The overall goal of the Digital Legal Research Lab REU Site is to equip a diverse cohort of undergraduate researchers with the analytical and technical skills needed to engage in digital legal inquiry and generate new insights in the study of law and science. This foundational training will prepare students to develop their own analytical questions, disseminate research findings, establish distinct research identities, and craft competitive applications for funding opportunities and graduate programs. This REU Site will engage a diverse group of students who contribute unique perspectives to digital legal research. This program will diversify the fields of law and science and train talented undergraduates to advance critical inquiry into past and present trends in crime, violence, and policing; legal decision making; legal mobilization and conceptions of justice; and litigation and the legal profession.   <br/><br/>The intensive ten-week program will support eight undergraduate students per year and will include an orientation to the varied methodologies and tools needed to effectively analyze historical and ongoing legal practices and structures, an introduction to mixed-methods research design, and analysis of primary source materials from digital and physical repositories. Specifically, students will analyze freedom suits and habeas petitions comprising a vital case study of freedom-making between 1770 and 1924 to demonstrate the widespread legal mobilization of marginalized petitioners who challenged exploitation during the long nineteenth century, and whose largely unexamined and unpublished stories are central to the American legal canon.  In addition to assessing trends in marginalized people?s legal mobilization against various forms of institutional and interpersonal confinement, researchers will participate in the innovative restructuring of archival legal data that shifts away from traditional forms of indexing focused on case party names and dates to a system that prioritizes demographic and relational data across parties and petition types.

Most new college and university faculty in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) begin their teaching careers with little or no experience with methods of effective pedagogy, including methods for addressing and improving diversity, equity, and inclusion. To remedy this problem in physics and astronomy, the American Association of Physics Teachers, the American Astronomical Society, and the American Physical Society propose to build on and bolster the successful series of Physics and Astronomy Faculty Workshops. With partners from the University of Virginia, the University of Washington (Bothell), and the University of Arizona, the project will implement a significant redesign of the workshops based on what has been learned from participant feedback, workshop evaluations, research into faculty professional development, and the needs of today?s faculty. Effective practices for enhancing diversity, equity and inclusion will be integrated throughout the workshops. In addition to tenure-track faculty, the project will foster the participation of adjunct, part-time, and primarily instructional faculty, who, collectively, teach an increasing fraction of physics and astronomy courses across the country.  <br/><br/>The project redesign will add four new components: (1) a restructured program delivered by a core set of well-prepared presenters, focusing on the development of participants? Individual Development Plans; (2) an overarching emphasis on the professional development of the ?whole faculty member,? as faculty members grow as educators, researchers, and professionals; (3) an enhanced set of post-workshop activities to provide coaching and feedback for the workshop participants as they implement student-centered instructional practices; and (4) a research program focusing on how faculty develop from novices to reflective practitioners in their role as educators. Despite the successes of the New Faculty Workshops to date, studies show that some faculty members do not persist in implementing those pedagogical practices. The redesigned program will directly address this ""implementation dip"" by developing habits of mind that support resilience, reflection, and continuous improvement of teaching, and engaging faculty in an inclusive community of educators that helps them navigate and integrate student-centered teaching practices throughout their careers.  The research and evaluation are designed to inform the improvement of workshops and post-workshop activities and contribute to an understanding of the role of reflective practice in tackling the implementation gap associated with sustaining student centered pedagogical practice in undergraduate STEM education.

It is the most productive stretch of the Southern Ocean, supporting an array of marine life, including Antarctic toothfish ? the region?s top fish predator. While a commercial fishery for toothfish continues to grow in the Ross Sea, fundamental knowledge gaps remain regarding toothfish ecology and the impacts of toothfish fishing on the broader Ross Sea ecosystem. Recognizing the global value of the Ross Sea, a large (>2 million km2) marine protected area was adopted by the multi-national Commission for the Conservation of Antarctic Marine Living Resources in 2016. This research will fill a critical gap in the knowledge of Antarctic toothfish and deepen understanding of biological-physical interactions for fish ecology, while contributing to knowledge of impacts of fishing and environmental change on the Ross Sea system. This work will further provide innovative tools for studying connectivity among geographically distinct fish populations and for synthesizing and assessing the efficacy of a large-scale marine protected area. In developing an integrated research and education program in engaged scholarship, this project seeks to train the next generation of scholars to engage across the science-policy-public interface, engage with Southern Ocean stakeholders throughout the research process, and to deepen the public?s appreciation of the Antarctic. <br/><br/>A major research priority among Ross Sea scientists is to better understand the life history of the Antarctic toothfish and test the efficacy of the Ross Sea Marine Protected Area (MPA) in protecting against the impacts of overfishing and climate change. Like growth rings of a tree, fish ear bones, called otoliths, develop annual layers of calcium carbonate that incorporates elements from their environment. Otoliths offer information on the fish?s growth and the surrounding ocean conditions. Hypothesizing that much of the Antarctic toothfish life cycle is structured by ocean circulation, this research employs a multi-disciplinary approach combining age and growth work with otolith chemistry testing, while also utilizing GIS mapping. The project will measure life history parameters as well as trace elements and stable isotopes in otoliths in three distinct sets collected over the last four decades in the Ross Sea. The information will be used to quantify the transport pathways Antarctic toothfish use across their life history, and across time, in the Ross Sea. The project will assess if toothfish populations from the Ross Sea are connected more widely across the Antarctic. By comparing life history and otolith chemistry data across time, the researchers will assess change in life history parameters and spatial dynamics and seek to infer if these changes are driven by fishing or climate change. Spatially mapping of these data will allow an assessment of the efficacy of the Ross Sea MPA in protecting toothfish and where further protections might be needed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While these systems are designed to cope with failures, there continue to be instances where anomalous conditions, whether brought about by an intentional attack or unfortunate natural circumstance, compromise the network?s ability to perform. These network failures are often the result of individual components that all make implicit assumptions about the dependability of other components that, in fact, are themselves making the same or similar assumptions, leading to simultaneous failure. This research project takes an overarching multi-layered, systems-level approach to prepare applications for the inevitable component failures by providing a shadow network: pre-planned alternatives ready to deliver critical services should the primary services, networks, or paths fail. The shadow network continually seeks out and analyzes applications and services to identify resilience and combine end-to-end services using a mix of primary and specifically designed shadow components, such that should failures occur, the shadow components can take effective action. By increasing the reliability of the network-at-large, users of all Internet applications will benefit by reducing the frequency in which the ?network is down?. Preventing Internet failures naturally provides engagement with the general public, standards bodies, and policymakers, as well as any students, from secondary to Ph.D., interested in research with real-world impact.<br/><br/>The research takes a three-pronged approach toward shadow network development. First, the design considers shadow components for every aspect of the application, providing the basis for reliability. Second, the research investigates how to continually utilize measurement-driven testing to assess overall and component-specific reliability to be ready for a wide range of potential outage and failure scenarios. Last, the research investigates the programmability of existing and emerging components to scale up the shadow services when they are needed and to prioritize critical applications and overall availability. The methods used to perform the research includes resilient network design and deployment, protocol design, experimentation, monitoring and testing, and modeling and analysis. Evaluation consists of a combination of prototype, simulation, and mathematical analysis, and is scored in terms of efficiency, cost, resiliency, and reliability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These improvements will in turn help coastal communities to prepare for the maximum potential damage and lead to saving lives and minimizing the losses of properties. This project will train two Ph.D. students and a postdoc in fields of atmospheric dynamics, modeling, and data science, and support STEM education by working with an undergraduate student to launch experimental forecasts for TC intensity and size based on the knowledge gained from the project.

The main goal of this project is to explore the dependencies of radial loss of AAM and eAAM values on environment factors so that the eAAM model would better explain the observed complexity and rich diversity of TC intensity-size relation. This research is guided by the central hypothesis substantiated by three process-based working hypotheses. Under this framework, different eAAM values result from differences in the inward radial loss of AAM that depends environment conditions. The central question of how the inward radial loss rate of AAM and eAAM are related to environment conditions is investigated through 6 sets of A-B series numerical experiments using the Cloud Model Version 1 (CM1) model for the A-series and cloud-permitting version of the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model for the B-series. The resultant environment-dependent eAAM model will be validated by requiring that both the eAAM-predicted TC winds using observed size information and the eAAM-predicted TC sizes using observed wind information are highly in agreement (within observation uncertainties) with their observational counterparts<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

U.S. water infrastructure comprises more than 2.2 million miles of pipes, most of which are underground and unseen by millions of consumers. A large proportion of these pipes are located in areas vulnerable to earthquakes. This project targets water utilities in these critical earthquake zones (around one-fourth of all utilities in the U.S.) as potential customers. These water utilities must confront deep uncertainties about their aging water pipe networks and their ability to sustain natural and human-induced earthquakes. The utilities have to conduct a seismic vulnerability assessment and identify critical pipes in their networks that should be rehabilitated. This project may help water utilities in critical earthquake zones that need to make difficult rehabilitation decisions about their water infrastructure system. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of water infrastructure systems for a highly uncertain environment. Despite technological advances, water utility managers are often limited in their understanding of seismic concerns.

So far such virtualization efforts have met with very limited success, making inroads largely with 4G/LTE small cells. This is because 5G and beyond employ compute-intensive technologies such as massive multiple-input, multiple output (MIMO) and low-density parity-check (LDPC) code to deliver the unprecedented network performance. Massive MIMO not only demands massive computational power itself, but also proportionally increases that of LDPC. Not surprisingly, existing commercial massive MIMO solutions all rely on specialized, dedicated hardware such as FPGA and application-specific integrated circuits. Massive MIMO remains the largest barrier toward virtualized mobile networks. The goal of the proposed project is to overcome this technical barrier and virtualize the massive MIMO physical layer for NextG network systems. In doing so, the project will expedite the adoption of massive MIMO, resulting in more capable, more efficient, and more cost-effective mobile networks. Through our ongoing collaborations with industry leaders, the project will timely transfer technologies into practice. It also provides a meeting ground for software systems and wireless communication research and creates timely content for teaching Computer Science majors about the wireless physical layer. The project will provide a platform to engage undergraduate students and high-school students in computing research, especially women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>The project targets the following scientific contributions. (1) Design and implementation of the massive MIMO physical layer that scales up on a many-core server efficiently and intelligently. We will combine the efficiency of static and elasticity of dynamic task scheduling and devise latency-driven, automated schemes for optimal resource provisioning. (2) Distributed design and implementation that can utilize compute resources integrated over a local-area network, beyond a single server. We will leverage programmable switches to minimize the impact of the network and to utilize commodity servers as well as accelerators to achieve scale, cost effectiveness and energy efficiency beyond the reach of a single many-core server. (3) Elastic design and implementation that match up to dynamics in mobile network workload, simultaneously achieving high resilience, low cost for the network operator, and high utilization for the cloud provider, in a multi-tenant environment. We will explore serverless computing and develop it further to better meet the stringent latency requirement of the massive MIMO physical layer.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Low latency is essential for these services; emerging real-time applications will typically need assistance from a mobile edge cloud (MEC) for real-time operation. This emerging scenario introduces significant new challenges: mobile devices are heterogeneous, ranging from energy-harvesting sensors to automobiles, but storage and compute resources are generally limited and communication is often over low-bandwidth channels;  real-time deployment of trained ML models requires autonomous computation and decision-making that is adaptive to heterogeneous time-varying  local environments; devices need to make high-accuracy inferences on high-dimensional data in real time; devices continuously gather new data that must be processed, aggregated, and communicated to the MEC; mobile users have heterogenous privacy preferences that require privacy-sensitive use of the MEC; and the applications and services on the mobile devices must be resilient to changes in both the cyber and physical worlds in order to ensure personal safety.  This project is aimed at the design and experimental validation of an MEC-based distributed ML system that accounts for these factors.<br/><br/>In this setting of real-time operation, online decision-making, and offline training of ML-based applications that must be resilient to data, application, user, and system changes, this research program has four facets: (1) Edge-centric distributed ML models to enable both real-time inferences at mobile devices and fast distributed semi-supervised training are being developed and evaluated.

This project draws from theoretical work across the humanities and even outside of the academy to change the way we think about knowledge about our living worlds. Currently biology education continues to rely on memorization of biological facts. Those facts are often simplified and narrowly developed in one discipline. By integrating knowledge from current science and technology literature into biology curriculum, undergraduate students will learn additional skills for engaging in science and research throughout their lives. The developed curriculum aims to shift how all people think about their competence and ethical responsibility to understand and fully participate in science. This study therefore has the potential to impact who becomes interested and invested in biology by using participatory ways of learning. This pedagogical intervention will contribute to the benefits of science to be more evenly distributed throughout society. The project outcomes will be of interest to policy makers, educators, parents and students. <br/><br/>The project is broken into three parts. The first part provides the basis and rationale for the project by analyzing current biology textbooks identifying points for intervention. Part two of the project culls research on the subject matter of biology, bodies and environments, from interdisciplinary academic and non-academic sources that are typically underrepresented in biology education. The final part of the project integrates these knowledges into education modules to be tested in classes and public forums. To realize its potential and allow for future expansion to K-12 and larger segments of the public, the results will be made broadly accessible to educators and laypersons through open access. This project may also serve as a model for how more interdisciplinary research can be successfully conducted across typical divisions between the humanities and sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project results will also raise awareness of graduate mental health in engineering programs by preparing faculty in leadership positions to change the climate in graduate programs directly. These changes will serve as evidence-based models that increase the adoption of practices to support mental health and promote student wellbeing.<br/><br/>This project will examine the mental health crisis by focusing on the role of GPDs in integrating frameworks of care that consider the full range of traumas graduate students have experienced or could experience. The results of this investigation will characterize the roles of engineering GPDs and inform the development of methods to train a community of GPDs to implement evidence-based practices that foster care. This project will use a two-phase research design to address three research questions (RQ): RQ1: What are the characteristic roles of engineering graduate program directors in fostering cultures of care in their programs? RQ2: How do the systemic structures within higher education impact engineering graduate program directors? implementation of trauma-informed frameworks of care? RQ3: What professional development program features can support engineering graduate program directors? perceived ability to integrate trauma-informed frameworks of care in their approach to supporting graduate students?  Phase 1 will leverage sequential mixed methods through a national survey followed by semi-structured interviews to characterize the roles of engineering GPDs and how programs leverage care practices. Phase 2 will build on these characterizations to collaboratively develop an evidence-based professional development framework for creating trauma-informed systems of care within engineering graduate programs. We will integrate a group coaching professional development approach with collaborative inquiry to explore the lived experiences of the GPDs participating and enable their attempts to foster care in their programs. The research design will expand existing theories for implementing trauma-informed frameworks of care to promote positive mental health and wellbeing within engineering graduate education. The results will inform the practices that faculty and instructors can use to realize the broad impact of trauma and recognize students experiencing, coping, and reacting to trauma. Four broader impacts will emerge from this project: (1) A characterization of GPD roles in engineering that researchers can use to accelerate other educational innovations in graduate engineering education, (2) A prototype developed and disseminated in collaboration with GPDs and an advisory board containing licensed professional counselors that can empower and enable GPDs to respond to students experiencing trauma and to minimize the occurrence of new trauma, (3) Structural changes to support students that have or will experience trauma, so they can return to deep learning and increase their likelihood to persist, and (4) Faculty who can better support systemically minoritized students through the implementation of care practices that respond to students? identity-driven experiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A typical scenario is one where a substantial number of entities (clients, organizations, communities thereof) participate in a learning task; each of these entities owns, has access to, or generates part of an overall data set which would be impractical or undesirable to gather at a central location. While the entities benefit from a collaboration, especially in settings where the amount of local data is relatively small and thus the ability of an entity to learn a model on its own is limited, such a collaboration requires major network resources. This research project centers on developing new, as well as expanding traditional, engineering principles for the design of resilient and scalable networked learning systems. To this end, the project investigates interrelated themes spanning the development of theoretical underpinnings, network architecture, applications and protocol design. The broader impacts offer advances in education, enhancing diversity, engaging the community and industry, and disseminating results to a wider public.<br/><br/>The project will initially focus on Federated Learning (FL) frameworks and, in Theme 1, study how to achieve resilience to uncertainty in FL systems experiencing intermittent client availability and time-varying network capacity. This leads to a novel approach to FL which effectively ""learns how to learn"" in an uncertain/resource-constrained environment. Theme 2 addresses scalability challenges encountered in large-scale FL by relying on clustering of ""exchangeable"" clients. This moves from client-centric to an efficient cluster-centric system management by leveraging multicast-based estimation/tracking of cluster populations, combined with probabilistic scheduling of clients in the clusters. This offers new avenues to scalability and resiliency as well as potential privacy enhancements. Theme 3 builds on ideas from rate-distortion theory and scalable video coding, and explores the use of scalable/layered (learned) model compression as a basis for adaptive congestion-aware FL. A key idea here is recognizing that aggressive compression leads to faster delivery, which motivates the search for a tradeoff sweet spot where FL performs more updates but with poorer (noisier) models. This research exemplifies research synergies of ideas from information, queueing and learning theory towards achieving resilience and adaptability. The project also pursues the design and use of overlay Data Aggregation Networks which exploit the aggregative character of model updates via in-network update aggregation and associated data compression. This can be viewed as the dual of Content Delivery Network overlays which are a core element managing the cost and performance in current network infrastructure. Theme 4 recognizes that at the base of FL applications is client participation and thus brings into focus the joint incentivization of clients and management of limited resources in uncertain environments. Overall, the proposed research focuses on new forms of network intelligence and adaptability, aiming to address scalability through device-to-edge-to-cloud continuum.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous studies in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica suggest that viral infections of microbes, and a general lack of fertilizers (i.e., nutrients), may be important factors shaping the development and functioning of microbial communities in cryoconite holes.  The researchers propose an experimental approach to understand how nutrient limitation affects diversity (number of species) and overall abundance of microbes, and how the diversity and abundance of microbes in turn affects the diversity, abundance, and infection type of viruses that parasitize the microbes in cryoconite sediments.  The researchers will use sediments previously collected from Antarctic glaciers that have varying concentrations of viruses and nutrients, to set up a nutrient-addition experiment to determine how nutrients affect microbial and viral population dynamics. The results will deepen our understanding of how microbial communities in general are shaped by nutrients and viruses and give new insights into the functioning of viruses in extremely cold environments. The researchers will publish their findings in scientific journals and will share their discoveries with K-12 students from rural schools in collaboration with the Pinhead Institute and will connect undergraduate students from under-represented minorities to polar research through participation in the university?s Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics Routes Uplift Research Program. Outreach will be achieved through videos produced and distributed by a professional science communicator. The research advances a National Science Foundation goal of expanding fundamental knowledge of Antarctic systems, biota, and processes by utilizing the unique characteristics of the Antarctic region as a science observing platform. <br/><br/>The Principal Investigators propose an experimental approach to understand how nutrient limitation affects microbial diversity and abundances and their cascading effects on virus diversity, abundance, and mode of infection (lysis vs. lysogeny) in Antarctic cryoconite holes. Cryoconite holes are ideal natural microcosms for manipulative studies, not available in other cryospheric ecosystems.  The PIs will use previously collected cryoconite from across a gradient of both viral diversity and nutrient levels to address questions about key limiting nutrients and microbial-viral community dynamics in cryoconite sediments. Nutrient manipulation experiments will be conducted in a growth chamber that closely approximates the light and temperature regime of in situ cryoconite holes to test three core hypotheses: (1) phosphorus availability limits microbial productivity and abundance in cryoconite holes; (2) relaxing nutrient limitation in cryoconite from low-diversity glaciers will increase species diversity, leading microbial communities to resemble those found on more nutrient-rich glaciers; (3) relaxing nutrient limitation will increase the diversity and abundance of viruses by increasing the availability of suitable hosts, and decrease the prevalence of lysogenic infections.  By manipulating nutrient limitation within a realistic range, this project will help verify hypothesized phosphorus limitation of Antarctic cryoconite holes and will extend understanding of the connections between nutrients, diversity, and viral infection dynamics in the cryosphere more generally. A better understanding of these dynamics in cryoconite sediments improves the ability of scientists to forecast future impacts of environmental changes in the cryosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The central technological innovation that motivates and guides the proposed work is the construction of a Mechanical Atlas, describing the measurement of mechanical stresses, in three dimensions, at single-cell resolution and over time, in a living embryo as it sculpts itself. The investigators will then build on this effort to determine the molecular underpinnings of the observed patterns of stress, and discover rules by which these stressors collectively ensure unique morphogenetic outcomes in ways that are robust with respect to phenotypic and environmental variations. They expect this work will reveal new mechanical design principles for embryonic development, with direct impact on the fields of tissue engineering and organ regeneration.

They threaten large population centers along these coasts with possible tsunamis, and move material from the shallow to the deep sea during margin evolution. Despite their high prevalence on passive margins and in particular, on the U.S. east coast, very little about their causes, mechanical behavior, and frequency is understood, and their role in the development of the passive margin as it exists today has not been examined. This project will collect new seismic data with the R/V Marcus Langseth to examine large submarine landslide behavior over the past 23 million years in a region offshore North Carolina that has experienced large, recent submarine landslides. Sediment cores will be retrieved from the Cape Fear Slide, which is the most recent large submarine landslide in the area and still expressed on the seafloor. The cores will provide insights into pre-conditioning and triggering mechanisms. This study will improve understanding of how slope failures operate through time and the manner in which past events might influence subsequent events, and will provide training and international collaboration opportunities for three graduate students and three early-career scientists.<br/><br/>This project will collect high-resolution multichannel seismic data and piston cores on the continental rise and slope in the vicinity of the Cape Fear submarine landslide offshore North Carolina. These data will be used to examine the interplay between margin topography, fluid and heat flow, pore pressure, and submarine mass transport deposits. Mass transport deposits, bottom-simulating reflections, and stratigraphic sequences in the Cape Fear region will be seismically imaged. The new high-resolution seismic data will be combined with existing seismic and borehole data to interpret number of events, timing, source areas, volumes, areal extent and runout length, and bounding surfaces of mass transport deposits. The seismic data will be used to assess and model internal characteristics of mass transport deposits and surrounding sediments, including deformation style, present-day pore pressure and temperature distribution, and the presence of gas. This project consists of acquiring 3843 km of 2D high-resolution multichannel seismic data, along with bathymetry, subbottom profiler, and water column data. Seven piston and seven gravity cores will be collected in locations associated with seeps or bottom-simulating reflections. Geotechnical and pore fluid chemical analyses will be performed. The processed seismic data will be interpreted for stratigraphic age control, areal extent, and volume of mass transport deposits. Internal deformation of mass transport deposits will be examined through seismic attribute analysis. Sediment physical properties will be derived using full waveform inversion and quantitative models of conditions for failure will be developed.

Hospital and nursing home acquired injuries, especially venous stasis ulcers and pressure sores, can negatively impact a patient?s mental, physical, social, and emotional well-being, in addition to being concerning to immediate family and healthcare providers. Treatment of chronic ulcers in the elderly is mostly palliative, involving application of bandages or dressings, and wounds can require months to years to heal. To date, most potential therapies utilizing vascular or endothelial mitogenic growth factors have not reached the clinically relevant criteria of wound regeneration or closure. Based upon feasibility studies, the Pulsating Electromagnetic Fields (PEMFs) offer the prospect of healing recalcitrant soft tissue wounds, such as chronic bed sores, in a minimally invasive manner. Better understanding of PEMF-induced healing may provide the critical information necessary for understanding the mechanism of action (MOA) and designing appropriate experiments, thus providing an avenue for successful regulatory filings and use as an effective clinical treatment for wound healing. The ability to efficiently stimulate maximal, sustained healing in targeted tissues remains a goal of importance to the field of regenerative medicine and provides a clear opportunity for PEMF therapy.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an effective, low-cost, low-frequency pulsed electromagnetic field (LF-PEMF) generating healing device for home care and nursing home professionals to use in the treatment of chronic ulcers in the elderly.  The LF-PEMF may only require a prescription and a simple patient training session. Different PEMF modalities have been investigated as potential therapeutic tools for promoting tissue repair, including sinusoidal alternating, pulsed electromagnetic, pulsating electric, and rotating magnetic fields. Neww blood vessel growth (a.k.a. angiogenesis) can be stimulated by exposing in vitro cultured human umbilical vein endothelial cells to PEMFs. Physiological activity of exposure to PEMF depends upon the physical parameters of current intensity, magnetic field strength, pulse frequency, and exposure duration. The application of novel LF-PEMFs ?tuned? to initiating/sustaining angiogenesis may result in the ability to clinically treat soft tissue wounds, including chronic skin ulcers. This technology builds upon existing Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-cleared LF-PEMF devices, currently used to promote bone growth in recalcitrant fractures and suggests applications for the use of novel waveform patterns to support soft tissue regeneration, specifically by promoting regeneration through cellular stress response signaling pathways.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

El Nino events provide a useful point of reference for the importance of differential warming over tropical oceans, as the warming of the eastern equatorial Pacific relative to the western Pacific causes disruptions in weather and climate worldwide.  An assessment of future climate impacts over, say, the Southwest US, would have to take into account not only the magnitude of the warming of the tropical oceans but the pattern of the sea surface temperature (SST) increase.  But despite considerable research a clear understanding of what the warming pattern should be and what factors determine it has not yet emerged.  In particular, it is not clear how much the SST difference between the tropics and subtropics will change and wether the warming pattern in the Pacific will look more like El Nino or La Nina (with greater warming in the western Pacific).<br/><br/>Research conducted under this award addresses the warming pattern using a suite of climate model experiments to identify the physical mechanisms that influence the SST warming pattern and its possible evolution over time.  Further work considers the implications of the warming pattern for precipitation changes around the world.  The model simulations are performed through a Model Intercomparison Project (MIP) organized by the Principal Investigator (PI) and involving collaborators at the University of Tokyo, the Alfred Wegener Institute in Germany, National Taiwan University, and the Ulsan National Institute of Science and Technology in South Korea.  The simulations use a hierarchy of model configurations and specialized techniques to isolate mechanisms of interest.  The work is based on an earlier study by the PI and others in which radiative heating by greenhouse gases was applied only in specific latitude bands, with the somewhat unexpected result that off-equatorial heating made a greater contribution to equatorial SST increase than local heating over the equator.  Additional experiments use the ""flux correction"" technique to examine the effect of mean state bias in determining the warming pattern, motivated by concerns that the commonly occurring cold bias in equatorial Pacific SSTs could cause climate models to produce an incorrect warming pattern.<br/><br/>The educational component of this CAREER proposal focuses on the use of graphic art as a tool for climate science communication.  The project convenes a series of workshops for students in local media and graphic arts programs to develop scientific visualizations to explain climate change impacts relevant to Hawai'i.  The visualizations, also known as infographics, are developed in partnership with local K-12 schools to reflect community concerns regarding climate change.  The resulting infographics are distributed throughout schools across the state to help increase science literacy.  Graphic design concepts are also introduced to graduate students in a new climate dynamics class, with the goal of creating publication-quality scientific illustrations.  The infographics workshops serve to introduce climate science concepts to students outside STEM disciplines, many of whom are Native Hawaiians and Pacific Islanders.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key motivator behind these advances is to enhance the support for edge applications, especially video analysis (VA). Yet VA applications are currently not structured to fully leverage those advances. A primary issue is the lack of structured frameworks to develop and run VA applications, which in turn prevents the deployment and optimizations required to take advantage of all that cellular networks (and their edge-cloud hierarchies) have to offer. To tackle this limitation, the proposed work advocates for a re-designed VA software stack that explicitly ties VA operations  and requirements to the resources, interfaces, and vantage points that each platform element in a mobile edge-cloud hierarchy brings. To achieve this goal, the project takes a bottom-up, three-pronged approach that involves (1) developing a new object-oriented query language for VA applications that makes the aforementioned characteristics explicit and observable, (2) leveraging those features to develop a suite of resource-aware optimizations to VA computations that can operate under diverse (and restricted) edge constraints, and (3) designing a novel task placement engine that automatically adapts and operates VA applications across edge-cloud hierarchies.<br/><br/>Owing to the widespread use of VA applications in sectors spanning traffic control, to autonomous vehicles, to disaster relief, the proposed research promises benefits to a large part of the population. The key improvements will come along two axes ? (1) replacing painstaking manual analysis with automatic determination of the appropriate interactions between VA applications and emerging mobile networking infrastructure, and (2) democratizing the use of edge networking infrastructure ? and will target two different groups. On the one hand, the proposed frameworks will simplify the creation of cutting-edge VA applications for developers by automatically deciding what public edge infrastructure to use and how to use it most effectively (in terms of cost, accuracy, and performance). On the other hand, the developed systems will assist network operators in identifying the most fruitful resource enhancements and helpful information about the platform to expose to application elements. The project also involves outreach efforts to attract students from populations currently under-represented in computer science.

The accurate diagnosis of respiratory diseases mandates a measure of blood gases. The determination of blood gases requires an arterial blood sample, an invasive and painful process. This procedure, however, provides only a discrete measurement of respiratory efficacy during a rapidly changing situation. Transcutaneous monitoring is a noninvasive method of continuously measuring oxygen and carbon dioxide diffused through the skin, and any changes they undergo correlate closely with changes in blood gases. The contemporary methodology for measuring transcutaneous oxygen and carbon dioxide requires a heated sensor (that may burn the skin and require frequent alteration of the sensing spot) and a costly non-portable, bulky, corded sensing unit. This project will address a critical unmet need for a cost-effective noninvasive miniaturized wearable device capable of sensing multiple blood gas parameters that provide a comprehensive picture of one?s respiratory status from a home setting. The continuous and remote tracking of vital respiratory parameters will provide relevant and accurate data that alert a caregiver and influence the course of treatment. As the proposed system enables massive longitudinal blood gas data collected in non-clinical settings, clinicians and researchers can remotely assess and measure pulmonary outcomes objectively, and clinicians can further improve the home care management of patients with a fragile respiratory status. The educational program complementing this award will support STEM engagement in schools, provide research opportunities, train students in state-of-the-art circuits and systems, biomedical, and optics, and support the future engineering workforce.<br/><br/><br/>This project will create a first-of-its-kind wearable blood gas monitor for managing the home care of individuals. More specifically, the core scientific contributions will include 1) the creation of a novel miniaturized custom-designed wearable sensor that measures two modalities of blood gases; 2) identification of factors affecting sensor readings such as temperature and drift for the self-calibration of blood gas sensors; 3) the exploration of innovative electronic interfaces for a specialized analog front-end for the proposed unique sensor with heterogeneous decay time, including one with an ultra-fast response; 4) determination of the feasibility and usability of the system during real-life activities in home settings by capturing the dynamic respiratory physiological status of individuals with longitudinal data. Having the ability to sense two vital respiratory parameters (namely, transcutaneous partial pressures of oxygen and carbon dioxide) with one wearable device is unique and superior to the current practice of measuring only oxygen saturation, and fills an important gap in the miniaturization of the transcutaneous blood gas sensor for noninvasive wearable device applications. In addition, the longitudinal new data will enable new biomedical research opportunities to assess therapies and further investigate medical conditions in which oxygen and carbon dioxide play a critical role, including novel respiratory diseases that are not yet fully understood (e.g., COVID-19). Progress on enabling the affordable and scalable remote monitoring of oxygenation and ventilation at home is transformative for prospective medical and scientific research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For instance, data-driven techniques can enable better quality of experience for content distribution over the Internet, better wireless communication techniques, and better attack detection techniques for emerging cybersecurity threats. Unfortunately, a pervasive lack of data limits the potential of data-driven research and development. Data holders are often reluctant to share datasets for fear of revealing business secrets or running afoul of regulations. These data access challenges will become (and already are) a fundamental stumbling block for innovation in next-generation networks.<br/><br/>This project aims to tackle this impasse with synthetic data ?-- data that exhibits the same statistical patterns as real data, without the need to explicitly share the original source data. Synthetic datasets can be safely released to enable cross-stakeholder collaboration. Synthetic data generation techniques, however, have classically suffered from poor data quality. This proposal explores how to leverage and extend recent advances in machine learning to use Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to generate synthetic models of networking datasets. Realizing the potential benefits of GAN-generated synthetic data for networking systems, however, is challenging on multiple fronts. First, network traffic datasets (e.g., packet captures) entail complex relationships that raise new fidelity and scalability implications for prior GAN models. Second, networking use cases pose new (and traditional) privacy requirements, and the resulting privacy-fidelity tradeoffs remain poorly understood. Finally, several networking use cases entail studying rare or extreme events (e.g., outages, flash crowds, attacks). Data for such extreme events by definition is rare and challenging for GANs (or any synthetic data model) to learn. This project will tackle interdisciplinary challenges spanning networking, machine learning, and privacy to develop novel foundations for GAN-enabled workflows for supporting data-driven operations in next-generation network systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, the rising adoption of facial surveillance in public safety and security is a vital factor gaining significant tractions in the market. With the threats to national borders, airports, seaports and public transportation hubs, advanced security systems are in high demand. Surveillance camera videos are often recorded and analyzed automatically. Video face recognition performance has been significantly boosted due to the powerful deep learning models but in the real-world, surveillance cameras provide limited resolution and only capture side-views of the target suspects due to limitations of the environment. Recognition with low-resolution, non-frontal faces remains a challenge. Most existing face recognition algorithms assume high-resolution, near-frontal faces yet cannot provide sufficient performance with low-resolution, side-view images. The proposed technology utilizes multiple aspects of information to conduct a more faithful face identification and recognition, which provides a novel option for security applications.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a multi-cue frontal face restoration system that provides a recognition and identification framework to synthesize identity-preserving, high-resolution frontal face images from low-resolution, side-view faces and a narrative description provided by eyewitnesses. The proposed technology utilizes a series of extreme poses of face images via a super-resolution integrated network to synthesize high-resolution frontalized faces. It aims to recognize low-resolution extreme-pose faces with multiple cues provided by the surveillance system as well as witness descriptions. To improve the discriminative ability of learning representation, intra- and inter-class constraints are imposed to penalize redundant features. Instead of employing naive fusion methods, orthogonal regularization is used in a generative model for optimal training and to learn a comprehensive representation of broader spans. Eyewitnesses may provide narrative description of the face that is fed into a language encoder and converted to attribute-level representations. A description-guided face editing network with spatial constraints enables the ability of editing both attribute-level and geometric contents of input images by leveraging transformer-based language encoder for image translation. The face editing network takes the encoded features and modifies the frontalized faces with various attributes to generate refined frontal faces for high fidelity image matching.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Magnetic reconnection is a ubiquitous process throughout the Universe, which rearranges the topology of the magnetic fields which bind plasmas, and converts magnetic energy to kinetic and thermal energy. In environments with strong radiative cooling, such as around pulsars or in the coronae of black holes, efficient radiative loss may strongly effect the plasma dynamics leading to radiative cooling instabilities. Understanding this radiative collapse process is an outstanding issue in theory, simulation, experiment, and observation of magnetic reconnection under extreme conditions.<br/><br/>The experiments supported by this award will use the largest pulsed-power facility in the world, the Z machine at Sandia National Laboratories, to open up a new frontier in fundamental laboratory astrophysics: strongly radiatively cooled magnetic reconnection.

These plasmas are inherently in rough equipartition, with significant contributions to the pressure balance from the magnetic, thermal and kinetic pressures, a situation which occurs in many astrophysical plasmas. The research team will scale this platform from 1 MA peak current, university scale facilities to the Z machine which drives over 25 MA of current.

Initially, the synthetic mucus will be explored as anti-aging, moisturizing skincare ingredients, and will replace natural mucins derived from animals. Importantly, the synthetic methods may allow for the synthesis of diverse mucin analogs, with varying material and biological properties. Following the development of synthetic mucins for skincare, the team will develop materials for transdermal delivery, biocompatible lubrication, and surgical adhesives. The synthetic analogs of mucus can aid in understanding the role of mucus in digestive, respiratory, and immune systems. The additional broader impacts include launching a new US-based, high-tech material manufacturing company, creating new markets for mucins, and providing nontoxic skincare, healthcare, and biomedical solutions, where no other adequate alternative exists.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of synthetic materials that mimic the structures and properties of animal mucus. Animals secrete different mucus for a variety of functions, including lubrication, hydration, and adhesion. The team has recently developed a synthetic analog of snail mucin that is a substitute for the snail mucus filtrate currently used in hydrating skincare products. The synthetic mucin is a water-soluble glycosylated polypeptide that can be produced on the kilogram scale. Currently, synthetic mucins are only produced on the milligram scale or have chemical compositions that do not fully mimic the composition or properties of the natural mucins. The proposed technology reresenets a scalable synthesis of a glycosylated polypeptide that re-creates all the salient structural and physical characteristics of snail mucins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous studies in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica suggest that viral infections of microbes, and a general lack of fertilizers (i.e., nutrients), may be important factors shaping the development and functioning of microbial communities in cryoconite holes.  The researchers propose an experimental approach to understand how nutrient limitation affects diversity (number of species) and overall abundance of microbes, and how the diversity and abundance of microbes in turn affects the diversity, abundance, and infection type of viruses that parasitize the microbes in cryoconite sediments.  The researchers will use sediments previously collected from Antarctic glaciers that have varying concentrations of viruses and nutrients, to set up a nutrient-addition experiment to determine how nutrients affect microbial and viral population dynamics. The results will deepen our understanding of how microbial communities in general are shaped by nutrients and viruses and give new insights into the functioning of viruses in extremely cold environments. The researchers will publish their findings in scientific journals and will share their discoveries with K-12 students from rural schools in collaboration with the Pinhead Institute and will connect undergraduate students from under-represented minorities to polar research through participation in the university?s Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics Routes Uplift Research Program. Outreach will be achieved through videos produced and distributed by a professional science communicator. The research advances a National Science Foundation goal of expanding fundamental knowledge of Antarctic systems, biota, and processes by utilizing the unique characteristics of the Antarctic region as a science observing platform. <br/><br/>The Principal Investigators propose an experimental approach to understand how nutrient limitation affects microbial diversity and abundances and their cascading effects on virus diversity, abundance, and mode of infection (lysis vs. lysogeny) in Antarctic cryoconite holes. Cryoconite holes are ideal natural microcosms for manipulative studies, not available in other cryospheric ecosystems.  The PIs will use previously collected cryoconite from across a gradient of both viral diversity and nutrient levels to address questions about key limiting nutrients and microbial-viral community dynamics in cryoconite sediments. Nutrient manipulation experiments will be conducted in a growth chamber that closely approximates the light and temperature regime of in situ cryoconite holes to test three core hypotheses: (1) phosphorus availability limits microbial productivity and abundance in cryoconite holes; (2) relaxing nutrient limitation in cryoconite from low-diversity glaciers will increase species diversity, leading microbial communities to resemble those found on more nutrient-rich glaciers; (3) relaxing nutrient limitation will increase the diversity and abundance of viruses by increasing the availability of suitable hosts, and decrease the prevalence of lysogenic infections.  By manipulating nutrient limitation within a realistic range, this project will help verify hypothesized phosphorus limitation of Antarctic cryoconite holes and will extend understanding of the connections between nutrients, diversity, and viral infection dynamics in the cryosphere more generally. A better understanding of these dynamics in cryoconite sediments improves the ability of scientists to forecast future impacts of environmental changes in the cryosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This CAREER project aims to explore the beliefs, experiences, educational training, and research that supports the development of effective engineering education leaders who are assuming roles focused on diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI). Advancing equity and broadening the participation of historically marginalized populations in engineering remain a priority for sustaining U.S. global leadership and economic progress. DEI initiatives, programs, and research are increasing in number across the country in an effort to better understand and dismantle the challenges. However, many DEI efforts are developed in isolation and are not supported by strong institutional commitment and policy. Results from this work will advance understanding of DEI issues, approaches, and effective institutional implementation and will prepare the next generation of DEI leaders to promote long-term, sustainable racial equity initiatives.<br/><br/>Three primary objectives guide this research effort. First, is to understand DEI leaders? perceptions, knowledge, and challenges around their roles. Second is to examine the extent to which those perceptions compare and contrast with graduate students and early career faculty members from groups who have been historically underrepresented in their participation in STEM fields of study. Third, is to develop training and faculty development programs to prepare the next generation of DEI leaders. Data will be collected in the first phase of the project by conducting interviews with DEI leaders at multiple institutions and contrasting their experiences with a document analysis of institutional DEI programs, policies, awards, and incentives. In a subsequent phase the project will use a survey, based on results from phase one, to examine the beliefs and practices of engineering faculty members and graduate students from groups historically marginalized in engineering. Training and faculty development are the focus of phase three, which includes the preparation of senior PhD students and early-career faculty members in engineering not only for DEI positions, but also for research, teaching, mentoring, and enhancing student understanding of DEI issues.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Innovations in Graduate Education (IGE) program, with the support of the NSF Racial Equity Program Description.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to serve the national interest by creating and testing tools to improve student success in introductory programming courses. Programming courses usually require students to practice by writing complete programs. However, this can be very difficult for students who are new to programming. Struggling while writing code can increase the risk that students will fail a course or leave the field. This project will help students succeed in writing complete programs by providing them with a hint in the form of a mixed-up code problem. In these problems, students place mixed-up blocks of code in the correct order. Prior research has shown that students solve these problems faster than writing complete programs and yet still learn a similar amount. This project will automatically generate two types of mixed-up code problems from student-written code: (1) a problem based on the most common student-written solution, and (2) a personalized problem based on a student's incorrect solution. <br/><br/>The goals of this project are to investigate the effects of two types of mixed-up code problems, also called Parsons problems, with respect to student perceptions, learning gains, efficiency, problem completion rates, self-efficacy, and retention. Methods include think-aloud within-subjects studies, between subject studies, and surveys. Effects will be tested in multiple educational contexts: an undergraduate Python course, an online Python course, programs to help secondary students succeed, an undergraduate Java course, and a high-school level Java course. The tools and generated problems will be integrated into Runestone, an open-source ebook platform that is already used by hundreds of institutions and tens of thousands of students. Research results will be disseminated via blogs, conference papers, and workshops for computing instructors. This project will add new knowledge in the effort to scaffold learning for students who are struggling while writing complete programs. Techniques used in this project, if successful, could be used in other STEM subjects to improve success and retention rates.

The salient feature of the work is the identification of novel disconnections that lead to rapid and controlled preparation of desired molecular structures in as few chemical steps as possible. In pursuit of this goal, several underexplored chemical processes are being evaluated and developed into general methods to improve the ability to efficiently synthesize compounds with varying levels of structural complexity. The results of these studies will have a positive impact across many different fields of applied molecular sciences, including agrochemicals, pharmaceuticals, and materials science. Moreover, the project is conceptually interesting and has many potential applications, making it well suited for the education of scientists at all levels. This grant will also enable wide-ranging science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM)-focused outreach activities. The broader impacts of this work include the research training of undergraduate and graduate students at the forefront of synthesis.  Moreover, the Sarlah group has been leading an outreach program, Science in Action (SIA), that provides crucial hands-on science education in the greater Champaign, IL area. Through the SIA program, several research groups in the department, in collaboration with local teachers, are bringing science experiences to children and younger students.<br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this proposal is the development of several strategies for the rapid and controlled construction of different types of complex natural products. By exploring transition metal-catalyzed cyclizations and cycloisomerizations, a range of terpenoid-based structures the Sarlah group is working to streamline access to these natural product core structures and do so in a highly stereodivergent manner. These intermediates will serve as late-stage templates for final elaboration to a diverse set of natural products, ranging from triterpenoids, merosesquiterpenes, and indolosesquiterpenes, many of which have notable biological properties. As part of these studies, the team is working to leverage an underutilized nickel-catalyzed annulation to access a structurally unique class of norcembranoids.

Search engines and online social networks provide powerful targeting technologies for advertisers to deliver their messages to specific end users. These technologies help users see more relevant ads, yet raise privacy concerns. Targeted ads impact people's lives in a variety of ways, such as what employment, housing, and credit opportunities they may encounter. Platforms have recently started making transparent to researchers and end-users more data about advertisements. Despite these efforts, initial studies have found significant shortcomings in current transparency mechanisms, necessitating improved methodologies. This project seeks to better understand current transparency mechanisms, develop new methods for collecting transparency data, and design new mechanisms that make transparency more useful to researchers, journalists, civil-society groups, and end-users, ultimately increasing end users' trust in targeted advertising.<br/><br/>The research has three key tasks. First, the researchers are mapping the current space of advertising transparency, developing a taxonomy of transparency mechanisms, and conducting user studies to evaluate these mechanisms' utility both for end-users and third-party auditors. Second, transparency is currently implemented very differently by various social media platforms, and the data made available are often not directly suitable for large-scale empirical research. The researchers are developing methodologies to layer additional data on top of platforms' sources of transparency data to extend transparency and standardize data across platforms. Third, the researchers are applying user-centered design practices to develop and evaluate a suite of new ad transparency mechanisms and user interfaces designed for multiple stakeholders: end-users, civil-society groups, and journalists.

Deciding whether to hold the door open for the next person, let someone merge ahead in traffic, or take the last crab at a crab feast are all everyday scenarios that could depend on how fair one has been previously. Multiple rounds of fairness also occur both experimentally in the lab and naturally in the field in higher stakes and economically relevant environments. Managers must decide on bonuses among subordinates (and potentially themselves), and these decisions may or may not depend on their past bonus decisions. In professional baseball, unwritten rules dictate when players should ?take a pitch? to help the other team, despite potentially losing hundreds of thousands of dollars in incentives. This project will examine the features of such dynamic fairness concerns using a laboratory experiment. In addition to testing dynamic fairness concerns, we also examine the methodological issue of payment in relevant experimental settings. When subjects are repeatedly asked questions to provide more data, a common cost-saving measure in laboratory experiments is to randomly choose one decision problem for payment. The reliability of this method, while commonly used, is dependent on a subject?s dynamic fairness concerns. The standard analysis assumes that there are no dynamics: each choice problem is viewed in isolation. When the experimenter does not know a subject?s concerns, assuming isolation could give rise to incorrect conclusions about that subject?s preferences. Therefore, this project will also investigate payment methodology?s robustness in terms of experimental design on fairness.<br/><br/>This research contributes threefold to the bodies of literature in social preferences under risk and experimental methodology by using the simplest way to better understand: (i) how individuals make choices in a specific dynamic fairness settings, (ii) which theoretical model(s) of social preference under risk best represent actual data, and (iii) how much of a role isolation plays in social preference experiments. This project will experimentally test the presence of non-isolation in a two-round experiment using the aforementioned ?random problem selection? (RPS) payment mechanism. Each round will be a binary outcome dictator game, where a subject will choose one of two options to split a share of money between themselves and another anonymous subject. In particular, this experiment asks whether having previously chosen a fair (resp. unfair) alternative outcome creates a tendency to choose an unfair (resp. fair) outcome for the next round. This type of dynamic response is labeled a ?choice reversal?, and it identifies non-isolation. However, the dynamic nature of the experiment inevitably induces selection bias. To overcome this challenge, the experiment uses a procedure with possible early resolution of the RPS scheme, which can shut down the effect of RPS in later choice while inducing subject?s choice under RPS for earlier choice. Therefore, the subject's choice in later rounds will not be affected probabilistically from their earlier round choice, which can then be compared to the control group. Note that non-isolation and reversals are two separate concepts: subjects who do not isolate the problem do not necessarily give rise to reversals. Therefore, the focus will be to jointly test the existence of non-isolation and reversal behavior. Simultaneously, the parameters of the experiment are chosen to distinguish between three classes of models of social preferences under risk. Dynamic fairness concerns are important factors in economically-relevant individual decision-making problems and their respective welfare analyses. This research's fundamental contributions to understanding these concerns will advise both applied and theoretical economists on appropriate model selection. For the experimental economist, this research will provide insight into the applicability of the common RPS payment mechanism in such dynamic settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding how plasma interacts with neutral elements in the atmospheres around the Sun and Earth is important for space weather modeling and prediction. For instance, predicting satellite drag requires knowledge of the density of Earth's thermosphere, which is modified by solar radiation and ions from solar wind. Yet, space weather models sometimes ignore the effects of plasma-neutral interactions or rely on dated models developed using simple experiments. This project will undertake a pioneering laboratory investigation of collisions in plasmas, develop new models for plasma-neutral interaction, and fold them into state-of-the-art space weather models. The team will also create science kits with hands-on activities and instructional materials and distribute them to every elementary school in 21 counties in West Virginia. The project is a collaborative effort between West Virginia University, University of Texas at Arlington, Bay Area Environmental Research Institute, Electric Power Research Institute and Spark! Imagination and Science Center in West Virginia.<br/><br/>Understanding ion-neutral interactions is important for modeling magnetosphere/ionosphere/thermosphere coupling and the dynamics of the solar chromosphere, which influence space weather. Ion-neutral collision frequency plays a critical role for both Joule heating and ionospheric and chromospheric (ambipolar) conductivity. The project team will conduct a multi-fluid, multi-species laboratory study of ion-neutral coupling, develop a new model for collision frequency for the terrestrial ionosphere, and incorporate ion-neutral coupling in a chromosphere simulation model. The newly developed collision frequency model will be incorporated into the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model and the Space Weather Modeling Framework and validated using space-based observations. Wider scientific community participation in this work will be encouraged through two workshops. The research and educational activities will involve postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students.

But operating at higher frequencies has many shortcomings, namely higher loss in the channel, and more opportunity for blockages and other impairments to the connection. Additionally, the extremely high frequency of the data modulation requires novel signal processing techniques due to the infeasibility and energy expense of digitizing signals at such high speeds. To overcome these limits, a proposed analog approach that divide and conquer the frequency bands to save power and to make the systems feasible for mobile applications will be pursued. Taking advantage of the fact that transmission is accomplished with a large array of antennas, rather than a single high-power transmitter, can lead to energy savings and interference reduction by dividing the transmissions to various antennas to cause less inter-user interference. Finally, the resilience of such communication systems can be improved by incorporating more dense networks, which can form so-called mesh networks, which allows multiple paths from source to destination, which is needed when one path is lost due to blockages or other impairments. Such mesh networks also potentially increase interference and noise in the network, the directional nature of the transmissions can be utilized to realize a hierarchical mesh system. To test these ideas, a mm-wave testbed will be upgraded to support these experiments.<br/><br/>The proposed goal is to increase the resilience of mm-wave networks both at the circuit and system level for 6G/NextG networks. At the circuit level, high throughput can be achieved by utilizing multiple carriers and efficient architectures for circuit building blocks that can simultaneously modulate/demodulate a large swath of bandwidth over an aggregation of non-contiguous sub-bands, similar to OFDM and OFDM-A, but using mixed-signal and analog techniques to reduce requirements on ADCs, DACs, and DSP. The main innovations are in increasing the bandwidth in the circuitry and exploiting system level innovations at the circuit architecture level to improve performance metrics, in particular noise, impact of phase noise, quantization noise, and output power and efficiency. The techniques proposed can help alleviate path loss, signal blockage, and beam tracking with minimal energy consumption. The benefits will be most pronounced when building large-scale NextG MIMO beamforming systems. Our systems research vector focuses on building robust and rapidly adaptable NextG networks by utilization of spatial mesh networking. By utilizing more degrees of freedom, in particular a wider channel bandwidth, and multiple carriers, the network can be further optimized for reliability and resilience. Frequency dependent beamforming, frequency selective fading, and many other channel impairments can be handled more easily in the frequency domain. However, OFDM modulation of a 30 GHz wide-band channel is not practical, instead mixed-signal techniques that can garner most of the benefits of a fully digital solution will be explored. Interference aware array transmitters will minimize inter-user interference by exploiting redundancies in the array. The proposed ideas will be tested both with integrated circuit prototypes and by demonstration using an upgraded mm-wave (E-band) MIMO testbed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Specifically, this project will organize the 2023 Annual Gulf States Math Alliance (GSMATH) Conference and offer a faculty development workshop to support the use of collaborative mentoring strategies by mathematics faculty at participating institutions. The GSMATH Conference will be held at Texas Southern University in Houston, Texas during February 24-26, 2023.  The conference is organized by GSMATH, which is the regional mathematics alliance covering the states of Texas, Louisiana, and Mississippi that includes an active and strong network of faculty mentors in over 25 HSIs (Hispanic Serving Institutions), HBCUs (Historically Black Colleges and Universities), and other institutions that serve a diverse population of students. Building from six prior GSMATH conferences, it is anticipated that 125 students will attend the conference with an additional 25 faculty also participating in the faculty development workshop. The conference will provide multiple sessions centered on demystifying the pathways through undergraduate degree programs in the mathematical sciences.  Keynote speakers, panel discussions, a student poster session, and a graduate and undergraduate program fair will provide multiple opportunities for students to network, ask questions, and receive mentoring.  The faculty workshop will focus on equitably supporting students as they grow from 2-year and 4-year colleges into graduate education or the workforce.  <br/><br/>The GSMATH conference will directly contribute to efforts to broaden participation and promote equity in the mathematical sciences. This, in turn, has potential to improve STEM education and academic outcomes for students across disciplines. Panels like ?What I wish I knew Before Graduate School?, ?Math Career Pathways (Academic and Non-Academic)"", and ?Research Opportunities for Undergraduate Majors? will allow participating students to get advice from faculty and experienced peers. The involvement of community college mathematics faculty and students is a critical element of the GSMATH conference, as 2-year colleges are a starting point for many students pursuing bachelor?s and graduate degrees in the mathematical sciences. The faculty development workshop will not only enable faculty to collaboratively mentor those students throughout the year but will also address important issues in DEI (Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion), critical transition from CCs to four-year undergraduate studies, and from undergraduate to graduate studies. Faculty development will also strengthen connections between participating institutions, supporting the growth of a responsive community of mentors across the discipline. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of the HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research (i) on engaged student learning, (ii) about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, and (iii) that improves our understanding of how to build institutional capacity at HSIs are supported by this program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time, machine learning (ML), including deep learning (DL), is quickly gaining popularity for solving complex problems. Like typical software, ML applications also require many iterations to improve software quality. However, iterative ML application-development processes face higher-level difficulties in adopting CI in three aspects. First, developers lack systematic understanding for managing ML data, models and code in the CI workflow. For ML-based systems, the process to define the CI workflow is currently much more experimental in nature. Second, existing CI systems are lacking in the handling of ML-centric challenges such as defining evaluation conditions of ML models, formulating complicated build steps, long build and integration time, etc. For ML applications, the build process is much more complicated due to the complex dependency of data, model, code, etc. Third, data scientists lack the technical support to adopt and maintain CI configurations due to complex interconnections among data, model, code, etc. and the changing nature of the ML applications. For data scientists with limited or no knowledge of CI, it becomes increasingly difficult to adopt CI for ML applications, and even if adopted it requires too much manual effort. <br/><br/>The project will make progress in acquiring knowledge on the feasibility and effectiveness of the current adoption of CI for ML applications. This will assist in understanding the workflow of CI for ML applications and identifying improvement scopes. Moreover, the project will develop a novel CI profiling framework to generate a dependency graph among heterogeneous artifacts (e.g., data, model, code, etc.) of ML applications.

Renewable energy and an increase in extreme weather lead to more power supply variability. At the same time, fluctuating data center utilization caused by user churn increases power demand variability. Power demand and supply have to be kept in balance at increasingly short timescales and resiliency of data centers to power events is paramount for their availability. This project's goal is to build and evaluate a data center power control plane (PCP). PCP can control power demand at a fine granularity and over short timescales by making it software-defined. The key is to gracefully trade off power and quality of service over time. This allows PCP to shed or consolidate load to conserve power during a power event. PCP aims to reduce recovery latency from power disasters, outlive power disruptions, and improve the energy efficiency of next-generation data centers via power oversubscription. Several research questions  are addressed to make PCP practical, such as how to scale power demand and supply instrumentation and control; how to leverage the diverse power envelopes of various processing devices available in a data center; how to determine sheddable load, and how to control it transparently; how to further reduce fail-over and recovery latency from power outages?<br/><br/>Next-generation data centers will provide time and life-critical services to a large portion of society globally. By providing power resiliency, this project has the potential to dramatically improve next-generation service availability, to enable critical services, and to avert power disasters to save lives, reduce the blast radius of a power emergency, and constrain the cost of a power disaster.

In Early Jurassic, the Atlantic Ocean began to form as the continental margin of the southeastern United States rifted from northwest Africa. Rifting occurred by mechanical stretching of the crust and lithosphere, potentially with extensive heating and volcanism, before the Mid-Atlantic Ridge started to accommodate extension by seafloor spreading. Old fault lines and sutures of the Appalachian basement may have been reactivated during this continental stretching phase, and lava flows may have filled the early rift basin. Whether this episode of volcanism was a cause or consequence of the breakup between North America and Africa is not yet clear. This question can be addressed with new marine geophysical data that will cover parts of the margin from the continental shelf to the adjacent abyssal plain, a distance of approximately 400 km. With seismic images of the deep sediments and basement, scientists can determine the relationship between basement faults and lava flows on the Carolina Trough, along the coast of the Carolinas, and Blake Plateau, farther south along Georgia and Florida. These two sections of the Atlantic continental margin are of particular interest because the Blake Plateau is much wider than the Carolina Trough. Either the Blake Plateau forms a block of continental crust that did not stretch much during continental rifting, or it is a plateau that largely consists of volcanic rock that formed during rupture of the supercontinent Pangea. The marine geophysical expedition will involve two vessels, the R/V Marcus Langseth and the R/V Neil Armstrong, and ocean-bottom seismometers that will be used to record seismic waves to map subseafloor basement structure. The investigating team will invite students and early-career scientists from other universities to participate in the expedition, and two short courses will be organized to engage early-career scientists in the analysis and interpretation of the data. Although this study focuses on the southeastern United States margin, results will inform ongoing and future studies at other continental margins worldwide.   <br/><br/><br/>The asthenosphere beneath continental rifts can produce large volumes of melt in the presence of deep-seated thermal anomalies, or due to decompression beneath thinning lithosphere. The interactions between lithospheric plate extension and the generation and delivery of magma in this setting are not yet well known. The team of scientists will conduct an active-source seismic investigation of the rifted margins of the southeastern United States to better understand the feedbacks between tectonic extension and magmatism during continental breakup and the onset of seafloor spreading in the central Atlantic Ocean. The continental margin of Blake Plateau is much wider than the adjacent margin of Carolina Trough to the north, suggesting that extension and rupture of continental lithosphere progressed differently at these two adjoining rift segments. Differences in mantle temperature anomalies, mantle melting, and structural inheritance of the continental lithosphere may all have influenced these two contrasting styles of rifting. The investigators seek to address the following three hypotheses: 1) The Blake Plateau Basin stretched much wider than the Carolina Trough Basin before breakup due to a difference in lithospheric thickness. 2) During rifting, the magma supply kept pace with extension of Blake Plateau crust, whereas the continental crust rapidly thinned without extensive magmatism beneath the southern Carolina Trough. 3) At the time of rifting, the deep mantle beneath the Blake Plateau was significantly hotter than the mantle beneath Carolina Trough, which would affect the lithospheric rheology, and the degree of mantle melting. To assess how rift-related processes affected crustal structure and sediment stratigraphy, the science team will gather approximately 4500 km of 2-D seismic reflection data and 900 km of ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) refraction data with the R/V Marcus Langseth. During this expedition, 39 OBSs from the national Instrument Center (OBSIC) will be deployed with the R/V Neil Armstrong. Images of seismic velocity and reflectivity will provide new insights into the sediment stratigraphy, the geometry of basalt flows and crustal-scale faults, and the thickness and composition of igneous crust. The active-source seismic data and geochemical analyses of existing basalt samples will be used to infer past deformation and the emplacement of intrusive and extrusive crust at the Carolina Trough and Blake Plateau. Students and early-career scientists from other US institutions will be invited to engage in the acquisition and analysis of marine seismic reflection and refraction data on the R/V Neil Armstrong or R/V Marcus Langseth. These sea-going participants will obtain experience in the acquisition and on-board processing of seismic reflection and refraction data. In addition, two week-long short courses on OBS refraction data analysis and on processing of multichannel seismic (MCS) reflection data from this project will help train the participants in the use of these new seismic data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is a problem of fundamental importance in mathematical physics, with a wide range of applications: from gas and galactic dynamics to social networks, and from solid state physics and plasma theory to water waves and oceanography. With the size of the systems of interacting particles or waves being large, a deterministic description of their behavior is not feasible, and it is necessary to resort, via a branch of mathematics called kinetic theory, to an averaging description. In this context, the investigator aims to develop analytical and computational tools to describe the properties of such systems by means of averaging quantities and provide a statistically accurate prediction of their evolution in time. The project will offer training and mentoring opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/> <br/>The idea behind kinetic theory is to identify macroscopic properties of a large system and to study their asymptotic behavior as the size of the system tends to infinity, with the intent of finding limiting effective equations, which in turn will reveal properties observed in a system of large but finite size. In the case of interacting particles, this is achieved by the Boltzmann equation, in wave turbulence theory by the wave kinetic equation. This project will expand this program to include: the derivation and analysis of kinetic equations for phenomena not covered by Boltzmann equation, for instance multiple particle interactions in non-ideal gases or mixture of gases, the derivation of wave kinetic equations in the inhomogeneous setting, as well addressing the question of local and global well-posedness in wave turbulence theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Several applications can benefit from the underlying constructs developed in this work, including indoor navigation and guidance systems, localization and navigation for autonomous agents in complex indoor spaces, tracking movements of robotic arms for accurate task completion as well as for compliance, and protection of valuables through intrusion monitoring and alarm systems. Thus, the fundamental work in this project is expected to impact several industries and advance mobile computing using wireless technology for localization and sensing.<br/><br/>This research will advance the state-of-the-art in wireless localization and sensing through novel algorithmic and architectural contributions leading to new protocols based on ultra-wideband (UWB) radio technology. This work comprises three research thrusts. In the first, it proposes to enable an infinitely scalable indoor localization technology that can span large indoor spaces, such as shopping malls, museums, government buildings, etc. using only a few UWB anchor devices. An unlimited number of users can derive their own location inside provisioned indoor spaces using UWB receivers that overhear signals sent by installed anchor devices, without transmitting any UWB signal, thereby ensuring their privacy. In the second research thrust, a fine-grained 3D localization idea is proposed which exploits specific channel patterns obtained using multiple antennas at a receiver. The phase of the received wireless signals is compared to provide fine-grained localization of objects or robotic arms in a relatively small space. Such a system can track exact robotic movements without using cameras, a significant advantage when operating in dark, dusty environments, and when the large amount of data produced and processing needs of cameras are not desirable. In the third research thrust, an intrusion detection system is proposed which monitors a protected space by analyzing disturbances in the wireless channel impulse response (CIR). The proposed system would allow friendly entities to freely occupy an indoor space and yet monitor it for intrusions by ignoring CIR disturbances in the vicinity of the friendly entity. Overall, a rich ecosystem of new applications is expected to be enabled by this work.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding timescales for chemical changes will provide insights into magma systems that feed volcanic eruptions. This project will focus on the question of whether the chemistry of volcanic systems in subduction zones can change on timescales less than 100,000 years. In order to answer this question, this project will investigate a sequence of volcanic ash derived from volcanoes that erupted along the west coast of the US over 65 million years ago and was deposited in west Texas over a 7-million-year period. Major goals of the project include creating a high-resolution record of volcanic composition to better understand how and why volcanism changes over time. In addition to filling important gaps in current understanding about volcanoes and magmatic systems, this project will also have implications for understanding the generation of strategic natural resources that will be critical for the energy transition to from hydrocarbons to a more renewable energy base. In particular, insights into copper and lithium deposits may arise from this project. Part of this project will also involve developing a course on the science, economics, and policy of natural resources, which will help educate earth scientists on the natural resources necessary for the energy transition. <br/><br/>Continental arc volcanism generates a wide diversity of magma compositions, but the tempos of compositional variation are unclear. Understanding how the average composition of arc magmas varies in space and time may provide insights into the physics of the transcrustal magmatic system in arc settings. This project focuses on the fundamental question of whether the composition of a magmatic arc can systematically change on timescales of less than 10-100 kyr. A high-resolution record of ash that has been altered into bentonite will enable reconstruction of a detailed history of arc composition. Four major goals will contribute to answering this question. The first goal is to examine diagenetic signals in bentonites in order to assess elemental mobility during bentonite formation. The second goal involves reconstructing ash protolith compositions from the altered bentonites in order to create a record of arc composition over time. A third goal is to analyze volcanic minerals for additional petrogenetic signals to inform about magmatic processes. Results from these first three goals will enable models of how magmatic flux, erosion, tectonism, and crustal thickness influence timescales and processes of transcrustal magma and heat transfer. Methods will include using ?XRF for compositional mapping of bentonites, ICPMS for trace element analyses of bentonites, and EPMA analyses of volcanic mineral compositions. In addition to addressing the fundamental question, this project will also have implications for understanding natural resources such as Li and Cu, for understanding surface and depositional processes, and for understanding the biogeochemical and environmental impacts of volcanic ash.

Manipulation of photons that require special transparent single crystals is inherently much more difficult, making integrated optics a persistent challenge vs. that of electrons that flow readily through any conducting wire. This industry-university collaborative project advances new fabrication methods for realizing optically active single crystal architecture in glass suitable for practical devices, while educating doctoral students through a novel Pasteur Partners PhD (P3) model. These students pursue use-inspired multidisciplinary research co-advised by a faculty and a company scientist, and acquire essential skills for successful careers in industry, academia, national labs, etc.   <br/><br/>TECHNICAL DETAILS: A working integrated ?micro-optics chip? would not be complete without optically active elements that are also accessible to receive an electrical signal. Such elements need to be high quality electro-optic single crystals incorporated within a circuit of waveguides. This project builds on the successful demonstration of ferroelectric single crystal architecture in glass (SCAG) which is constructed in 3D using femtosecond lasers. However, the optical loss of such SCAG waveguides has been too high. Often the SCAG formation is accompanied by a redistribution of elements between glass and crystal. Also, the lattice of SCAG is modified by the stresses resulting from change in density at the growth front during crystallization. Through a fundamental understanding of these features of crystal growth under the confinement by the surrounding glass, this project is reducing optical loss by creating a graded refractive index profile within the crystal. The desired variation of refractive index is introduced through dynamic control of temperature by a laser beam of appropriate intensity profile.

Atomically detailed simulations provide exquisite insight into molecular structure, dynamics, and interactions. However, due to their computational cost, atomically detailed simulations can only effectively investigate very small length- and time-scales. In contrast, by eliminating unnecessary atomic details, coarse-grained (CG) model promise the necessary efficiency for simulating many processes of fundamental and technological significance that are far beyond the scope of atomically detailed models, e.g., the mechanisms by which viruses invade host cells or the phase behavior of industrially important polymers. Unfortunately, existing CG models provide a relatively poor description of thermodynamic properties. Moreover, CG models often demonstrate poor transferability, i.e., they require reparameterization for each system and environment of interest. These fundamental limitations severely curtail the predictive powers of current CG models. William Noid and his research group will derive, implement, and assess both theory and computational methods for ensuring that CG models are not only efficient, but also provide predictive accuracy and transferability for modeling soft materials, such as liquids and biomolecules. In addition, William Noid will continue developing an intergenerational science club that engages students of all ages in scientific discourse and discovery. <br/><br/>	William Noid and his research group will develop rigorous theory and robust computational methods for addressing fundamental limitations of bottom-up CG models. Noid and his research group will analyze the many-body potential of mean force (PMF) to reveal fundamental insight and derive practical approaches for improving both the transferability and the thermodynamic properties of bottom-up models. The resulting insight will inform a dual approach for addressing the density-dependence of CG pair potentials, as well as the temperature-and composition-dependence of many-body local density potentials. Noid and his research group will also investigate the dual approach for describing the thermodynamic driving forces for self-assembly with CG models. Noid and his research group will investigate the influence of the CG mapping upon the exact PMF and upon the properties of approximate CG models. Noid and his group will develop and distribute software for implementing these methods as part of the Bottom-up Open-source Coarse-graining Software (BOCS) package. Noid will provide mentorship and rigorous training for graduate students. Moreover, Noid and his group will develop an intergenerational science club that integrates local senior citizens, emeritus faculty, and undergraduate students in order to build bridges between the academic and civic communities, educate the public about contemporary scientific topics, share the joy of scientific discovery, and promote a healthy lifestyle of life-long learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

NSF-supported computational cyberinfrastructure (CI) has been highly successful in advancing science and engineering over the last few decades. The use of CI has become ubiquitous in research, from traditional fields such as bioinformatics, computational chemistry and astrophysics, to new areas including text interpretation, visual arts and other humanities. This shift is not only happening in large research labs at major institutions, but also increasingly at smaller institutions where researchers are also looking to make use of CI resources. Along with that success, there have been significant changes to the makeup and size of the user community, improvements to the underlying compute, storage, and networking platforms used, and radically different methods by which researchers and CI professionals communicate. These changes require a rethinking of the role of user support services and how they are delivered. To address this, MATCH proposes a new model for implementing user support services that will encourage cost-effective, scalable support that can reach a broader community. The MATCH project develops new approaches, content, services, technologies, and expertise to make it easier for NSF CI users to find and utilize the specific level and type of support needed to effectively carry out their research. With this strategy, the MATCH project expands the reach and impact of NSF CI, serving both traditional and new members of the research computing and data community.<br/><br/>The MATCH approach comprises three major themes: (1) leverage modern information delivery systems to simplify user interfaces; (2) leverage experts from the community to develop training materials and instructions that can dramatically reduce the user learning curve for several increasingly important CI computational techniques; and (3) employ a matchmaking service that will maintain a database of specialist mentors and student mentees that can be matched with projects to provide the domain-specific expertise needed to leverage ACCESS resources. Specifically, MATCH employs a new ACCESS MATCH Portal (AMP) that will serve as the single front door for end users to obtain guided support and assistance. Expert-monitored Q&A platforms will ensure user questions are accurately answered and addressed in a timely fashion, and easy-to use user interfaces such as Open OnDemand and Pegasus will be enhanced and improved to further simplify CI use and provide context directed help when problems are encountered. The system matches community experts with user needs to create documentation and other training materials or provides personal interactions that address the current real world needs of ACCESS users. By restructuring end user support, MATCH creates a multi-level infrastructure capable of scaling to assist a growing research community with increasingly specialized support needs, enabling new discoveries at the forefront of science and society.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to transport and store mRNA-based pharmaceuticals without ultra-cold requirements may significantly lower the costs of distribution of mRNA drugs and vaccines. Also, elimination of the requirements for ultra-freezer and lyophilization will greatly increase the capacity and speed of deployment of mRNA pharmaceuticals as well as their accessibility to remote areas. Finally, the superior thermostability of the new mRNA formulations may reduce the wastage of drugs/vaccines caused by unexpected exposure to elevated temperature during transportation and storage.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of two methods for preparing thermostable liquid formulations of mRNA and mRNA-Lipid Nano-Particles (LNPs), respectively. The first method is to prepare an emulsion containing mRNA condensate-induced non-ionic polymers and salts. The second method is to stabilize mRNA-LNPs using acidic buffers with crowding agents.  The success of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines showed the advantages of this pharmaceutical modality including rapid development, high efficacy, high safety, and ease of manufacturing (as compared to cell culture production). However, deployment of the COVID-19 mRNA vaccines has been met with major logistic challenges due to the intrinsic instability of mRNA. mRNAs undergo fast degradation in aqueous solutions and require freezing or lyophilization (freeze-drying) for transportation and storage. The requirements for ultra-cold chain or lyophilization facilities not only limit the speed of deployment and accessibility of mRNA pharmaceuticals, but also increase the costs and wastage during the distribution process. Using the proposed technologies, mRNA or mRNA-LNP solutions may be able to be stored at room temperature or under refrigeration for months without freezing or lyophilization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preliminary studies indicate that groundwater may supply both dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and iron in this region. In coastal ecosystems like the West Florida Shelf that have very low nitrate and ammonium concentrations, DON is the main form of nitrogen available to organisms. Nitrogen cycling is strongly affected by iron availability because iron is essential for both photosynthesis and for nitrogen fixation. This study will investigate the sources and composition of DON and iron, and their influence on the coastal ecosystem. The team will sample offshore groundwater wells, river and estuarine waters, and conduct two expeditions across the West Florida Shelf in winter and summer. Investigators will participate in K-12 and outreach activities to increase awareness of the project and related science. The project will fund the work of six graduate and eight undergraduate students across five institutions, furthering NSF?s goals of education and training. <br/><br/>Motivated by preliminary observations of unexplained, tightly-correlated DON and dissolved iron concentrations across the West Florida Shelf (WFS), the proposed work will quantify the flux and isotopic signatures of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD)-derived DON and iron to the WFS, and evaluate the bioavailability of this temporally-variable source using four seasonal near-shore campaigns sampling offshore groundwater wells, estuarine, and riverine endmembers and two cross-shelf cruises. The work will evaluate whether SGD stimulates nitrogen fixation on the WFS, and the potential for the stimulated nitrogen fixation to further modify the chemistry of DON and dissolved iron in the region. The cross-shelf cruises will investigate hypothesized periods of maximum SGD and Trichodesmium abundance (June), and reduced river discharge and SGD (February), thus comparing two distinct biogeochemical regimes. The concentrations and isotopic compositions of DON and dissolved iron, molecular composition of DON, and the concentration and composition of iron-binding ligands will be characterized. Nitrogen fixation rates and Trichodesmium spp. abundance and expression of iron stress genes will be measured. Fluxes of DON and iron from SGD and rivers will be quantified with radium isotope mass balances. The impacts of SGD on nitrogen fixation and DON/ligand production will be constrained with incubations of natural phytoplankton communities with submarine groundwater amendments. Two hypotheses will be tested: 1) SGD is the dominant source of bioavailable DON and dissolved iron on the WFS, and 2) SGD-alleviation of iron stress changes the dominant Trichodesmium species on the WFS, increases nitrogen fixation rates and modifies DON and iron composition. Overall, the work will establish connections between marine nitrogen and iron cycling and evaluate the potential for coastal inputs to modify water along the WFS before export to the Atlantic Ocean. This study will thus provide a framework to consider these boundary fluxes in oligotrophic coastal systems and the relative importance of rivers and SGD as sources of nitrogen and iron in other analogous locations, such as coastal systems in Australia, India, and Africa, where nitrogen fixation and SGD have also been documented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, most of the cryopreservation work is performed in the lab, which may not be a feasible solution for many valuable species that exist only in the wild and cannot be easily transported. Consequently, this challenge has impeded the progress of establishing a universal, all-comprehensive biorepository that includes all species on the planet Earth. Further, cryo-storage of biomaterials, including germplasm, tissue, blood and DNA from wildlife species, offers broad opportunities from helping to understand the fundamental biology of unstudied species to enhanced conservation breeding, genomics and veterinary medicine.  As the cryopreservation market continues to grow in the life sciences and biotechnology industries in the future, advances are needed for cryogenically preserving and storing biologically important specimens.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a cryogenic sample storage platform that provides a convenient and portable method to cryogenically preserve biomaterials from rare and endangered species in the wild. The proposed technology smartly senses the remaining level of cryogen in a dewar and refills it automatically, thereby providing a reliable, low-effort supply of liquid nitrogen for on-site storage and eliminating the significant financial burden of constantly shipping large, heavy dewars. The proposed platform consists of three distinct, modifiable modules: a portable liquid nitrogen generator, a transferring mechanism, and a ?smart? storage dewar. A key feature of the portable liquid nitrogen generation design is the use of thermoelectric Peltier modules for cooling. This design provides a lightweight and portable solution for liquid nitrogen generation compared to bulky fractional distillation equipment. It is expected that this design may be optimized for field work where collected samples need to be cryopreserved immediately before being transferred to a long-term cryogenic storage facility. The technology also may have application at sites with a need for low volume cryopreservation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Influence in networks has been the subject of increasing attention among researchers due to its far-reaching social and commercial implications. For instance, the objective of information propagation or viral marketing is to identify the most prominent trend setters capable of influencing vast numbers of others, while the primary objective of epidemiology is to ascertain who is most likely to spread a disease, which aids in the development of vaccine and quarantine regulations. This project will develop novel tools to analyze how the spreading network's structure and initial state maximize the influence flow, and then investigate policy options for controlling the flows. The primary innovation of this project will be its ability to learn the complex relationship between flows and the geometric structure of graphs and extract understandable rules for decision-makers. The main challenge is the huge number of combinations of variables combined across structures and attributes to alter influence flows. <br/><br/>This project advocates a unique paradigm for learning interpretable representations of influence flow over graphs, with a particular emphasis on disentangling the combinatorial limitations imposed by both the graph's geometric structure and seed selection. This research aims at developing a new framework that boosts accuracy and interpretability while decoupling the influence process. The difficulty of developing interpretable models is compounded by the specific characteristics of influence modeling, which include complex tangled topological links, insufficient data, and confluence effects. The investigator will use context-aware constraints and complementing observations to narrow the search and determine the effect source. The investigator will perform an in-depth assessment of effective and efficient control policies to improve influence propagation or blocking. This project will address the following three fundamental research issues: learning expository topological dependence of influence; Learning the influence cascade and the sources; and learning to control the influence flows. The proposed model will determine the optimal seeds that minimize future influence based on the currently influenced region, which requires modeling the interaction of numerous graph-dependent elements. According to thermodynamics' second law, the flow rate is determined by the energy levels within the system, which motivates us to examine graph entropy notions further to provide a more robust assessment of them. The investigator will employ global sensitivity analysis and perturbation matrix theory to choose the smallest yet most critical and robust set.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These scenarios necessitate new designs of STEM graduate education programs that promote interdisciplinary team building, integration of data science in solution methodologies, and exposure of graduate students to multicultural work environments. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to The University of Akron (UA) will support the first such traineeship program in Northeast Ohio for masters and doctoral students working at the interface of materials science and machine learning that will lead to the discovery of new materials and major advances in materials research. The traineeship will serve 40 M.S. and Ph.D. students including 20 funded M.S. and Ph.D. students recruited from diverse backgrounds including underrepresented minority groups and enrolled in graduate programs in polymer science and polymer engineering, mechanical engineering, and computer science.<br/><br/>This NRT program seeks to identify and mitigate the knowledge gaps while providing data-driven answers for several cross-disciplinary research questions that are of interest to the broad materials research community. Examples include i) the tunability of a material modulus with temperature and the quality consistency of composite parts produced via additive manufacturing, ii) the dynamics of ions and mechanisms of ion transport in crystalline polymer domains as in batteries, iii) the molecular design of chemically recyclable polymers with tunable thermal and mechanical properties; iv) novel feature selection techniques in current machine learning tools to handle data from large complex polymeric systems; and v) efficient and systematic integration of large-scale heterogeneous data from multiple sources. The research will utilize a combination of experimental and numerical approaches, including molecular dynamics simulation, finite element analysis, polymer chemistry synthesis, additive manufacturing techniques and machine learning tools, to achieve the desired objectives. This project will create a scalable materials database that is integrable with existing polymer repositories and can be used to develop novel composite materials, molecular design rules for solid electrolytes with superior conductivity, and the design of new polymer materials that can be efficiently recycled.  The trainees will develop strong interdisciplinary skills via courses and research work, workshops and seminars, laboratory rotations, internships at federal and industrial laboratories, and international exposure. They will receive a Data Science Engineering graduate certificate and are expected to become strong proponents of digitalization tools in materials research. The trainees will also participate in outreach and mentoring activities at high schools and two-year colleges to enhance diversity in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This collaborative effort will create a national network of academic and sports industry partners to develop modules paired with data, code, example problems.  All materials will be housed on the Integrated Statistics Learning Environment (ISLE) platform, which will be freely accessible to students and faculty. Industry partners from over 50 sports teams and leagues will work with educators to create authentic modules that will focus on introducing foundational data science topics via sports applications. Resources will be primarily geared towards undergraduate students and will cover a wide array of men?s and women?s sports including baseball, basketball, hockey, tennis, cricket and much more. The project will also offer professional development opportunities for faculty and work to engage a diverse collection of institutions and students with an additional goal of broadening participation in the data science workforce.<br/><br/>This collaboration brings together educators from five institutions (Carnegie Mellon University, Baylor University, St. Lawrence University, University of Pittsburgh and the United States Military Academy) together with sports industry professionals to create authentic curricular materials.  Industry partners will lead the development of each module with guidance from a team of expert educators. As a result, educators will better understand skills and approaches used by sports analytics professionals, and will also have access to case studies build from real-world data. Each module will be reviewed and refined to ensure clarity and accessibility for undergraduates at varying educational stages and within multiple disciplines. Modules will showcase multiple steps for working with data: deciding how to collect and wrangle data, building and assessing appropriate models, and communicating the results. Project materials will be hosted on an Integrated Statistics Learning Environment (ISLE) platform, which will provide user data to help the network better understand how the modules are used, identify areas for improvement, and explore engagement across subgroups of students and educators.

However, annotating the data with labels, which often includes manually adding informative tags on variables of importance in order to train a machine learning model has remained an expensive process in terms of time, labor and human expertise.  Active learning algorithms alleviate this challenge by automatically identifying the salient and exemplar samples from large amounts of unlabeled data, which need to be labeled manually. In a traditional active learning setup, the labeling entities, called oracles, are assumed to be infallible; that is, they always provide the correct answers (in terms of class labels) to the queried samples. However, in real-world applications, the oracles are often imperfect; they may provide incorrect annotations and may even be reluctant to provide any annotations. The overarching goal of this project is to develop novel active leaning algorithms under such challenging, real-world constraints, in an effort to bridge the gap between ideal world and real-world active learning. This project has the potential to tremendously reduce human annotation effort in the design of real-world AI systems (such as medical diagnosis, security and surveillance), thereby creating a significant societal impact. As part of this project, the investigator plans to educate a wide spectrum of students which will help to ensure a strong pipeline of computer scientists to satisfy the technical needs of the nation; he will also seek to increase the number of females and students from underrepresented minorities in graduate STEM related programs.<br/><br/>The goals of this project will be realized through two research objectives. First,  a novel active learning framework will be developed, which can jointly identify the informative unlabeled samples together with the optimal labeling oracles for each sample. This should maximize the probability of obtaining the correct label. Second, novel query and annotation mechanisms will be explored which are less error-prone and easier to answer, thereby increasing the chances of obtaining reliable annotations. The second objective will be demonstrated through two innovative query frameworks: (i) a deep active learning algorithm for vision-based facial age estimation, where the annotators merely need to provide the best estimated upper and lower bounds on the age of a person within a given span, rather than the exact age which may be difficult to estimate; and, (ii) a deep active learning framework for multiclass classification, where the human annotators are allowed to provide alternative labels in response to a given query apart from the topmost choice. This is useful in applications where the annotators are not cognizant about all the classes and may have more than one class choices in mind for a given sample. Extensive user studies will also be conducted to understand the benefits and drawbacks of the proposed solutions. This research will open the door to the development of novel active learning frameworks which are designed to operate in the presence of challenging, real-world constraints.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whereas continuous-time and discrete-time processes depending on several factors are described by systems of partial differential and difference equations, respectively, processes that include both continuous and discrete components (such as processes with time delay caused by the time required to transport mass, energy or information)  are governed by systems of partial difference-differential equations (PDDEs).  Furthermore, very often characteristics of physical, chemical or biological processes have certain symmetries, which can be captured mathematically as transformation group actions.  Thus, the development of computational methods and algorithms for systems of PDDEs and such systems with group action is of primary importance in applications.  Despite the over sixty-year history of constructive methods in differential and difference algebra, there are currently no efficient computational techniques for algebraic PDDEs.  This project aims to develop the theory, methods and algorithms to determine the structure of solutions of systems of such equations including algebraic PDDEs with symmetry group actions. The research results will be applied to systems that describe mathematical models in physics, chemistry and biology. The educational goal of the project is to create an interdepartmental program on applications of symbolic computation that will involve undergraduate and graduate majors in computer science, mathematics, physics and biology at the Catholic University of America (CUA).<br/> <br/>The key research directions of this project are as follows. (1) Development of computational methods and algorithms for difference-differential elimination and for decomposition of solution sets of systems of algebraic PDDEs into unions of simple components. Extension of the obtained techniques to systems with group actions and/or weighted operators. (2) Development of algorithms for building Groebner-type bases in difference-differential modules and algebras. Applications of these algorithms to the computation of dimension functions of algebraic PDDEs that arise in applications. (3) Consistency analysis of finite difference approximations of algebraic differential equations via the techniques of generalized Groebner bases and difference-differential characteristic sets. (4) Application of the obtained methods and algorithms to systems of PDDEs that play fundamental roles in physics, engineering, chemical and biological modeling.  The main methods and approaches of the project include the techniques of generalized difference-differential characteristic sets and relative Groebner bases, the use of dimension polynomials and quasi-polynomials, and decomposition methods for systems of algebraic PDDEs and such systems with group action and weighted basic operators. The results will be demonstrated in interdisciplinary research projects at CUA.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This will be achieved by the design of new organometallic catalysts that provide a high degree of control over the three-dimensional structure of the product molecules. Organometallic catalysts are carbon- and metal-containing substances that, when added in trace amounts to a reaction mixture, speed up the conversion of starting materials to products. Catalysts permit lower reaction temperatures, thereby minimizing energy input and the associated production of green-house gases. In addition, catalysts prevent the formation of undesired byproducts and their associated negative environmental impacts. Novel approaches for the controlled generation of proposed intermediates will advance our understanding of a relatively unexplored but important area of hydrocarbon chemistry. The proposed research will contribute to future advances in the eco-friendly preparation of organic molecules with useful properties.

It is anticipated that these studies will lay a foundation for the development of new catalysts that facilitate challenging reactions that involve highly delocalized, nonpolar transition-state structures. The catalyst design innovations include metal catalysts with a facial array of three accessible metal coordination sites for the simultaneous interaction of the metal with three pi-bonds. Low temperature spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, and computational studies will be utilized to reveal how hexadentate coordination perturbs polyene structures and induces disrotatory triene ring closure. By employing a chiral ancillary ligand, enantioselective electrocyclization will be targeted.

To fulfill these requirements, sixth-generation (6G) era systems will leverage ultra-high carrier frequencies enabled by deploying massive arrays of very small antennas. Such architectures are termed ultra-high dimensional (UHD) communication systems. This is a very challenging scenario for wireless communication, since the UHD channel is difficult to learn and the wireless energy must be radiated in a highly directional manner towards the intended receiver. Existing approaches to channel estimation and beam alignment will not scale to the UHD scenario in terms of complexity, power consumption, or overhead signaling.  This project aims to develop novel, scalable, and high-performing approaches to channel estimation and beam alignment for UHD communication systems using deep generative models (DGMs), an emerging toolset from unsupervised deep learning.   This project will advance the fundamentals of DGMs in a manner appropriate for decentralized real-time applications, and also develop these novel methods for the unique challenges of UHD communication systems.<br/><br/>The project will develop novel theoretical tools for solving challenging inverse problems arising in UHD communication systems, in particular considering (i) resilience to measurement errors and outliers; (ii) resilience to shifting channel distributions and low-resolution measurements; (iii) adaptation to changes in data distribution via federated generative adversarial network (GAN) training; (iv) compressed GAN representations; and (v) incorporating prior information in untrained DGMs via learned regularization.  The project will also research DGM-based (i) interference-robust channel estimation and GAN-training techniques; (ii) federated downlink UHD channel estimation paradigms; (iii) end-to-end UHD channel estimators that account for physical impairments such as low-resolution quantization and RF nonlinearity; (iv) low-latency beam alignment using compressed DGM-based channel representations; and (v) joint channel estimation and beam alignment using DGM-based site-specific codebooks.  The project will also build novel simulators and experiments to accurately characterize UHD channels in the context of 6G cellular systems, in collaboration with the RINGS industry partners, to benefit the wider 6G ecosystem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Autonomous coordination of wireless transmissions to avoid congestions becomes particularly important when numerous IoT devices with stringent power consumption restrictions communicate with an edge device connected to the cloud; collecting information with relatively low data rates such as biomedical signals, detected gases/chemicals levels, temperature, humidity, or vibration data. Such low-power IoT device applications include medical and health care, smart homes, transportation, manufacturing, agriculture, and environmental monitoring. It is imperative to design IoT networks with resilience features deeply embedded across layers from the integrated circuit level to the wireless system level. When IoT devices are employed with sensors in increasingly crowded environments to transmit sensed information, it is essential to increase their awareness of incumbent spectrum users and avoid interference. An overarching goal of this project is to create spectrum-agile IoT networks with low-power adaptive radio frequency (RF) circuits at the sensor nodes, and with coordinated optimization and enhanced security at the edge device. The synergies between the circuits, computing, and wireless networking components of this research are anticipated to create a paradigm for resilient next-generation IoT networks with energy-efficient secure communication between sensor nodes and edge devices. Research and education will be integrated by incorporating the obtained knowledge into graduate and undergraduate education. In addition, high school interns will be engaged through the Center for STEM Education at Northeastern University.<br/><br/>The project entails the research and development of a coordinated cross-layer design methodology for agile communication between edge devices and IoT sensor nodes. This is achieved by distributing spectrum sensing and real-time reconfiguration as follows: fast coarse spectrum sensing and reconfiguration in the sub-6 GHz frequency range on the analog/RF circuit level within low-power IoT devices, fine carrier sensing and network level optimizations on the edge device, and enhancement of high-level authentication and anomaly detection with the computing capabilities on the edge device; all aided by wirelessly transmitted information from temperature sensors used as activity detectors embedded in the IoT device transceiver. This cross-layer approach aims at enabling adaptive edge networks by providing the device-level ability to quickly respond to disruptive interference events by changing the transmit and receive frequencies at the IoT nodes, while performing intelligent real-time machine learning (ML) functions for coordinated communication within the network on the edge device with a software-defined radio (SDR) and field-programmable gate array (FPGA). Security will be enhanced at the wireless system level through ML-based RF fingerprinting, while robustness will be enhanced through federated learning techniques. At the hardware level, security will be enhanced through monitoring of power dissipation via embedded temperature sensors. The cross-cutting approach is not only expected to increase the component-level trust that can be established when new IoT devices are introduced into the network, but also to improve run-time reliability by capturing abnormal operations due to malicious intrusions or hardware faults based on the wirelessly transmitted on-chip temperature profiles from the IoT devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technology will accelerate electrification of the US economy, lessen the nation?s dependence on fossil fuels, reduce peak electricity demand, and lower emissions of greenhouse gases such as CO2. GSHPs operate quietly and reliably, provide humidity control, and can provide both heating and cooling, greatly increasing the comfort of building environments and quality of life. GSHPs can also reduce and levelize utility bills in low-income housing and enhance the ability to provide energy assistance programs to those in need.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to further develop a novel technology that will overcome barriers in the applicability, desirability and cost-competitiveness of GSHP systems. The project?s chief technical objectives are to improve tools and knowhow relating to the application of the proposed novel in-ground heat exchanger technology and to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of this technology in real-world applications in targeted geographical markets. Specifically, the project will further refine the computational modeling tools used to size heat exchanger systems; and develop and integrate sophisticated geospatial data sets that these models will use/ This will result in more accurate and more rapid heat exchanger sizing on a site-specific basis. Next, the project will validate these tools through extended testing and data collection on a prototype system installed on a home system. Finally, this project will apply these tools during the deployment of three commercial systems in targeted geographic markets and collect additional data regarding their performance over time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this project is to use randomized testing (fuzzing) to make it easier to write, debug, and reason about specifications. The project's novelties are: studying the theory and practice of fuzzing with high-level specifications that traditionally operate on highly structured and highly constrained data; developing a theory of feedback-based generation of such data; and streamlining the evaluation of how these (and future) techniques perform in practice. The project's impacts are increased developer productivity and software quality, rendering the benefits of specifications accessible to more programmers through a combined research and educational effort.<br/><br/>The project targets the problem of generating random structured test data with semantic constraints, with a particular focus on two synergistic thrusts: (1) how to make the most out of every test run by gathering additional information and revealing which tests led to previously unseen or otherwise interesting behavior; and (2) how to mutate such tests while staying within the structural and semantic constraints imposed, maximizing the chance to uncover errors.

Whether it is interacting with an AI agent in an online virtual environment or deciding where to eat next with the help of a virtual assistant, AI systems are increasingly integrated into our everyday lives. With such wide-spread deployment, understanding how a person?s context affects their interaction with AI systems is vital to designing and developing competent and ethical AI systems. AI systems should be able to interact as appropriately with someone who is stressed or has been marginalized by societal structures as well as it does with someone free of stress or has not been subject to socio-cultural structures that systematically marginalize them. This research will advance the understanding of how one can create AI systems that can adapt to differences in people (and the social structures that might mediate these differences), while also advancing the understanding of how a person?s context affects the way they perceive and cooperate with an AI system. The research in this project is complemented with multiple educational thrusts, including a plan to develop a pre-orientation program that targets incoming first year undergraduates from traditionally marginalized groups. The program will help undergraduate students be critically reflective how their own context affects the way they might design, develop, and implement AI systems. <br/><br/>The goal of this work is to develop a process-based multilevel computational theory that describes how human socio-cultural knowledge can positively affect the design, development, and interaction with AI agents. The project aims to understand how one can develop competent AI agents that can account for differing socio-cultural perspectives and their effects. Products of this work include an extended computational cognitive architecture and new cognitive AI agents that will be useful for the development of other AI systems. These products will also be useful for general computational models that simulate human behavior. The project will result in a computational model of interactions between physiological, affective, and cognitive systems that modulate human behavior, as well as an account for socio-cultural knowledge that affords certain uses of these systems and processes during human-AI interaction. The computational model will connect areas related to human behavior and AI on several time scales to make the modeling, simulation, and study of human-AI interaction more tractable. In concert with the computational models and tools, the investigator will conduct studies that provide a deeper understanding of how socio-cultural perspectives and knowledge affects and is used by people while cooperating with AI agents during tasks. Results from these studies will inform the computational model. The work will result in a deeper qualitative and quantitative and under-standing of the processes and knowledge that mediate human-AI interaction, the development of more competent AI agents, and open-source computational tools to continue to expand upon this understanding.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One example of this is the relationship between early vocabulary size, literacy, and later academic achievement. With this relationship in mind, many vocabulary enrichment programs based on shared reading with a caregiver have been developed, with mixed success. Evidence suggests that individualizing target-vocabulary selection can improve learning, but manually generating stories that include personalized target words for every child is infeasible. Automatic story generation using natural language processing techniques has the potential to solve this problem. Although there has been some progress in automatic story generation for adults, this is an unsolved and particularly challenging problem when stories are targeted for preschoolers, because both content and complexity need to be tailored to the age group. Thus, the researchers explore multiple innovative machine learning methods to generate engaging, high-quality child-directed stories that contain specific words that will enrich a child?s vocabulary. Furthermore, preschoolers and their caregivers participate in story-sharing activities to investigate if the automatically generated stories are effective tools for teaching words to children. This research is particularly critical for low-income families and dual language learners, who are more likely to exhibit vocabulary delays while, at the same time, being less likely to receive intervention support.<br/><br/>This EArly Grant for Exploratory Research makes novel and potentially transformative contributions to the area of automatic story generation by taking necessary exploratory steps towards flexible, adaptive technology that can automatically generate personalized, engaging, and effective stories for toddlers and their caregivers to share at home as a vehicle for early vocabulary enrichment. Specifically, the first part of this project consists of the following: 1) an investigation of multiple computational models with regards to their suitability for preschooler-directed story generation; 2) a study of strategies to avoid the generation of content that is not suitable for children by machine learning-based story generation models; and 3) an exploration of how to automatically incorporate a set of predefined target words into generated stories. Furthermore, the team of researchers investigates the quality of story generation models and the stories' effectiveness for word learning via the following: 4) obtaining feedback from families in the local community as to whether the automatically generated stories are appropriate and engaging for preschoolers and 5) conducting a laboratory study in which stories will be shared by caregivers and their children in a setting that resembles a natural home environment and subsequently comparing the children?s knowledge of target words against control words.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Within the wireless landscape, several important use cases rely on multihop mmWave network deployments, including private networks, such as in shopping centers, airports, museums and enterprises;  mmWave mesh networks that use mmWave links as backhaul in dense urban scenarios; military applications employing mobile hotspots; and mmWave based vehicle-to-everything (V2X) services, such as cooperative perception.  Despite the aforementioned promising aspects of mmWave communication, it is well known that -- because of the hostile propagation nature of the mmWave spectrum -- mmWave links are highly sensitive to blockage, channels may abruptly change and paths get disrupted. Moreover, as in traditional wireless networks, mmWave network nodes are susceptible to component failures, due to factors such as natural hazards and resource depletion. If successful, this project aims to provide novel transmission mechanisms that are resilient against such disruptions.<br/><br/>Towards achieving the objectives of the research, the project builds on the so-called 1-2-1 network model that offers a simple yet informative model for mmWave networks.  The project work includes the design of proactive mechanisms, that aim to build resilience in advance by exploiting tools that range from multipath diversity to multilevel and network coding; the design of reactive mechanisms, that  identify and adapt to link or node failures, using tools such as backpressure algorithms and reinforcement learning; and synthesis of the above mechanisms to enable a suite of tools that can serve a variety of applications. A key feature that differentiates mmWave networks from networks that are represented as graphs is beam scheduling, which offers both opportunities to build resilience, as well as challenges mainly in terms of complexity of operation.

The project seeks to improve numerical weather prediction capabilities for both research applications and weather forecasting support for the US Antarctic Program.  The project goals include evaluating the use of special observations to improve atmospheric modeling, determining whether the new technique is superior to existing techniques for Antarctic atmospheric simulation and weather prediction, and assess how well the model is performing in its prediction of polar clouds and precipitation.  The project will advance the field by applying an unprecedented dataset gathered in an international collaboration and determining its benefit for future science and forecasting.  It will also advance the field by exploring a new method for the use of such information in atmospheric models for the polar regions.  The benefits are increases in knowledge, improved weather modeling, and gains in the model weather forecasting capabilities that the Antarctic Program relies on, allowing for enhanced efficiency and safety for Antarctic operations.

Specifically, within the Year of Polar Prediction ? Southern Hemisphere (YOPP-SH) framework, this project has four aspects.  First, the team will identify candidate Targeted Observing Periods (TOPs) from East Antarctica to the Ross Sea. Second, the dataset of special YOPP-SH radiosonde launches made in the TOPs will be assimilated into model experiments using the Weather Research and Forecasting (WRF) model, which is run in the Antarctic Mesoscale Prediction System (AMPS), the numerical weather prediction capability for USAP.  These data assimilation experiments will apply the AMPS framework to determine the impact of the observations on predictions of major weather events affecting the US Antarctic Program (USAP) McMurdo and Palmer Stations, and to identify the governing processes.  Third, a new data assimilation capability for the WRF Model? Multi-Resolution Incremental 4DVAR (MRI-4DVAR) ?is being tested in these data impact experiments to determine its effectiveness for real-time use in AMPS and thus for possible future implementation as well as for research modeling.  Fourth, cloud and precipitation observations collected during the TOPs at Davis and Vernadsky Stations will be applied to analyses of the WRF simulations to assess model weaknesses. This project aims to enhance WRF?s handling of clouds and precipitation to improve parameterization.

These reductions are achieved through electrification enhanced by ?load shifting,? the practice of consuming energy from the grid at times when it is cheapest and cleanest, and storing that energy for use in the home all day (including peak usage times). The project goals are to improve the reliability, security, and scalable manufacturability of this system, making it affordable to install for most households. Residential-scale load shifting will help the housing industry move from fossil fuel-based heating to meet emissions reduction requirements in a cost-effective way. The load shifting capability using readily available hot water storage allows utilities to balance the energy grid and increase the deployment of renewable energy sources with reduced infrastructure costs, as well as reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes to address the technical risks facing large scale deployment of heating and hot water load shifting to enable rapid deployment of high-efficiency heat pump systems for residential applications in the United States.

Understanding how plasma interacts with neutral elements in the atmospheres around the Sun and Earth is important for space weather modeling and prediction. For instance, predicting satellite drag requires knowledge of the density of Earth's thermosphere, which is modified by solar radiation and ions from solar wind. Yet, space weather models sometimes ignore the effects of plasma-neutral interactions or rely on dated models developed using simple experiments. This project will undertake a pioneering laboratory investigation of collisions in plasmas, develop new models for plasma-neutral interaction, and fold them into state-of-the-art space weather models. The team will also create science kits with hands-on activities and instructional materials and distribute them to every elementary school in 21 counties in West Virginia. The project is a collaborative effort between West Virginia University, University of Texas at Arlington, Bay Area Environmental Research Institute, Electric Power Research Institute and Spark! Imagination and Science Center in West Virginia.<br/><br/>Understanding ion-neutral interactions is important for modeling magnetosphere/ionosphere/thermosphere coupling and the dynamics of the solar chromosphere, which influence space weather. Ion-neutral collision frequency plays a critical role for both Joule heating and ionospheric and chromospheric (ambipolar) conductivity. The project team will conduct a multi-fluid, multi-species laboratory study of ion-neutral coupling, develop a new model for collision frequency for the terrestrial ionosphere, and incorporate ion-neutral coupling in a chromosphere simulation model. The newly developed collision frequency model will be incorporated into the Global Ionosphere Thermosphere Model and the Space Weather Modeling Framework and validated using space-based observations. Wider scientific community participation in this work will be encouraged through two workshops. The research and educational activities will involve postdoctoral researchers, graduate and undergraduate students.

Neutron and X-ray methods probe the structure and dynamics of materials at the atomic scale and can provide insight into a host of scientific and technological problems. Many of these problems require high resolution and non-destructive techniques that can study the same sample over long periods of time, from hours to weeks, and there are currently no combined X-ray and neutron scattering and imaging facilities capable of performing these measurements. Establishing such a facility could advance our understanding of a broad array of problems, many of which are central to problems facing society, including the chemistry of lithium battery degradation and how plant roots seek water and chemical nutrients.<br/><br/>This workshop will engage approximately 100 thought-leaders from academic, industrial, and governmental sectors with expertise in the chemical sciences and related areas, such as energy, biological chemistry, materials science, and cultural artifacts, as well as experts in X-ray and neutron sciences to discuss a potential facility that could fill this gap. Participants will define the roadmap and relationships between instrumentation and the demanding and evolving requirements of the scientific applications.  The workshop will explore how to efficiently align a university-based X-ray and neutron facility with the world-class instrumentation available at NIST-, NSF- and DOE-supported national facilities, as well as how to advance existing X-ray and neutron sources to meet the current and future needs of the research community. Areas for collaborations will be identified by the participants with a goal of advanced convergent research, education, and instrumentation objectives. The workshop will also explore opportunities such a facility would provide in training students in combined X-ray and neutron instrumentation development, as well as crafting advanced experimental protocols for studying complex systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each sensor may provide complementary or reinforced information that supports tasks such as target detection, classification, or scene understanding. In remote sensing applications, for example, hyperspectral imaging sensors can provide spectral information about materials by using a wide range of wavelengths, while LiDAR (light detection and ranging) measures an object's elevation above the ground. If a road and a building rooftop are built with the same material (e.g., asphalt), hyperspectral information alone may not be sufficient to tell them apart, while integrating height information from LiDAR data makes it easier to distinguish the two. This project will develop innovative mathematical framework and associated algorithms for integrating such sensor data from multiple sources. The main novelty of this project will be in its capacity to learn the relationships and non-linear interactions among multiple sources during data integration, while addressing data and label uncertainties commonly observed in real-world sensor data. This work will advance the fundamental knowledge in explainable data integration and is applicable to a broad range of data-intensive applications with significant social impact including remote sensing, autonomous driving, robotic vision and perception, and precision agriculture. This work will also support cross-disciplinary research and educational activities, including mentoring students from diverse backgrounds, outreach activities through hands-on design projects and the development of undergraduate and graduate-level courses on data integration and machine learning at the University of Michigan.<br/><br/>This project aims to bridge existing gaps in knowledge by developing a unified, weakly supervised learning-based framework for heterogeneous multi-sensor data integration, accounting for both data and label uncertainties. This project addresses the following three research components. The first objective of this research is to develop a scalable and efficient computational model leveraging the binary fuzzy measures under the multiple instance learning framework, which will reduce the search space of the non-linear aggregation operator such as the Choquet integral (CI) and be significantly more robust at handling data integration for larger numbers of sources. The second objective is to leverage bi-capacities and bi-polar CI to account for conflicts and negation of evidence in data sources. Experiments will be conducted to investigate how each data source and their combinations contribute to different integration outcomes. This study will allow for greater explainability and adaptability when integrating complex and heterogeneous datasets. The third objective is to extend the current multiple instance CI framework for sequential inputs, such as multi-view and multi-temporal data, which will uncover the untapped potential of using CI for spatiotemporal data integration. This research will make data integration manageable, interpretable, and applicable with large volumes of multi-modal data to facilitate decision making and knowledge discovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to create new theory and experiments to understand xenobiotic evolution. The results of this project would have applications across many different fields such as bacteria resistant to antibiotics, malaria parasites resistant to antimalarial drugs, tumor cells resistant to cancer drugs, plants resistant to herbicides, and insects resistant to insecticides. The award provides support to train STEM graduate students that will eventually become part of the workforce. The project also provides research opportunities for undergraduates and develops new educational games that teach K-12 students about science, using xenobiotic evolution as an example.<br/><br/>The main goal of this project is to discover novel aspects of xenobiotic adaptation that result from the interactions between mutations and gene amplifications. The project examines the complex, nonlinear evolutionary pathways that lead to xenobiotic adaptation in the context of antibiotic resistance evolution induced by Rifampin in E. coli. Mathematically, the project would model resistance evolution as a function of plasmid copy number with the use of a stochastic process that accounts for tunneling rates and spatial structures of the community of evolving cells. The project makes use of an incoherent feed forward loop that gives synthetic control for providing variation in plasmid copy numbers in cells while keeping biochemical levels constant.

They threaten large population centers along these coasts with possible tsunamis, and move material from the shallow to the deep sea during margin evolution. Despite their high prevalence on passive margins and in particular, on the U.S. east coast, very little about their causes, mechanical behavior, and frequency is understood, and their role in the development of the passive margin as it exists today has not been examined. This project will collect new seismic data with the R/V Marcus Langseth to examine large submarine landslide behavior over the past 23 million years in a region offshore North Carolina that has experienced large, recent submarine landslides. Sediment cores will be retrieved from the Cape Fear Slide, which is the most recent large submarine landslide in the area and still expressed on the seafloor. The cores will provide insights into pre-conditioning and triggering mechanisms. This study will improve understanding of how slope failures operate through time and the manner in which past events might influence subsequent events, and will provide training and international collaboration opportunities for three graduate students and three early-career scientists.<br/><br/>This project will collect high-resolution multichannel seismic data and piston cores on the continental rise and slope in the vicinity of the Cape Fear submarine landslide offshore North Carolina. These data will be used to examine the interplay between margin topography, fluid and heat flow, pore pressure, and submarine mass transport deposits. Mass transport deposits, bottom-simulating reflections, and stratigraphic sequences in the Cape Fear region will be seismically imaged. The new high-resolution seismic data will be combined with existing seismic and borehole data to interpret number of events, timing, source areas, volumes, areal extent and runout length, and bounding surfaces of mass transport deposits. The seismic data will be used to assess and model internal characteristics of mass transport deposits and surrounding sediments, including deformation style, present-day pore pressure and temperature distribution, and the presence of gas. This project consists of acquiring 3843 km of 2D high-resolution multichannel seismic data, along with bathymetry, subbottom profiler, and water column data. Seven piston and seven gravity cores will be collected in locations associated with seeps or bottom-simulating reflections. Geotechnical and pore fluid chemical analyses will be performed. The processed seismic data will be interpreted for stratigraphic age control, areal extent, and volume of mass transport deposits. Internal deformation of mass transport deposits will be examined through seismic attribute analysis. Sediment physical properties will be derived using full waveform inversion and quantitative models of conditions for failure will be developed. The results of this project will be relevant to understanding submarine landslides dynamics on passive margins with similar characteristics worldwide.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding charge transport is vital to pursuing new developments in areas considered critically important to long-term national economic success including electronics, solar energy, and materials development. Nanoscale organic electronic devices display unique charge transport properties that can be used to design improved electronic devices (ex. transistors, resistors), but it is challenging to describe charge transport in many of these devices using existing computational methods. The joint Rowan and Butler team will develop new computational tools for generating the charge transport data needed to design the next generation of electronic devices based on non-classical charge transport effects. The developed computational tools will be incorporated into the OpenMolcas software package, which is widely used in both educational and research efforts. Both Butler University and Rowan University have strong commitments to undergraduate education, and a core educational outcome of this project is the development of computationally-engaged undergraduate students fit for either academic or industry positions. Through student recruitment partnerships with mentorship programs and local community colleges, this project provides a pathway into research for students from non-traditional backgrounds and underrepresented groups in the computational sciences.<br/><br/>Nanoscale organic electronic devices that operate at the single-molecule level are a key experimental platform for enhancing the scientific community?s understanding of charge transport at the quantum level. Created by combining single organic molecules with metal or carbon-based electrodes, single-molecule devices hold the potential to be the foundation for the next generation of transistors, resistors, and switches for nanoscale electronics. Large gaps remain in our theoretical understanding of non-classical charge transport effects in nanoscale electronics such as the reversal of the expected electrical conductance decay with increasing molecular length. A key reason for this is the limited treatment of electron-electron interactions (electron correlation) by existing transport methods particularly strong/multireference correlation. To resolve this, the Hoy/Sand research team will develop a fully-quantum family of multiconfigurational charge transport methods based on multiconfiguration pair density functional theory (MC-PDFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green?s function formalism (NEGF). Key objectives include the development of new MC-PDFT-based effective Hamiltonians and self-consistent optimization schemes for multiconfigurational Green?s function transport theories. The integration of these developments within an open-source modular Python framework allows for the characterization of multireference correlation effects in quantum transport phenomena. Using these NEGF-MCPDFT methodologies, the team will investigate including reversed conductance decay, Coulomb blockades, and Kondo Resonances to enhance the scientific community?s understanding of quantum charge transport phenomena.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There remains, however, a wide gap to bridge between the theory and practice of physical-layer security. This project addresses this challenge by combining hardware and software efforts, including milimeter-wave radio-frequency front-ends with beamforming capability and algorithms with low-latency, to create a physical-layer security monolithically integrated hardware platform. The outcome of this project will be hardware offering ""just-in-time secrecy,"" in the sense of adapting to link conditions and achieve cost-effective tradeoffs between power, latency, and security.<br/><br/>The first thrust of this project investigates a hardware platform that integrates a broadband antenna array to engineer a physical-layer link suitable for physical-layer security together with a low-latency mixed-signal implementation of codes for secrecy.

The debate focuses on changes in skill composition of the labor force, returns to skills such as education attainment and unobserved skills, and in institutions such as unions, minimum wage, and trade agreements. The Covid-19 pandemic shocked the global economy with implications for earnings, education, skills, and jobs, and thus inequality and the design of public policy responses.  This project will use a coherent framework, across the major economies of Europe and North America, to study  a broad set of inequalities and how the COVID-19 pandemic has changed these inequalities , and how policy in each economy has responded. This research project goes beyond the description and causes of inequality trends across countries, to study the potential role of policies at different stages on different groups.  It also looks at how human capital policies and labor market regulations influence market inequalities, and how taxes and transfers can reduce inequalities in disposable income.  The results of this will provide important inputs into labor market policies that could increase incomes and reduce income inequality in developed countries.  The results will also help establish the US as the global leader in equality of labor market outcomes.<br/><br/>The project involves a network of 17 groups of researchers from across Europe and North America to understand the drivers of economic inequalities across high income countries. The teams will mobilize a vast array of data sources to study in detail differences across educational attainment, race, ethnicity, and immigration status, and the mechanisms by which households are able to smooth income shocks. In some countries the survey data include a direct link to administrative records, permitting a more rich and accurate assessment of inequalities across countries and the life course. The team from the United States will use both public-access data from the Current Population Survey (CPS) Annual Social Economic Supplement (ASEC), as well as restricted access survey and administrative that provides a direct link between the CPS ASEC and Social Security Administration?s Detailed Earnings Records (DER). The project then proceeds with four related research strands. The first strand uses harmonized data to study the evolution of several economic inequalities before and during the COVID-19 pandemic. The second strand examines labor market inequalities in detail. The third strand highlights the role of education and training for non-university attendees and focusses on the impact of large cross-country differences in educational systems on inequality.

Our goal is to build upon previous ADVANCE initiatives by transparently quantifying self-identified intersecting gender and racial/ethnic identities (IGRE identities) to track STEM women faculty?s retention and promotion at Kent State University (KSU). Women complete more high-workload/low-status service tasks, which can be an obstacle to their upward mobility in academia. Therefore, transparently quantifying disparities in service workload is imperative. Relative to men, women are disproportionately more likely to hold service positions with little visibility or prestige. We have empirical evidence that women engage in more service work than men at KSU: A 2017 KSU climate survey found more women (47%) than men (34%) faculty reported feeling burdened by service responsibilities, and women disproportionately comprise undergraduate research mentors. Our proposed online dashboard will aggregate service burden by NSF-recognized STEM fields, rank, and IGREs. We will measure subjective perceptions of the prestige, workload, and fulfillment associated with faculty members? service activities to identify those STEM fields with the greatest service workload inequities. We will analyze exit interview data collected across the last decade from faculty who separated from the university to determine whether/how their IGRE identities and service burdens contributed to their departure decision. Finally, we will establish a STEM Women?s Support Network to promote community building and mentorship pertaining to service workloads. A key strength of our project is its focus on making institutional change to remedy structural inequities. <br/><br/>Our project addresses service burden, a specific upstream cause of gender inequity, to improve retention and advancement of STEM women faculty at KSU. The specific aim of our project is to transparently quantify inequities in service commitments by intersecting gender and racial/ethnic identities (IGRE identities) while maintaining faculty anonymity. Our approach builds on previous NSF ADVANCE work (NSF Grant #1463898) reporting such transparency is an efficacious intervention for reducing gender disparities in service. The timing is perfect for our project, which will involve quantitative (i.e., online anonymous surveys about service commitments and perceptions) as well as qualitative research methodology (e.g., secondary data analyses of exit interview responses and merit review materials), because it dovetails with KSU's recently released strategic DEI plan. KSU, an eight-campus, doctoral-granting public institution with ~42,000 students, which was recently granted the highest research Carnegie Classification (i.e., R1), is an ideal ADVANCE award recipient. Our diverse research team has strong institutional support. Our central repository of KSU STEM faculty service data will transparently track service commitments by self-identified IGRE identities to improve upward mobility of women STEM faculty through tenure/administration ranks, chipping away at macro-level gender inequalities in the STEM professoriate. Moreover, our approach can be readily adapted to address IGRE inequalities in university and institutional contexts across the world. Other broader impacts include continued transparency in record-keeping beyond the ?life? of the grant, amplification of women?s voices, and interdisciplinary research training and dissemination opportunities for trainees at various career stages. <br/><br/>The NSF ADVANCE program is designed to foster gender equity through a focus on the identification and elimination of organizational barriers that impede the full participation and advancement of diverse faculty in academic institutions. Organizational barriers that inhibit equity may exist in policies, processes, practices, and the organizational culture and climate. ADVANCE ""Catalyst"" awards provide support for institutional equity assessments and the development of five-year faculty equity strategic plans at academic, non-profit institutions of higher education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology will be integrated into an intelligent home system that automatically controls the optimal battery storage unit operation and electricity purchase decisions, and will be implemented in the embedded controller unit to enable real-time decisions. The aim of the project is to establish the feasibility and verify the real-world performance of the proposed DRO model, particularly in the field of energy systems.<br/> <br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of new models and algorithms for residential photovoltaic (PV)-battery system operations using the distributionally robust optimization (DRO) paradigm. The proposed scheme automatically controls the operation of the battery storage unit to optimally determine when to store the excess amount of PV generation or to discharge the stored amount to satisfy the household energy demand. Prior systems unrealistically assumed a known probabilistic description for the uncertain electricity prices, PV generation, and energy consumption. In most real-life situations, this description is never available. The decision-makers only have access to historical data that may be used to infer the underlying probabilistic description. The DRO scheme addresses this fundamental shortcoming by first constructing a set of plausible distributions consistent with the available information and then optimizes for battery storage operations that perform best for all distributions in the set, safely anticipating potentially adverse outcomes. The proposed scheme may mitigate overfitting to the data and yield high-quality battery operations in out-of-sample circumstances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This relies on our ability to reconstruct accurate images of brain activity from millions of neurons. However, traditional electrophysiological techniques using the current paradigm of the ?single-neuron per electrode? approach lack the scalability to read signals from millions of neurons. Therefore, it is critical to investigate new means of interacting with neurons. To address this unmet need, the objective of this CAREER project is to discover a new neural interfacing modality using brain neurochemicals that can accurately capture the brain?s activity at a large scale. The project will also lead an exciting role in closing the knowledge and interest gaps in science and engineering via a multidimensional approach, including a new high-school research program, undergraduate research experience, and teach-in events at local public schools. <br/><br/>The main idea of this project is to exploit the stochastic nature of neurotransmitter diffusion to investigate a superresolution neurochemical imaging technique. The excitation of neurons results in action potentials that propagate through the neuronal body and axons toward synapses. At the synapses, these action potentials instigate the secretion of neurotransmitters. Neurotransmitter molecules released from a single vesicle diffuse and subsequently reach multiple adjacent electrodes to be measured. Based on the diffusion characteristics, the precise origin of neurotransmitter secretion can be localized. This localization technique is similar to triangulation in principle, but it considers the diffusion path to make precise localization of neural activities. This method has unique advantages over triangulation by being able to distinguish both x-y location and also z position based on the diffusion characteristic. Also, because the diffusion of molecules is a slower process compared to voltage propagation, the point source can be pinpointed with high accuracy. Using this approach, a few electrodes can produce neurochemical imaging with a high spatial resolution. This new approach will transform neural interfaces by enabling simultaneous measurements from millions of neurons without requiring an equivalent density of electrodes. The superresolution neurochemical probe will help unravel the complex role of dopamine?s spatial distribution in cognitive processes by directly mapping the neurochemical activities in the brain with high spatiotemporal resolution. This project will result in not only the most advanced neurochemical probe available to date but also the superresolution algorithm that can enhance the spatial resolution into nanometers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is particularly important as production of electric vehicles and offshore wind turbines which use these magnets are projected to grow by 20-50% per year over the next decade. The production rare earth element currently has a very high carbon footprint due to the use of perfluorocarbon that are then emitted into the atmosphere contributing to global warming. The rare earth metal industry produces 30,000-50,000 tons/year of Neodynium, Dysprosium, Praseodymium and Terbium.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a technology to extract rare earth metals from magnet scrap because rare earth metals are in short supply as there are currently no U.S. producers of most rare earth metals. The proposed process of recycling rare earth elements uses a liquid metal solvent leachate to dissolve the rare earth elements in magnets, followed by a novel gravity-driven multi effects thermal system distiller (G-METS) to separate the rare earth elements from the liquid metal solvent. This distillation technology seeks to reduce the overall flow sheet energy consumption by 70% and the overall capital and operating costs by 50%, compared with traditional vacuum distillation. This process, with magnesium leaching and G-METS distillation, uses much less energy than current electrolytic rare earth production, with no perfluorocarbon emissions.

Reports of this international geopolitical crisis have instantaneously flooded traditional and social media outlets with graphic videos and images of injuries, death, and destruction ? media coverage known to correlate with poor physical and mental health outcomes. But the Ukraine War is occurring in the broader context of the COVID-19 pandemic whose worldwide death toll exceeds 6 million people, escalating climate-related crises, economic volatility and inflation, race-driven social unrest, extreme partisanship, and low confidence in the scientific and social institutions tasked with protecting the public. Direct and media-based exposure to these unprecedented cascading collective traumas are likely to have profound effects on the mental and physical health of Americans. Effective management of these compounding crises requires policies that people support and public adoption of recommended behaviors. <br/><br/>This project assesses psychological reactions to the Ukraine War among a large probability-based nationally representative sample of over 6,500 Americans from the NORC AmeriSpeak panel. They have been surveyed three times since March 2020. Early responses and beliefs about the war in Ukraine are collected as the media transitions from heavy coverage of COVID-19 to heavy coverage of the conflict. Analyses examine how intolerance for uncertainty, emotion regulation, trust in government, and social identities may explain the association between media exposure and emotional, cognitive, and behavioral responses to the war. This study investigates how fears and worries about these multiple ongoing threats are compounding negative mental health outcomes and impacting those for whom this multiplicative effect is most detrimental. Finally, this project investigates how war-related media exposure may motivate people to take positive action (e.g., prosocial behavior) to help refugees and defend Ukraine?s democracy. Embedding this project in the larger study of the COVID-19 pandemic allows examination of national responses to compounding global crises as they evolve, producing theoretically rich research with practical importance. Results inform policy makers when communicating publicly about multiple existential threats and their potential solutions so they can better promote public well-being without inducing further worry, distress, or emotional exhaustion.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Learning will have to be performed on data predominantly originating at edge and user devices in order to support applications such as Internet of Things (IoT), federated learning, mobile healthcare, self-driving cars, and others. A growing body of research work has focused on engaging the edge in the learning process, which can be advantageous in terms of a better utilization of network resources, delay reduction, resiliency against cloud unavailability and catastrophic failures, and increased security and privacy. Present proposed solutions, however, predominantly suffer from having a critical centralized component, typically in the cloud, that organizes and aggregates the nodes? computations. This rigid centralized infrastructure can inhibit the full potential of resiliency and privacy in NextG systems. By relaxing the centralized infrastructure, the proposed research aims to advance Random Walk learning algorithms as the basis of a unified framework for the joint design of distributed learning and networking, with resiliency and  privacy being the overarching goal.<br/><br/>In Random Walk learning, the model can be thought of as a ?baton? that is updated and passed from one node (cloud, edge node, end-devices, etc.) in the network to one of its neighbors that is smartly chosen.

The proposed work will focus on major challenges and opportunities specific to the applicability of random walk learning in NextG, namely: (i) Adaptability to the heterogeneity of the data and the heterogeneity and dynamic nature of the network; (ii) Resiliency and graceful degradation in the face of failures via coding-theoretic redundancy methods; (iii) Model distribution across nodes and random walking snakes; and (iv) Privacy of the locally owned data.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project at Hudson Valley Community College (HVCC) seeks to address the critical need for electricians and technicians with applicable knowledge of the V2G interface.  The project will meet this need by (1) developing educational modules to train electricians in the theory and operation of BEV charging systems, and (2) training automotive/light truck technicians in the theory and operation of electrical generation and supply grids.  HVCC will develop BEV charging system educational modules that can be easily and efficiently integrated into existing degree programs, and make these training modules widely available for implementation by other educational institutions throughout the country.

The PI will also promote mathematics to the broader community and encourage the participation of underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>One of the major open problems in pointwise ergodic theory is the Furstenberg-Bergelson-Leibman conjecture, which asserts that the multiple polynomial ergodic averages converge pointwise almost everywhere. The PI will develop tools in Fourier analysis and additive combinatorics allowing to study pointwise convergence for multiple polynomial ergodic averages corresponding to polynomials with distinct degrees. In addition, the PI will investigate polynomial Szemeredi's type theorems in topological fields and multidimensional integer grids.  At the heart of these investigations are the so-called inverse theorems from higher order Fourier analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although phreatomagmatic eruptions tend to be unpredictable, the very high eruption column of Hunga Tonga created a pressure pulse in the atmosphere that was measured around the globe, leading scientists to estimate that the energy released was equivalent to several 10 megatons of TNT. Initial findings show that some properties of the magma may have played a critical role in making this volcano so explosive. The investigators will attempt to conduct laboratory experiments in larger scales than before to test the hypothesis that the presence of vesicle networks, bubbles, enhanced the rate of heat transfer from magma to water during induced fuel coolant interaction, caused the highly explosive system expansion observed. In terms of broader impacts, successful results would help our understanding of how interactions between magma and water can lead to explosive events and constrain the effects of scaling on our models for this phenomenon. Support will also help enhance infrastructure for research and education, while providing training for a student.<br/><br/>The investigators propose to study the possible influence of bubble networks on the explosivity of magma-water interaction, by conducting induced fuel coolant interaction experiments on a meter-scale, which involves about 30 Liters of melt. This will be the first realization of this mechanism type on a larger than lab scale, which allows for more material complexities and helps to scale laboratory findings to field scale. It is suggested that that in the Hunga Tonga volcanic eruption of January 2022, the presence of vesicle networks, bubbles, enhanced the rate of heat transfer from magma to water during induced fuel coolant interaction that caused the highly explosive system expansion. The investigators will adapt their current experimental setup that have proven to work in previous magma-water interaction tests to provide means to scale lab- and meter-scale observations to natural scale scenarios. If successful, they hope to answer whether bubbles can serve as a booster to interaction intensity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will host REU students at East Carolina University?s Coastal Studies Institute with additional remote mentors from Clemson University and the University of Puerto Rico at Arecibo. Research teams will investigate and document how human actions positively or negatively influence coastal resilience in the face of extreme weather events, sea level rise, and population growth. Undergraduate researchers will work with faculty at these three institutions to address issues in coastal resilience, which is a problem of societal urgency as these regions face critical challenges to infrastructure, food and energy security, human health, and ecosystem sustainability. The project includes important training elements in Team Science that will prepare students to effectively address problems in interdisciplinary work and graduate research settings, build their ability to communicate science to the public, and take a systems perspective on solving societal challenges. Targeted professional development activities, a diversity of participants, and use of virtual collaboration tools to support Team Science with a range of researchers from multiple fields and institutions will therefore also engage students in working across disciplinary, geographic, and cultural boundaries. These skills will prepare the students to participate in research when direct contact between research team members is not possible, including situations such as the current pandemic where isolation is due to health and safety concern and not just geographic or cultural factors.    <br/><br/>Students will pursue research projects across a range of interdisciplinary areas that drive the evolution of environmental and social systems. Systems science concepts will integrate projects across the REU, enabling students to identify and understand how dependencies between earth science and other disciplines impact society. Team Science and virtualization of collaboration efforts will engage REU participants in an intensive week-long training bootcamp at ECU?s Coastal Studies Institute in the Outer Banks of North Carolina followed by nine weeks of intensive research. Professional development activities will be structured to enable the students to overcome geographic and cultural barriers to collaboration, thereby providing them a unique skill set to pursue global change research as an effective interdisciplinary team member.

In addition to jewelry, they are also of scientific importance and have emerged as a promising platform for implementing quantum technologies such as quantum networks, sensors, and computers. We propose to further investigate and develop the tin-vacancy (SnV) color center in diamond, which is particularly promising because of its operation at friendlier temperatures (not requiring dilution refrigerators), high efficiency of photon emission, and ability to act as quantum memory and store quantum information. However, for all of these applications it is critical to embed either individual or several color centers inside of photonic structures, in order to implement interfaces to color centers without degrading them. We propose to do this over the course of this project, and to push the limits of such quantum photonic interfaces and interaction between color centers and light with specially engineered diamond structures, new materials processing, and new design techniques. We will demonstrate the interaction of one or a few color center qubits with an optical resonator over the course of this project, which is a key element of many quantum technologies. The proposed research will impact quantum engineering, fundamental physics, and materials science. The project includes educational and outreach activities integrated with research, which the PI has already initiated, including active recruitment students for science and engineering careers, and undergraduate research and advising. <br/> <br/>Technical description<br/> <br/>We propose a 3-year effort focused on developing optically accessible spin qubits with long coherence time, high operation fidelity, efficient light-matter interfaces for long-range interactions, and the potential for high-temperature operation (a few Kelvin, eliminating the need for a dilution refrigerator).

To investigate novel nano-fabrication methods on diamond substrates that enable controllable, strong coupling of a single SnV and several SnV color centers to the cavity.<br/>?	To demonstrate and to investigate single and multi-emitter cavity QED between SnV emitters and a diamond cavity. The demonstration of the strong coupling regime of light-matter interaction is crucial for numerous quantum technologies, and can be used as a building block for quantum network nodes, quantum sensors, and for scalable photonic or spin based quantum computing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Addressing negative beliefs about Black men is an overly simplistic solution because negative beliefs exist about many groups, and yet police shootings disproportionally affect Black men relative to men of other races and ethnicities. This project examines whether the act of shooting occurs quickly and frequently against Black male targets because of an automatic mental association linking Black men and threat, rather than because of a general negative bias. This idea is guided by a model that distinguishes the role of threat (risk of harm) from negative valence (disliking) in reactions to others. The threat vs. valence distinction provides a more nuanced understanding of the maintenance, pervasiveness, and ultimate expression of reactions that contribute to anti-Black shooter behavior. A greater understanding of race-based shooter bias is vital in the present where recent events have made clear the potential deadly consequences of anti-Black prejudice.<br/><br/>The project includes a series of studies that assess automatic mental associations that people have by using state-of-the-art judgment tasks, physiological responses, and shoot behaviors as assessed in an immersive virtual reality shooting task. Several of the studies measure the associations that people have of Black vs. White with threat vs. negativity and test how the relative strength of these associations directly predict shooting behavior. One study relies on the creation of novel associations about unfamiliar target groups to determine if threat associations drive shooting behavior more generally, beyond associations with Black men. A final study disrupts mental associations of Black men with threat (vs. disrupting general Black-negative associations) to determine whether this reduces race-based shooting behavior. The PI has established connections with several police stations to involve officers as research participants and to disseminate findings and feedback among police departments. The project provides a firm understanding of how threat associations contribute to race-based shooter bias and suggests a means by which to begin to redress the negative repercussions of such biases.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

RTIs require real-time aggregation of distributed data streams onto edge/cloud compute servers that can process data as soon as it is generated. The goal of this project is to develop a general mathematical framework as well as concrete algorithms to provide such RTI services with guaranteed latencies. The results benefit the US economy by enabling more efficient, more reliable, and more resilient automation schemes, e.g., for smart factories and farms, as well as improved augmented/virtual reality.

In a first thrust, the project explores the limits of delivering latency-critical services reliably. The establishment of the reliable network stability region provides bounds on how much offered RTI traffic a network can support under the best of all algorithms. A packet-lifetime-based queuing model serves as the basis of Lyapunov-drift-inspired control algorithms that not only account for the packet delay but also takes cost such as energy consumption into account. A second thrust of the project develops robust NextG network control algorithms that can adapt to dynamic network states. Integration of the approaches in the first two thrusts under a common Lyapunov drift control framework is an avenue to enable reliable RTI service delivery, which is verified by the implementation of the algorithm on a Platform for Advanced Wireless Research (PAWR) community testbed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work provides a much-needed integration of various observational datasets with state-of-the-science simulations and has the potential to fill existing knowledge gaps and advance our understanding of how clouds are formed. Clouds over the ocean are particularly important with regard to solar radiation and the energy budget so research examining cloud processes over the ocean will enhance our understanding of our atmosphere and our climate.<br/><br/>This project includes three primary tasks. The first task seeks to identify the conditions under which new particle formation (NPF) occurs and the main drivers of NPF within the marine boundary layer (MBL) via analysis of existing field measurements including airborne and surface (ground site and research cruise) observations. The observational datasets are pulled from field campaigns across the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. The second task seeks to investigate the mechanism behind MBL NPF via state-of-the-science simulations using the large eddy simulation (LES) formulation of the WRF-Chem model constrained by the field observations from the first task. Finally, the third task will run additional WRF-Chem simulations under representative conditions in order to quantify the impact of MBL NPF on cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) and cloud microphysics and the resultant regional impact on MBL clouds. <br/><br/>This effort includes support and training for a postdoctoral researcher.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The central technological innovation that motivates and guides the proposed work is the construction of a Mechanical Atlas, describing the measurement of mechanical stresses, in three dimensions, at single-cell resolution and over time, in a living embryo as it sculpts itself. The investigators will then build on this effort to determine the molecular underpinnings of the observed patterns of stress, and discover rules by which these stressors collectively ensure unique morphogenetic outcomes in ways that are robust with respect to phenotypic and environmental variations. They expect this work will reveal new mechanical design principles for embryonic development, with direct impact on the fields of tissue engineering and organ regeneration. The methodology and tools that will be developed will be shared as open source through github; segmented embryos and the mechanical atlas will be made available to the community through the morphonet browser.<br/><br/>The team of investigators propose to construct a single-cell mechanical atlas, in 3D and in physical units, during the process of gastrulation in the ascidian embryo. To do so, they will solve an inverse problem, grounded in a new physical theory of multicellular aggregates, advanced light-sheet based imaging, and biophysical measurements of material parameters. They will use this mechanical atlas as a foundation to explore how dynamic control of force generation by actomyosin, and dynamic coupling between neighboring cells, encodes robust stereotyped morphogenetic trajectories.  In particular, the investigators will seek to determine 1) communication channels between cells that contribute to the generating the patterns of mechanical forces, 2) the molecular generator(s) of stress, 3) the roles that mechanical forces play in altering how cells communicate, and 4) how the observed patterns of mechanical stress sculpt the macroscopic shape of the organism.

Space weather can pose hazards to electric power grids, telecommunications, spacecraft operations, and astronaut health. This project will advance our understanding of how the Earth?s ionosphere?thermosphere (IT) system changes due to the combined effects of solar variability and changes in the Earth?s lower atmosphere, including extreme weather events such as tornadoes. Understanding IT system variability is an essential element to predict space weather. Extensive historical and ongoing observational data and state-of-the-art weather and geospace models will be used in the investigation.  Graduate and undergraduate students will be integral to the research efforts. The project will develop an online lecture series on space weather, organize virtual workshops for the public, and leverage existing REU, outreach and broadening participation efforts. The collaboration includes Clemson University, Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, New Jersey Institute of Technology, and Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University.<br/><br/>This project studies variations in Earth?s ionosphere-thermosphere (IT) system due to atmospheric waves from both terrestrial sources (including extreme weather) and geomagnetic disturbances triggered by solar activity. The key science questions are: 1) What is the day-to-day IT variability induced by lower-atmosphere waves and persistent geomagnetic disturbances? How do their relative contributions and underlying mechanisms change with locations? 2) What are the multi-scale IT responses to intense space weather and terrestrial convective events? How do their response characteristics compare? and 3) What are the preconditioning effects of atmospheric waves on the IT response to geomagnetic disturbances? A team of researchers active in the geospace CEDAR and GEM communities will investigate these questions. They will use data from a variety of ground-based and space-borne instruments, develop a high-resolution model coupling a general circulation model with a regional wave model, and utilize data assimilation to improve upon the model drivers. Broader impacts of the project include the potential to advance space weather forecasting by characterizing IT system variability. The project will develop a new space weather curriculum and leverage existing education and outreach programs at the collaborating institutions.

The evolutionary significance of HGT in eukaryotes is a fundamental open question in biology. Prior to the advent of next-generation genome sequencing HGT was thought to be common in microbes but limited to eukaryotes with endosymbionts and parasites. Published findings over the last ten years have suggested that both ancient and recent horizontal transfer may be common in eukaryotes but pursuing these scientific questions has been hampered by contamination problems in assembled genome sequences and a lack of appropriate methods for identifying HGT across entire genomes. The most significant questions regarding HGT in eukaryotic evolution are now: (a) How does the likelihood of HGT depend on an organism?s ecology and life history?; and (b) What are the consequences of HGT for evolution? This project will develop the methods necessary to pursue these questions, and distribute freely available software packages that will enable other scientific researchers to use these methods to identify HGT. Reference genome sequences and gene annotations will be produced for 50 nematode species and these data will be made publicly available through WormBase and the National Center for Biotechnology Information Sequence Read Archive. This project will integrate research and education by training early career scientists in computational biology and scientific research through a new, innovative mentored summer research experience at the University of Alabama.<br/><br/>The evolution of self-fertility and asexuality affects important aspects of a species genetics including levels of genetic variation. Sexual reproduction generates new genetic variants through recombination and affects every aspect of organismal evolution. Self-fertility and asexuality may therefore have consequences for HGT as these organisms may use HGT to generate variation. Conversely, outcrossing organisms with separate males and females may be subject to HGT due to endosymbionts and parasites. This project takes a unique, innovative approach to study the relationship between HGT and reproductive mode across Phylum Nematoda and will result in the development of a conceptual framework linking reproductive mode with HGT. These findings will advance understanding of the significance and role of HGT in eukaryotic evolution. HGT-derived genes will be studied in a functional context and these results will contribute to understanding the patterns of environmental selection shaping HGT-derived genes in eukaryotic genomes. This research will result in important discoveries regarding the ways in which reproductive mode and HGT have shaped genome evolution and contribute novel insights to the broader scientific understanding of how evolutionary processes shape genomic patterns. In order to achieve these objectives this project has four specific goals: (1) Develop bioinformatic methods for separating contaminants from true HGT in de novo sequencing projects; (2) Develop a probabilistic approach for identifying HGT in assembled genome sequences; (3) Utilize phylogenetic comparative methods to analyze HGT in outcrossing, self-fertile and asexual organisms; and (4) Develop a new, innovative summer research program for undergraduates, Computational Research Experience at the University of Alabama (CRE@UA).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Preliminary studies indicate that groundwater may supply both dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) and iron in this region. In coastal ecosystems like the West Florida Shelf that have very low nitrate and ammonium concentrations, DON is the main form of nitrogen available to organisms. Nitrogen cycling is strongly affected by iron availability because iron is essential for both photosynthesis and for nitrogen fixation. This study will investigate the sources and composition of DON and iron, and their influence on the coastal ecosystem. The team will sample offshore groundwater wells, river and estuarine waters, and conduct two expeditions across the West Florida Shelf in winter and summer. Investigators will participate in K-12 and outreach activities to increase awareness of the project and related science. The project will fund the work of six graduate and eight undergraduate students across five institutions, furthering NSF?s goals of education and training. <br/><br/>Motivated by preliminary observations of unexplained, tightly-correlated DON and dissolved iron concentrations across the West Florida Shelf (WFS), the proposed work will quantify the flux and isotopic signatures of submarine groundwater discharge (SGD)-derived DON and iron to the WFS, and evaluate the bioavailability of this temporally-variable source using four seasonal near-shore campaigns sampling offshore groundwater wells, estuarine, and riverine endmembers and two cross-shelf cruises. The work will evaluate whether SGD stimulates nitrogen fixation on the WFS, and the potential for the stimulated nitrogen fixation to further modify the chemistry of DON and dissolved iron in the region. The cross-shelf cruises will investigate hypothesized periods of maximum SGD and Trichodesmium abundance (June), and reduced river discharge and SGD (February), thus comparing two distinct biogeochemical regimes. The concentrations and isotopic compositions of DON and dissolved iron, molecular composition of DON, and the concentration and composition of iron-binding ligands will be characterized. Nitrogen fixation rates and Trichodesmium spp. abundance and expression of iron stress genes will be measured. Fluxes of DON and iron from SGD and rivers will be quantified with radium isotope mass balances. The impacts of SGD on nitrogen fixation and DON/ligand production will be constrained with incubations of natural phytoplankton communities with submarine groundwater amendments. Two hypotheses will be tested: 1) SGD is the dominant source of bioavailable DON and dissolved iron on the WFS, and 2) SGD-alleviation of iron stress changes the dominant Trichodesmium species on the WFS, increases nitrogen fixation rates and modifies DON and iron composition. Overall, the work will establish connections between marine nitrogen and iron cycling and evaluate the potential for coastal inputs to modify water along the WFS before export to the Atlantic Ocean. This study will thus provide a framework to consider these boundary fluxes in oligotrophic coastal systems and the relative importance of rivers and SGD as sources of nitrogen and iron in other analogous locations, such as coastal systems in Australia, India, and Africa, where nitrogen fixation and SGD have also been documented.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In Early Jurassic, the Atlantic Ocean began to form as the continental margin of the southeastern United States rifted from northwest Africa. Rifting occurred by mechanical stretching of the crust and lithosphere, potentially with extensive heating and volcanism, before the Mid-Atlantic Ridge started to accommodate extension by seafloor spreading. Old fault lines and sutures of the Appalachian basement may have been reactivated during this continental stretching phase, and lava flows may have filled the early rift basin. Whether this episode of volcanism was a cause or consequence of the breakup between North America and Africa is not yet clear. This question can be addressed with new marine geophysical data that will cover parts of the margin from the continental shelf to the adjacent abyssal plain, a distance of approximately 400 km. With seismic images of the deep sediments and basement, scientists can determine the relationship between basement faults and lava flows on the Carolina Trough, along the coast of the Carolinas, and Blake Plateau, farther south along Georgia and Florida. These two sections of the Atlantic continental margin are of particular interest because the Blake Plateau is much wider than the Carolina Trough. Either the Blake Plateau forms a block of continental crust that did not stretch much during continental rifting, or it is a plateau that largely consists of volcanic rock that formed during rupture of the supercontinent Pangea. The marine geophysical expedition will involve two vessels, the R/V Marcus Langseth and the R/V Neil Armstrong, and ocean-bottom seismometers that will be used to record seismic waves to map subseafloor basement structure. The investigating team will invite students and early-career scientists from other universities to participate in the expedition, and two short courses will be organized to engage early-career scientists in the analysis and interpretation of the data. Although this study focuses on the southeastern United States margin, results will inform ongoing and future studies at other continental margins worldwide.   <br/><br/><br/>The asthenosphere beneath continental rifts can produce large volumes of melt in the presence of deep-seated thermal anomalies, or due to decompression beneath thinning lithosphere. The interactions between lithospheric plate extension and the generation and delivery of magma in this setting are not yet well known. The team of scientists will conduct an active-source seismic investigation of the rifted margins of the southeastern United States to better understand the feedbacks between tectonic extension and magmatism during continental breakup and the onset of seafloor spreading in the central Atlantic Ocean. The continental margin of Blake Plateau is much wider than the adjacent margin of Carolina Trough to the north, suggesting that extension and rupture of continental lithosphere progressed differently at these two adjoining rift segments. Differences in mantle temperature anomalies, mantle melting, and structural inheritance of the continental lithosphere may all have influenced these two contrasting styles of rifting. The investigators seek to address the following three hypotheses: 1) The Blake Plateau Basin stretched much wider than the Carolina Trough Basin before breakup due to a difference in lithospheric thickness. 2) During rifting, the magma supply kept pace with extension of Blake Plateau crust, whereas the continental crust rapidly thinned without extensive magmatism beneath the southern Carolina Trough. 3) At the time of rifting, the deep mantle beneath the Blake Plateau was significantly hotter than the mantle beneath Carolina Trough, which would affect the lithospheric rheology, and the degree of mantle melting. To assess how rift-related processes affected crustal structure and sediment stratigraphy, the science team will gather approximately 4500 km of 2-D seismic reflection data and 900 km of ocean-bottom seismometer (OBS) refraction data with the R/V Marcus Langseth. During this expedition, 39 OBSs from the national Instrument Center (OBSIC) will be deployed with the R/V Neil Armstrong. Images of seismic velocity and reflectivity will provide new insights into the sediment stratigraphy, the geometry of basalt flows and crustal-scale faults, and the thickness and composition of igneous crust. The active-source seismic data and geochemical analyses of existing basalt samples will be used to infer past deformation and the emplacement of intrusive and extrusive crust at the Carolina Trough and Blake Plateau. Students and early-career scientists from other US institutions will be invited to engage in the acquisition and analysis of marine seismic reflection and refraction data on the R/V Neil Armstrong or R/V Marcus Langseth. These sea-going participants will obtain experience in the acquisition and on-board processing of seismic reflection and refraction data.

Animal venoms are key evolutionary adaptations that have originated independently in many animal lineages to assist in defense, predation, and competition. Venoms are some of the most complex secretions known in nature and are made up of toxins and other bioactive compounds whose molecular structure and targets are often similar throughout the animal kingdom. These features make venoms excellent systems to answer fundamental questions in evolutionary biology, and these toxins are untapped resources of novel compounds with great potential for biotechnological applications including drug leads and pesticides. The Venom GRC and GRS will bring together senior and junior researchers from academia and industry to define key areas of venom research, establish collaborations to advance the field, and evaluate challenges and opportunities to achieve a greater impact in basic and applied science. This award will specifically enable early career researchers, including graduate students, postdocs, women and other underrepresented minorities in science, to attend both the 2022 Venom GRS (August 6-7, 2022) and GRC (August 7-12, 2022). This will provide an excellent platform for early career researchers to share their work, while establishing connections and international networks leading to collaborations that will advance venom research. The GRS specifically will aid in this endeavor by concluding with a panel of mentors from industry and academia to offer career advice and discuss their background with attendees, fostering the careers of the future leaders of venom research. <br/><br/>The specific theme of the 2022 Venom GRC and GRS is ?Bridging Gaps in Venom Research: From Ecology and Evolution to Socio-Economic Impacts?. The combined programs include 13 topical sessions featuring invited speakers and selected presentations by both early career and established researchers, and six interactive poster sessions to provide participants with a world-class view of the interdisciplinarity of venom research. The sessions highlight some of the most important challenges and opportunities for collaboration and interdisciplinary innovation in the venom field and include ?Functional Ecology and Biodiversity of Venom?, ?Emerging Models in Venom Research?, ?Toxin Structure and Function? and ?Biomedical and Pesticidal Applications of Venom? among others. The guiding principle of GRC and GRS is to encourage communication, discussion of ideas and unpublished results at the frontier of the field, emphasizing personal interactions and community-building. As such, these GRC and GRS meetings are an outstanding opportunity to build a strong, diverse and cohesive venom research community able to cultivate innovative approaches to address the most important challenges and opportunities for the field of venom research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Previous studies in the McMurdo Dry Valleys, Antarctica suggest that viral infections of microbes, and a general lack of fertilizers (i.e., nutrients), may be important factors shaping the development and functioning of microbial communities in cryoconite holes.  The researchers propose an experimental approach to understand how nutrient limitation affects diversity (number of species) and overall abundance of microbes, and how the diversity and abundance of microbes in turn affects the diversity, abundance, and infection type of viruses that parasitize the microbes in cryoconite sediments.  The researchers will use sediments previously collected from Antarctic glaciers that have varying concentrations of viruses and nutrients, to set up a nutrient-addition experiment to determine how nutrients affect microbial and viral population dynamics. The results will deepen our understanding of how microbial communities in general are shaped by nutrients and viruses and give new insights into the functioning of viruses in extremely cold environments. The researchers will publish their findings in scientific journals and will share their discoveries with K-12 students from rural schools in collaboration with the Pinhead Institute and will connect undergraduate students from under-represented minorities to polar research through participation in the university?s Science, Technology, Engineering & Mathematics Routes Uplift Research Program. Outreach will be achieved through videos produced and distributed by a professional science communicator. The research advances a National Science Foundation goal of expanding fundamental knowledge of Antarctic systems, biota, and processes by utilizing the unique characteristics of the Antarctic region as a science observing platform. <br/><br/>The Principal Investigators propose an experimental approach to understand how nutrient limitation affects microbial diversity and abundances and their cascading effects on virus diversity, abundance, and mode of infection (lysis vs. lysogeny) in Antarctic cryoconite holes. Cryoconite holes are ideal natural microcosms for manipulative studies, not available in other cryospheric ecosystems.  The PIs will use previously collected cryoconite from across a gradient of both viral diversity and nutrient levels to address questions about key limiting nutrients and microbial-viral community dynamics in cryoconite sediments. Nutrient manipulation experiments will be conducted in a growth chamber that closely approximates the light and temperature regime of in situ cryoconite holes to test three core hypotheses: (1) phosphorus availability limits microbial productivity and abundance in cryoconite holes; (2) relaxing nutrient limitation in cryoconite from low-diversity glaciers will increase species diversity, leading microbial communities to resemble those found on more nutrient-rich glaciers; (3) relaxing nutrient limitation will increase the diversity and abundance of viruses by increasing the availability of suitable hosts, and decrease the prevalence of lysogenic infections.  By manipulating nutrient limitation within a realistic range, this project will help verify hypothesized phosphorus limitation of Antarctic cryoconite holes and will extend understanding of the connections between nutrients, diversity, and viral infection dynamics in the cryosphere more generally. A better understanding of these dynamics in cryoconite sediments improves the ability of scientists to forecast future impacts of environmental changes in the cryosphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most new college and university faculty in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) begin their teaching careers with little or no experience with methods of effective pedagogy, including methods for addressing and improving diversity, equity, and inclusion. To remedy this problem in physics and astronomy, the American Association of Physics Teachers, the American Astronomical Society, and the American Physical Society propose to build on and bolster the successful series of Physics and Astronomy Faculty Workshops. With partners from the University of Virginia, the University of Washington (Bothell), and the University of Arizona, the project will implement a significant redesign of the workshops based on what has been learned from participant feedback, workshop evaluations, research into faculty professional development, and the needs of today?s faculty. Effective practices for enhancing diversity, equity and inclusion will be integrated throughout the workshops. In addition to tenure-track faculty, the project will foster the participation of adjunct, part-time, and primarily instructional faculty, who, collectively, teach an increasing fraction of physics and astronomy courses across the country.  <br/><br/>The project redesign will add four new components: (1) a restructured program delivered by a core set of well-prepared presenters, focusing on the development of participants? Individual Development Plans; (2) an overarching emphasis on the professional development of the ?whole faculty member,? as faculty members grow as educators, researchers, and professionals; (3) an enhanced set of post-workshop activities to provide coaching and feedback for the workshop participants as they implement student-centered instructional practices; and (4) a research program focusing on how faculty develop from novices to reflective practitioners in their role as educators. Despite the successes of the New Faculty Workshops to date, studies show that some faculty members do not persist in implementing those pedagogical practices. The redesigned program will directly address this ""implementation dip"" by developing habits of mind that support resilience, reflection, and continuous improvement of teaching, and engaging faculty in an inclusive community of educators that helps them navigate and integrate student-centered teaching practices throughout their careers.  The research and evaluation are designed to inform the improvement of workshops and post-workshop activities and contribute to an understanding of the role of reflective practice in tackling the implementation gap associated with sustaining student centered pedagogical practice in undergraduate STEM education.

Their intensity and size are the two most important matrics for assessing TC severity and potential hazards but their relation is not well understood and challenging to be predicted. The improved understanding of TC intensity-size relation will shed insights into how operational forecasts for TC intensity and size could be further improved. These improvements will in turn help coastal communities to prepare for the maximum potential damage and lead to saving lives and minimizing the losses of properties. This project will train two Ph.D. students and a postdoc in fields of atmospheric dynamics, modeling, and data science, and support STEM education by working with an undergraduate student to launch experimental forecasts for TC intensity and size based on the knowledge gained from the project. The research findings and experimental forecasts will be communicated to the science community via peer-reviewed publications, to college students via classroom teaching and curriculum development, and to general public via website and twitter accounts. <br/><br/>This project is built on the knowledge and insights gained from a previously NSF-funded EAGER project, which put forward a radial invariant model of ?effective absolute angular momentum? (eAAM) for radial profiles of TC surface winds by combining the absolute angular momentum (AAM) and the loss of AAM due to surface drags. The main goal of this project is to explore the dependencies of radial loss of AAM and eAAM values on environment factors so that the eAAM model would better explain the observed complexity and rich diversity of TC intensity-size relation. This research is guided by the central hypothesis substantiated by three process-based working hypotheses. Under this framework, different eAAM values result from differences in the inward radial loss of AAM that depends environment conditions. The central question of how the inward radial loss rate of AAM and eAAM are related to environment conditions is investigated through 6 sets of A-B series numerical experiments using the Cloud Model Version 1 (CM1) model for the A-series and cloud-permitting version of the Weather Research and Forecast (WRF) model for the B-series. The resultant environment-dependent eAAM model will be validated by requiring that both the eAAM-predicted TC winds using observed size information and the eAAM-predicted TC sizes using observed wind information are highly in agreement (within observation uncertainties) with their observational counterparts<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Current reconstructive support devices are not anatomically and functionally patient-specific, do not allow for precise fit, require time-consuming and often multiple surgeries, have sub-optimal tissue ingrowth, and may migrate, causing tissue erosion. Permanent cosmetic implants often need to be ex-planted due to systemic health concerns and adverse immune reactions to the implants. Furthermore, traditional manufacturing is unable to address the needs of traumatic and rare disorder populations due to the prohibitive cost of infrastructure and operational expenditures involved in customizing patient-specific devices. The proposed 3D printed bio-tissue platform allows for customized anatomic and functionally patient-specific devices that may reduce operative time, anesthetic risk, perioperative risk, and patient recovery times. In addition, the proposed technology may provide superior patient outcomes with considerable reduction in costs, surgical time, and hospital stays, which may be a benefit to patients, hospitals, and health insurers.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a 3D bio-tissue platform for the craniofacial reconstruction and augmentation industry with customized, patient-specific devices (including ear, nose scaffolds and spreader grafts).  The proposed 3D printed resorbable bio-tissue technology uses an integrated design and manufacturing process that allows the devices to transition to native tissue over time, reducing the risk of long-term infections and offering safe, reproducible, and predictable aesthetic outcomes.  Multiscale computational simulation software and proprietary toolsare utilized to design structurally-sound implants used as scaffolds in head and neck reconstructive surgery. The safety and efficacy of the 3D printed resorbable bio-tissue technology have been proven with airway support devices implanted in 25 patients under FDA expanded access.

For example, anerobic digestion is used to generate biogas for heating, electricity generation, and to produce methane. Anaerobic digestion with chain elongation has emerged as a promising environmental biotechnology platform for converting organic wastes to high-value chemicals that can serve as chemical building blocks for the manufacturing of polymers and industrially relevant products. During chain elongation, microorganisms combine volatile fatty acids generated from the anaerobic digestion of organic substrates with electron donors such as ethanol or acetate to produce longer chain chemicals. However, the ability to tune and control the product spectrum of chain-elongating microbiomes has remained elusive. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to advance the fundamental understanding of these microbiomes with the ultimate goals of developing new and optimal feedstocks and reactors to tune and control their product distributions. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the generation of new fundamental knowledge to advance the development of a circular bioeconomy using organic wastes as feedstocks. Further benefits to society will be achieved through student education and training including the mentoring of a graduate student and an undergraduate student at the University of Vermont.<br/><br/>Organic wastes such as food and agricultural residues can be converted into high value chemicals such as medium-chain carboxylic acids (MCCAs) using anaerobic digestion with chain elongating microbiomes. However, there are critical knowledge gaps in the fundamental understanding of MCCA generation by chain elongating microbiomes. First, the potential of protein-rich feedstocks for MCCA production is not well understood. Second, the ability to control and tune reverse beta-oxidation pathways that drive the production of MCAAs by chain elongation has remained elusive. Third, tools for modeling MCCA production from complex organic feedstocks are only beginning to emerge. This CAREER proposal will address these critical knowledge gaps. The guiding hypothesis of the proposed research is that anaerobic microbiomes can be controlled and steered to generate MCCAs in a predictable way using amino acid and protein feedstocks. The specific objectives of the proposed research are to: (1) Evaluate amino acid and protein rich substrates and new feeding strategies to tailor and control MCCA production, (2) Design and evaluate new bioreactors for improved MCCA production and extraction, and (3) Develop computational tools to model chain elongation bioprocesses. The successful completion of this project has the potential for transformative impact through the generation of new fundamental knowledge to advance the development of more efficient and cost-effective bioprocesses to recover valuable chemicals from organic wastes while reducing their environmental impact.  To implement the educational and training goals of this CAREER project, the Principal Investigator (PI) will work with the University of Vermont (UVM) Extension 4-H to teach and inspire high school students to explore the use of microbiomes to protect the environment and public health. In addition, the PI plans to develop and teach two new courses at UVM including a course-based undergraduate research experience that focuses on the circular bioeconomy (biorefining) and a graduate course to prepare environmental engineering students to use ?omic? technologies and computational tools to characterize and simulate microbiomes of environmental relevance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to serve the national interest by improving STEM education for Latinx students at two-year Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that Latinx people are the fastest-growing segment, nearly 30%, of the U.S. population, and yet the demand for skilled workers in STEM fields will be difficult to meet unless the nation?s STEM workforce reflects the diversity of the population. While Latinx students have shown to be just as likely as White students to major in STEM, their numbers drop dramatically when it comes to completing STEM degrees, lagging behind other ethnicities.  Two-year HSIs wishing to serve their Latinx students are at the forefront of the efforts to close achievement gaps in STEM education and improve Latinx STEM student outcomes. This project will focus strictly on STEM Planning Teams (faculty, staff, administrators, and students) as Communities of Practice (CoPs) at 16 two-year HSIs as a promising element leading to institutional transformation of STEM teaching and learning. <br/><br/>The project goal is to study the CoPs influence on STEM teaching and learning to transform the institution and signal intentionality to improve outcomes for Latinx STEM students across 2-yr HSIs.  The project scope is to provide 2-yr HSIs with a framework that brings together cross-functional, cross-disciplinary STEM teams to perform college-wide STEM assessments, develop multi-year STEM Plans, and act upon those plans. The framework is a STEM Evidence-based Student Serving (STEM-ESS) self-assessment and planning process that incorporates research outcomes from Subject Matter Experts on Latinx student servingness, equity, and intentionality. STEM teams at participating institutions will be assisted by project leadership and subject matter experts as they self-assess, analyze strengths and gaps, prioritize high impact activities, and develop a strategic STEM plan. In pursuing high impact activities, teams will look to adapt and implement evidence-based solutions and/or develop proposals for federal funding. Regular professional development webinars and workshops are planned for high-impact topics, e.g., undergraduate research at community colleges (CCs), industry connections, and active learning. Individualized and team support will be provided monthly, with more frequent meetings for teams needing additional support. The methodology of this four-year project will validate the STEM-ESS framework using a mixed methods, embedded case study design. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected and analyzed at the individual, CoP, and institutional levels to provide evidence for organizational transformation. Triangulated findings and outcomes of the formative and summative evaluation reports will add new knowledge to the STEM teaching and learning field and advance understanding of how cross-disciplinary and cross-functional STEM CoPs serve as institutional change agents to advance institutional capacity-building for STEM educational equity for Latinx students. Findings will also be disseminated to practitioner- and scholar- focused audiences through virtual, conference, and journal outlets, and collaborations with broader networks.

The formation, structure, and effectiveness of transition metal hydroformylation catalysts supported by a material called black phosphorus are being evaluated to determine if they can be tuned to be more energy efficient and selective than established systems. Additionally, this work is uncovering basic scientific knowledge regarding the design of heterogeneous catalysts supported by the extended network of phosphorus atoms in the most stable form of the element phosphorus. This work is serving as a platform to train a diverse group of graduate and undergraduate students in inorganic chemistry and catalysis. Dr. Velian and her team are creating ?at home? science experiments for middle school and high school students that focus on topics related to inorganic materials and catalysis. Dr. Velian is also actively promoting and exposing students to undergraduate research through a ?Chemistry Frontiers? course. <br/><br/>The most successful hydroformylation catalysts used at industrial scales are homogeneous rhodium catalysts and, to a lesser extent, cobalt catalysts, with hydride, carbonyl, and phosphine ligands. The high price of rhodium and the challenges in recycling homogeneous catalysts make the idea of blending the advantages of homogeneous catalysis and heterogeneous catalysis through the use of single-atom catalysis to be an appealing option for the development of new hydroformylation systems. Dr. Velian and her research group are developing single-atom catalysts for hydroformylation supported by black phosphorus. Activities supporting this over-arching goal include: 1) probing the characteristics of black phosphorous as a support for hydroformylation catalysts and determining how catalytic activity differs from homogenous analogues; 2) evaluating how the unusual stereoelectronic properties of black phosphorus influence the regioselectivity and stereoselectivity of olefin hydroformylation, and 3) determining if black phosphorus can provide a canvas for multi-component single atom catalysts that can work synergistically (i.e. for olefin isomerization and hydroformylation). Further foundational studies are focused on elucidating the nature of black phosphorus as a ligand, and how its unique physicochemical properties can be leveraged in developing next-generation single atom catalysts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

GPDs can shape departmental procedures, enact institutional policies, and disrupt power dynamics between faculty and students. In other words, GPDs are central to improving and sustaining graduate students? mental health and wellbeing. As such, this project will construct a curriculum with GPDs to aid in implementing trauma-informed practices to a large audience of GPDs. The project outcomes will support the improvement and development of proactive interventions to support positive mental health and wellbeing in graduate engineering programs. Improving the systems that support graduate student mental health in engineering programs will enhance recruitment and retention at all levels of engineering education, which in turn addresses the national need of training engineers to address grand challenges. The project results will also raise awareness of graduate mental health in engineering programs by preparing faculty in leadership positions to change the climate in graduate programs directly. These changes will serve as evidence-based models that increase the adoption of practices to support mental health and promote student wellbeing.<br/><br/>This project will examine the mental health crisis by focusing on the role of GPDs in integrating frameworks of care that consider the full range of traumas graduate students have experienced or could experience. The results of this investigation will characterize the roles of engineering GPDs and inform the development of methods to train a community of GPDs to implement evidence-based practices that foster care.

RQ2: How do the systemic structures within higher education impact engineering graduate program directors? implementation of trauma-informed frameworks of care? RQ3: What professional development program features can support engineering graduate program directors? perceived ability to integrate trauma-informed frameworks of care in their approach to supporting graduate students?  Phase 1 will leverage sequential mixed methods through a national survey followed by semi-structured interviews to characterize the roles of engineering GPDs and how programs leverage care practices. Phase 2 will build on these characterizations to collaboratively develop an evidence-based professional development framework for creating trauma-informed systems of care within engineering graduate programs. We will integrate a group coaching professional development approach with collaborative inquiry to explore the lived experiences of the GPDs participating and enable their attempts to foster care in their programs. The research design will expand existing theories for implementing trauma-informed frameworks of care to promote positive mental health and wellbeing within engineering graduate education. The results will inform the practices that faculty and instructors can use to realize the broad impact of trauma and recognize students experiencing, coping, and reacting to trauma. Four broader impacts will emerge from this project: (1) A characterization of GPD roles in engineering that researchers can use to accelerate other educational innovations in graduate engineering education, (2) A prototype developed and disseminated in collaboration with GPDs and an advisory board containing licensed professional counselors that can empower and enable GPDs to respond to students experiencing trauma and to minimize the occurrence of new trauma, (3) Structural changes to support students that have or will experience trauma, so they can return to deep learning and increase their likelihood to persist, and (4) Faculty who can better support systemically minoritized students through the implementation of care practices that respond to students? identity-driven experiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Long and his team at the University of Tennessee-Knoxville are developing mechanistic insight and understanding of a new polymerization methodology called photoinitiated olefin polymerization.  Olefins are small organic molecules composed of carbon and hydrogen in which each carbon is bonded to another carbon through a conventional chemical bond, and another unique bond called a pi-bond.  When this pi-bond is broken, a reactive molecule is created that can add to another olefin.  This process can be repeated many times resulting in the formation of long chain macromolecules, commonly referred to as polymers or plastics.  Plastics have benefited our society in numerous ways.  In fact, plastics has helped aeronautics technology take giant steps forward over the past 70 years, including advancements in satellites, shuttles, aircraft, and missiles.  In addition, the building and construction, electronics, packaging, and transportation industries have all benefited greatly from the use of plastics.  In this research, olefin polymerizations will be initiated by light, in combination with acid and a metal species.  The use of light in these polymerizations is advantageous because it causes cleavage of chemical bonds in non-invasive ways and is environmentally benign.  Sophisticated studies will be conducted in order to mechanistically understand how the combination of these three components can be used to control the polymerization of olefins.  These investigations are expected to provide insight into how plastics are produced with controlled length of polymer chains and architectures.  If successful, the fundamental knowledge gained will enable the chemistry required for many advanced applications such as, for example, olefin-based 3D printable polymers.  The research spans multiple disciplines, including polymer chemistry, polymer science, organometallic chemistry and engineering. Consequently, it will provide a cross-cutting educational opportunity for the students involved.  The research team will also strive to recruit undergraduate students from underrepresented groups through the University of Tennessee-Knoxville SMaRT internship program, as well as Appalachian Students Promoting the Integration of Research and Education (ASPIRE) initiative.  <br/><br/>This research will focus on the use of photoacid generators to activate homogeneous metallocene and post-metallocene catalysts for the controlled polymerization of ethylene, propylene and higher ?-olefins.  To realize this important goal, the first objective will focus on detailed mechanistic and kinetic studies of photoinduced activation of dialkyl substituted zirconium and hafnium pre-catalysts.  The designed strategy will intercept the precatalyst activation pathway by replacing a commonly used Bronsted acid activator with a photoacid generator (PAG).  This PAG/ pre-catalyst mixture will be dormant in the absence of light, but upon irradiation will generate the open coordination site needed for the coordination-insertion polymerization of olefins.  The second objective will apply the generated knowledge and principles to enable control over polyolefin tacticity and molecular weight distribution.  Finally, in the last objective, heterogenous photoinduced initiation of olefin polymerization will be developed with a strong focus on controlling polyolefin film formation on surfaces using a gaseous feed of ethylene or propylene.  If successful, the fundamental studies associated with this research will expand the library of light-based, 3D printable polymer types to include polyolefins.  The knowledge gained from the mechanistic studies will be impactful to organometallic chemistry and catalysis field in general.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, there are many actors ready to steal personal identities, illegally take intellectual property from U.S. companies, and even to make life difficult by interfering with energy supply chains or poisoning water resources. To ensure safety, steps are needed to make certain that there are enough superior cybersecurity experts in the government to guard against such growing threats. By way of this renewal, Marymount University will continue to recruit, educate, and place in government service, a group of excellent students from cybersecurity programs, including programs at community colleges. The grant will support their academic success and readiness for their placement in government service. They will be provided a full scholarship as well as a first-class educational experience (earning a BS, MS, or DSc in Cybersecurity). The program will expand their knowledge, skills, and abilities in cybersecurity so that they can protect all of society as the use of technology continues to grow. <br/><br/>This project builds on the success and experience of the previously funded SFS project and will be guided by five objectives. First, is to continue to recruit a well-qualified group of students at all levels. Second is to ensure the highest levels of development of the students for government work. Third is to retain and graduate all students with a minimum GPA of 3.5 and facilitate 100% placement in government positions. Fourth is to develop professionals capable of designing, building, and managing secure information systems for the connected world. Finally, it is to evaluate the extent to which enhanced student-faculty interactions, mentoring, community outreach, and joint involvement in research contributes to positive workplace outcomes in the field of cybersecurity. Marymount has increased the effectiveness and sustainability of its programs by implementing an agile curriculum process to keep pace with emerging technologies such as artificial intelligence and cloud computing. These curriculum changes are informed by workforce studies including a detailed understanding of the federal government needs, and by alliances with larger public institutions for research and resources.

The similarities and differences in how these attributes are measured and their relationships to STEM education outcomes have not been rigorously examined. This interdisciplinary multi-country study will investigate the evolution and co-evolution of traits, EF skills, and preferences in children to determine how those attributes predict STEM achievement and the choice of STEM majors and careers. In particular, it will use a common measurement framework across samples from three sites in the United States and China, as well as data from the Australian Household, Income and Labour Dynamics Survey, to find out how personal attributes are related to STEM education achievement, college attainment and STEM major choice. It will provide a better understanding of age-specific windows of opportunity for interventions promoting STEM achievement and the pursuit of STEM majors. This study will produce core sets of distinct attributes to use in assessing students and schools, which will be useful as a diagnostic tool for teachers and school administrators to counsel students and to facilitate personalized learning. Students may reap the academic and social benefits of teaching interventions focused on the impact of traits, skills, and preferences. <br/><br/>The main goal of this study is to identify the combination of traits, EF skills, and preferences for predicting STEM achievement (grades, test scores, teacher ratings, as well as choice of college major and career). To do this, first the study will generate a parsimonious measurement system of personal attributes by conducting linear and nonlinear factor analysis to determine the relationship and dimensionality of traits, EF skills, and preferences. Second, it will collect data on these personal attributes in different experimental conditions to quantify how incentives, frames and contextual factors affect their measurement, in order to propose standardized measures for personal attributes that predict STEM outcomes. Third, it will examine trait, skill, and preference growth longitudinally, spanning cohorts from 4th to 12th grade, for both mean change and change in the prediction of STEM outcomes. Finally, it will examine how background factors including geo-cultural settings moderate the relationship between STEM outcomes and traits, EF skills, and preferences. This study makes five major contributions to STEM education research: (1) The longitudinal measurement furthers our understanding of age-specific windows of opportunity for interventions promoting attributes that drive interest in STEM; (2) Examination of relationships across the elicited measures enables determination of which measurement strategies capture the same constructs, and which add genuine new dimensions to the study of individual differences. This study will use a common set of measures across countries; (3) For each construct, use of experimental manipulations enables investigation of the quantitative importance of standardizing for incentives and environments; (4) By studying the power of the various elicited, standardized measures for predicting STEM achievement, college attainment, and STEM major and career choices, this study will support schools and teachers to promote personalized education and improve student outcomes; and (5) The study of similarities and differences in measures across cultural, race, ethnicity, gender, and family background, allows for optimal prediction of STEM outcomes  across distinct contexts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An important aspect of model theory is to study the underlying structure of mathematical objects from a formal viewpoint, and then to utilize this to obtain novel approaches to questions emerging from other areas of mathematics, such as algebra, geometry, arithmetic, differential equations, graph theory, or even beyond, such as from economics, machine learning or engineering. The particular focus of this project is on developing recent applications of certain model-theoretic tools to areas such as diophantine geometry (the study of solving equations in integers by means of algebra and geometry) and asymptotic analysis (the study of the growth behaviour of functions as their inputs become large), in order to obtain new insights in these different fields by exploring and profiting from the interplay between them, while also making fundamental contributions to our understanding of the foundational model-theoretic framework itself. The project includes the training of undergraduate and graduate students, including those from underrepresented groups through the Math Alliance. <br/><br/>The prevalent feature of the problems that this project proposes to address is their connection to the part of model theory known as o-minimality, a common generalization of semi-algebraic and subanalytic geometries, where the mathematical objects under consideration do not exhibit wild geometric behaviour (such as no oscillation, finiteness bounds being uniform in families, and good asymptotic growth behaviour of functions). A principal focus of this project is on the counting theorem of Pila and Wilkie, a seminal application of o-minimality to diophantine geometry, as well as on subsequent refinements and applications of this result. One key aim is to gain new insights into one of the main analytic-geometric tools used in this area, namely smooth parameterization. Another is to obtain further improvements to or new applications of these counting results, in particular by exploiting effective methods. This project moreover will use techniques from o-minimality to address questions in diophantine and asymptotic analysis, by furthering our understanding of the asymptotic growth behaviour of functions in the o-minimal setting, and making critical new insights into the wider applicability of this analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To maintain this relentless increase in data rates we need to harness every technological feature available to us, and utilize it to the maximum extent. A particular challenge is improving wireless communications in enclosed environments, like a room or building, where the signals reverberate in a chaotic manner and appear to be hopelessly scrambled, as compared to free space propagation. One approach is to use a programmable wall or ceiling-mounted pixelated surface to literally mold the reverberating waves to increase the data transfer rates to targeted receivers. The science and technology of reliably improving the data rates is the subject of this work. This science is advanced through intelligent use of the random reverberant properties common to all enclosed spaces, combined with wave control enabled by our programmable pixelated surfaces. The outcome is further improvement of wireless communication data rates even in situations where present-day technology is severely handicapped, or fails to operate altogether. This project provides enhanced infrastructure for research and education by developing a multi-institutional effort sharing the proven techniques and experiences of all partners, thus intertwining engineering culture and liberal arts culture.<br/><br/>The extraordinary complexity and sensitivity generated by multiple scattering and the consequent interference of many ray paths in spectrally crowded reverberant settings is typically considered anathema for resilient communications and spectrum management. This effort aims to invert this narrative, by developing novel reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) that take advantage of this complexity to harvest the enormous number of environmental degrees of freedom in order to actively modify, and control, the electromagnetic environment. The developed RIS is able to manipulate, both spatially and temporally, the wavefronts reflected from them in order to create hot- or cold-spots in real space, and they enable frequency-shifting of signals to specific users for advanced spectrum management. They also rapidly adjust to disruptive events using stochastic algorithms together with machine learning techniques. In addition, cells within the RIS are designed using RF and mixed signal circuits, antennas, and components to capture disruptive short pulse events that can occur randomly through the interaction of broadband signals, or due to a deliberate attack on the network, supporting adaptive and resilient communications. The outcome is a more robust and capable wireless communication network that fuels further innovations in wireless content and usage, resulting in increased satisfaction for the user.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Important questions to be addressed include: How do hydrological, hydrothermal and/or volcanic systems respond to climate change and glacier expansion and retreat? What are the timing and mechanisms that control these responses? Answering these questions has significant impacts on hazard assessments (phreatic eruptions and hydrothermal explosions), geothermal exploration, and mineral deposits. El Tatio volcanic-hydrothermal system, Central Andes, provides an ideal natural laboratory to investigate these interactions. El Tatio has been active since the last deglaciation and preserves exceptional morpho-stratigraphic evidence of volcanic, glacial, and hydrothermal activity. Unlike past studies, focusing on large continental ice masses during the Last Glacial Maximum, El Tatio experienced smaller alpine or mountain glaciations. That configuration is more representative of the world-wide distribution of glaciers and the processes occurring due to modern climate change. Led by an early career Latino-woman, this project will intensify collaborations with Chilean Universities, and will engage historically marginalized native communities who own the land.<br/><br/>This project will use an interdisciplinary approach that brings together experts from different US institutions and Chile, which propose to address the following: (i) to establish spatial and temporal linkages between glacier fluctuations including deglaciation and the onset of hydrothermal and/or volcanic activity by constraining the field distribution and timing of different events; and (ii) to make quantitative estimation of the hydrothermal responses to glacial unloading, changes in water and heat supply using field data (ages and estimation of ice thickness) and numerical models of multiphase flow and deformation in heterogeneous porous media.

Understanding current misinformation content and trends supports both corporate entities and social media users. For corporations, th proposed suite of tools may show how misinformation impacts businesses by exploring and forecasting public sentiment concerning relevant misinformation topics. This analysis may provide value to these agencies by shifting resources from manual identification to analyzing the content and implications of misinformation posts.

Potential customers may be drawn to this proposed technology since information demand is met from grassroots organizations, which can be inconsistent with data quality. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of automated data collection, data analytics, and deep learning methodologies. The goal is to develop an application and associated website that centralizes up-to-date misinformation content and metrics.

Currently, an array of tools to interact with misinformation content is under development. Pipelines are being constructed to channel and store raw data using the selenium framework for the collection step. Thesedata are stored locally and will act as the raw information  to support the finalized dashboard. Deep learning models that are trained to identify text-based misinformation have been developed with the goal of expanding to image, sound, and video identification to address current social content trends.

While granted these powers by law and political tradition, the Court?s legitimacy in making these weighty decisions rests, in no small part, on the public accepting that the Court is ?above? politics. In other words, despite creating ?winners? and ?losers? when issuing decisions, ordinary people seem to believe two things: (1) the Court?s members were chosen via fair, democratic processes, and (2) differences in opinion are due to conflicting Constitutional interpretations rather than the naked partisan preferences of Justices. These assumptions, however, have been sorely tested in recent years. From brutal, polarized confirmation hearings to questions about candidates? fitness to serve, and controversial, highly visible decisions, some citizens may not see the Court as the same backstop for democratic values that it was in the mid-20th Century. These developments raise thorny questions about the sources of public support for the Supreme Court more generally. We investigate whether citizens? democratic beliefs are connected to their views about the Court?s legitimacy, and, in turn, whether those attitudes are affected by the Court?s decisions.<br/><br/>To explore the relationship between public views about democracy and their support for the Court, this research will deploy a four-wave panel survey that will allow researchers to (1) test whether democratic values correspond to diffuse support via a rigorous panel design and, (2) analyze whether highly salient decisions affect the Court?s legitimacy, generally, and whether such decisions affect the relationship between democratic values and Court support, specifically. By collecting a combination of original survey, panel, and experimental data, this research supplies a rare opportunity to obtain contemporaneous public reactions to a series of high-profile decisions that the Court will most likely issue during the summer of 2022, which bookends a period of sincere political and democratic upheaval. Despite political scientists? concern about democratic backsliding, insufficient attention has been paid to the role of the judiciary in deepening public cynicism about democracy. This research not only represents a significant step forward in understanding basic theories of why citizens respect the Supreme Court?s legitimacy, but it offers a chance to analyze how a potentially counter-majoritarian political institution may be contributing to this country?s ongoing crisis of democracy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Electrocatalytic processes can store electrical energy from renewable energy sources in the form of liquid or gaseous fuels from abundant, renewable feedstocks such as carbon dioxide or biomass. A principal hurdle for the adoption of this technology is the poor product selectivity of these reactions. These reactions are complex and occur at an interface involving a liquid (the electrolyte) and a solid (the electrode). In this work, the project team will modify this interface, and thus the electrocatalytic activity, by coating the electrodes with a special class of porous material known as metal-organic frameworks (MOFs). The project team will use spectroscopy and advanced computer simulations to gain molecular-level insights into the effects of the MOF overlayers on three model reactions that are central for renewable fuel synthesis: The conversion of water to hydrogen, the conversion of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide, and conversion of biomass to valuable chemicals and fuels. The results of this research will provide insight into the control of selectivity of electrocatalytic reaction. Further, the team will engage in synergistic activities aimed at promoting the recruitment and retention of underrepresented groups in STEM. Specifically, the team will involve female high-school students and underrepresented undergraduate minority students in this research as part of a summer program, which will expose the participants to state-of-the-art renewable energy research in the areas of synthesis, analytical chemistry, and simulation techniques.<br/><br/>On this project, Matthias Waegele and Junwei (Lucas) Bao of Boston College and Mariam Ismail of the University of Massachusetts, Boston are studying and designing 3D active sites at the metal electrode/porous 3D material interface to facilitate desirable reaction pathways of proton-coupled electron transfer (PCET) processes for energy storage and conversion. To this end, the team will coat metal electrodes (Pt and Au) with crystalline metal-organic framework (MOF) overlayers and investigate the effects of the MOF overlayers on PCET processes. Through systematic variation of the inorganic nodes and organic linkers of the MOFs, the team will aim to understand the effect of the MOF?s chemical and physical properties on PCET. The project will focus on the hydrogen evolution reaction (HER) and the reduction of carbon dioxide to carbon monoxide. Vibrational and Raman spectroscopies will be used to characterize the metal electrode/MOF interface under catalytic conditions. Key properties to be extracted from these measurements will include the interfacial pH, electric double layer charging, MOF-intermediate interactions, interfacial water structure, and local structure of the MOF at the metal surface. Computer simulations will map minimum-energy reaction pathways. On the basis of these investigations, the project aims to establish robust interfacial property-reactivity relationships.

Understanding charge transport is vital to pursuing new developments in areas considered critically important to long-term national economic success including electronics, solar energy, and materials development. Nanoscale organic electronic devices display unique charge transport properties that can be used to design improved electronic devices (ex. transistors, resistors), but it is challenging to describe charge transport in many of these devices using existing computational methods. The joint Rowan and Butler team will develop new computational tools for generating the charge transport data needed to design the next generation of electronic devices based on non-classical charge transport effects. The developed computational tools will be incorporated into the OpenMolcas software package, which is widely used in both educational and research efforts. Both Butler University and Rowan University have strong commitments to undergraduate education, and a core educational outcome of this project is the development of computationally-engaged undergraduate students fit for either academic or industry positions. Through student recruitment partnerships with mentorship programs and local community colleges, this project provides a pathway into research for students from non-traditional backgrounds and underrepresented groups in the computational sciences.<br/><br/>Nanoscale organic electronic devices that operate at the single-molecule level are a key experimental platform for enhancing the scientific community?s understanding of charge transport at the quantum level. Created by combining single organic molecules with metal or carbon-based electrodes, single-molecule devices hold the potential to be the foundation for the next generation of transistors, resistors, and switches for nanoscale electronics. Large gaps remain in our theoretical understanding of non-classical charge transport effects in nanoscale electronics such as the reversal of the expected electrical conductance decay with increasing molecular length. A key reason for this is the limited treatment of electron-electron interactions (electron correlation) by existing transport methods particularly strong/multireference correlation. To resolve this, the Hoy/Sand research team will develop a fully-quantum family of multiconfigurational charge transport methods based on multiconfiguration pair density functional theory (MC-PDFT) combined with the non-equilibrium Green?s function formalism (NEGF). Key objectives include the development of new MC-PDFT-based effective Hamiltonians and self-consistent optimization schemes for multiconfigurational Green?s function transport theories. The integration of these developments within an open-source modular Python framework allows for the characterization of multireference correlation effects in quantum transport phenomena. Using these NEGF-MCPDFT methodologies, the team will investigate including reversed conductance decay, Coulomb blockades, and Kondo Resonances to enhance the scientific community?s understanding of quantum charge transport phenomena.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite the enormous investments in research and development, there have been scant clinical successes as a viable cancer therapy. Recent advancements in cancer therapy have resulted in the emergence of implanted medical devices (IMDs) into feasible medicines, owing to their capacity to localize treatments, albeit limited in numbers. However, currently available IMDs-mediated cancer treatments are often confined to a single, non-replenishable administration per therapy. These limitations, along with a number of risks such as painful surgery, infection risk in the catheter, and device failure, have generally hampered the usage of IMDs in cancer treatment. More importantly, cancer cannot be effectively managed with a single therapeutic approach due to its complex, diverse, and heterogeneous nature. As such, this CAREER project investigates a versatile engineering solution in the form of an acoustically driven implantable microsystem that provides a tailored combination of multimodal cancer therapeutics: oxygen, chemotherapy drugs, and light. Combined, this project aims to establish the field of ?Acousto-Bioelectronics? that spurs new theory and understanding for the next generation of IMDs. Furthermore, the project integrates the research with educational venues by mentoring graduate and undergraduate students, with a particular emphasis on the underrepresented minorities and female students, developing interdisciplinary curricula, and creating pedagogical resources ranging from fundamental theory to hands-on activities.<br/><br/>While IMDs are transforming modern healthcare, they are unable to cure cancer at the moment due to their short lifetime. This is compounded by the fact that many cancers can relapse or spread metastatically. The overarching goal of this CAREER project is to leverage cross-cutting innovations from the domain of engineering and healthcare fields to create an ultrasonically-powered implantable microsystem that enables a tailored combination of multimodal cancer therapies. This study (1) elucidates the untapped potential of Platonic solid structures for a highly efficient omnidirectional ultrasonic powering scheme for IMDs, utilizing a unique 3D-printable barium titanate ultrasonic receiver. (2) Providing adequate power via ultrasound, the microsystem enables the in-situ generation of oxygen, cisplatin, and light through controlled electrochemical and photochemical processes. It is hence called Oxygen Enhanced Chemo-Photodynamic Therapy. (3) The microsystem can potentially realize clinically-proven superadditive anticancer effect ? stronger than any single therapy or theoretical combination. The microsystem-mediated multimodal cancer therapy would be validated through a comprehensive evaluation by employing clinically relevant models (in vitro and in vivo cancer models). The outcome of this project justifies the development of the IMD-mediated multimodal cancer therapy that will potentially help patients suffering from aggressive and fatal cancer types with limited treatment alternatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Stigma, a strong feeling of disapproval, of MHCs is a society-wide issue that tends to conflict with help-seeking attitudes of those having MHCs. Engineering is known as a demanding field, where a culture of high stress and endurance is often promoted, with specific challenges to socialization, especially for members of marginalized groups. These factors tend to be linked to the onset and persistence of MHCs. Nevertheless, it is known that while engineering students do not have a higher prevalence of MHCs, those that have them are less prone to seek help than those in other professional areas. This project will explore elements of the engineering culture that may reinforce stigmatized views of MHCs, therefore limiting the ability of students and early professionals to seek help when they need it. This study will explore the experiences of students and early professionals to understand elements of the engineering culture that influence their internalized stigma, interest to learn about MHCs, and ability to help others. The project team will pay attention to students' interactions with other actors such as faculty and administrators to explore how the beliefs about MHCs are perpetuated in engineering education spaces. This study has the potential to bring valuable insights into professional cultures and how they interact with the prevalence and management of MHCs, such as key dynamics, contexts, and interactions that might promote negative views of MHCs.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to identify elements of engineering culture that influence the stigma of MHCs and consequently affect the help-seeking attitudes of students and early professionals. This will be achieved through a three-year longitudinal sequential mixed methods study. Each year the relationship between the stigma of MHCs and help-seeking attitudes will be measured quantitatively through a survey with established instruments. The results of the first-year survey will be analyzed under the principles of maximum variability to inform our longitudinal multi-case study that will use thematic and narrative analyses. The longitudinal quantitative analysis will examine the evolution of the considered relationships through the years of the participants? engineering training and transition to professional life, and how they are moderated by their characteristics, perceptions of engineering culture, engineering identity, and sense of belonging. This longitudinal approach will explore the important transition point where engineering students leave academic spaces to engage in their first professional experiences and its impact on their mental well being. The research design will also enable the study of how the outlook of students without MHCs evolves through time. Since MHCs can develop at any point in life and many elements of college life, including those specific to engineering training, have been linked to poor mental health outcomes, the result of this project have the potential to identify elements from learning and practicing engineering that could contribute to the onset of MHCs. Project results will contribute to advancing equity and inclusion in engineering through the comprehensive description of the challenges experienced by students and early professionals with MHCs. Since engineering students and professionals with other marginalized identities in engineering are more likely to experience MHCs, project results will have the potential to illustrate the specific challenges navigated by such groups. A partnership with the National Alliance of Mental Illness (NAMI) will enable a national reach of audiences in and out universities that will be supported through some of their established initiatives.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Statistical methods find application in myriad areas, including biomedical research, environmental science, finance, marketing, psychology, public health, and genomics. Within statistics, the Bayesian approach offers many appealing features: Bayesian methods provide a coherent framework for integrating information from different sources and communicating findings and conclusions using probabilities; Bayesian hierarchical models can capture different sources of variability in data and processes; relevant knowledge can be incorporated easily; and all relevant uncertainties are coherently propagated and incorporated into the final inference. Consequently, Bayesian analyses are commonplace across a wide variety of application areas. ISBA 2022 will bring together a diverse international community of researchers and practitioners who develop and use Bayesian statistical methods to share recent findings, exchange ideas, and discuss new, challenging questions. As a truly international meeting, it will provide participants with access to ideas and colleagues from other countries with whom they may not ordinarily interact.

The goal is to include dynamics and its effect on protein function in structure-based protein design processes and eliminate current limitations in the design of efficient enzyme catalysts. This promises to enable the design of tailored enzymes that catalyze novel reactions and replace energy and cost intensive processes in the synthesis of valuable compounds. The key development will be a series of new algorithms that capture anharmonic low-frequency motions of proteins in all-atom computer simulations. The computational nature of this project is further used to developed research opportunities for online undergraduate students that can be carried out remotely.<br/><br/>Protein structure has long been regarded as the key determinant of protein function, for example, the ability of enzymes to catalyze a specific chemical reaction. However, an increasing body of evidence shows that structure alone is insufficient to explain the catalytic efficiency of many enzymes, whose activity instead relies on the co-existence of multiple distinct conformations and the transitions between them. While the accuracy of sequence-based protein structure predictions has seen dramatic recent improvements and strategies exist to tackle the inverse problem of designing amino acid sequences that fold into pre-selected structural motifs, our current ability to predict the functional dynamics of protein is limited even once the structure is known. All-atom molecular dynamics simulations provide a model with sufficient microscopic detail, but the computational costs associated with the sampling of conformational fluctuations limits their application to a small number of systems. On the other hand, coarse-grained models and inelastic network models are computationally efficient but lack microscopic detail. Here, we propose a new set of methods to extract collective protein degrees of freedom susceptible to large-scale motion from fluctuations in all-atom molecular dynamics simulations on timescales that are accessible to high-throughput simulations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to serve the national interest by improving STEM education for Latinx students at two-year Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs). The U.S. Census Bureau estimates that Latinx people are the fastest-growing segment, nearly 30%, of the U.S. population, and yet the demand for skilled workers in STEM fields will be difficult to meet unless the nation?s STEM workforce reflects the diversity of the population. While Latinx students have shown to be just as likely as White students to major in STEM, their numbers drop dramatically when it comes to completing STEM degrees, lagging behind other ethnicities.  Two-year HSIs wishing to serve their Latinx students are at the forefront of the efforts to close achievement gaps in STEM education and improve Latinx STEM student outcomes. This project will focus strictly on STEM Planning Teams (faculty, staff, administrators, and students) as Communities of Practice (CoPs) at 16 two-year HSIs as a promising element leading to institutional transformation of STEM teaching and learning. <br/><br/>The project goal is to study the CoPs influence on STEM teaching and learning to transform the institution and signal intentionality to improve outcomes for Latinx STEM students across 2-yr HSIs.  The project scope is to provide 2-yr HSIs with a framework that brings together cross-functional, cross-disciplinary STEM teams to perform college-wide STEM assessments, develop multi-year STEM Plans, and act upon those plans. The framework is a STEM Evidence-based Student Serving (STEM-ESS) self-assessment and planning process that incorporates research outcomes from Subject Matter Experts on Latinx student servingness, equity, and intentionality. STEM teams at participating institutions will be assisted by project leadership and subject matter experts as they self-assess, analyze strengths and gaps, prioritize high impact activities, and develop a strategic STEM plan. In pursuing high impact activities, teams will look to adapt and implement evidence-based solutions and/or develop proposals for federal funding. Regular professional development webinars and workshops are planned for high-impact topics, e.g., undergraduate research at community colleges (CCs), industry connections, and active learning. Individualized and team support will be provided monthly, with more frequent meetings for teams needing additional support. The methodology of this four-year project will validate the STEM-ESS framework using a mixed methods, embedded case study design. Quantitative and qualitative data will be collected and analyzed at the individual, CoP, and institutional levels to provide evidence for organizational transformation. Triangulated findings and outcomes of the formative and summative evaluation reports will add new knowledge to the STEM teaching and learning field and advance understanding of how cross-disciplinary and cross-functional STEM CoPs serve as institutional change agents to advance institutional capacity-building for STEM educational equity for Latinx students. Findings will also be disseminated to practitioner- and scholar- focused audiences through virtual, conference, and journal outlets, and collaborations with broader networks. The NSF IUSE: EHR Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Institutional and Community Transformation track, the program supports efforts to transform and improve STEM education across institutions of higher education and disciplinary communities.

Understanding the convergence rate of Markov chains to their equilibrium distribution is crucial for the efficiency and accuracy of scientific studies utilizing MCMC algorithms.  This project focuses on the design and analysis of fast algorithms for randomly sampling from distributions defined on exponentially large combinatorial sets.   This is a fundamental task that arises in a variety of scientific fields; some common examples include: Bayesian inference which is a key tool in machine learning, computer vision, and evolutionary biology; the study of the equilibrium state of idealized physical systems in statistical physics; and  the design of algorithms for counting and sampling problems in theoretical computer science.   The education plan of this project includes an interdisciplinary summer school at the University of California Santa Barbara to train graduate students on recent developments in the research area.<br/><br/>This project will introduce new techniques for proving optimal convergence rates of Markov chains. The focus is an exciting new technique known as spectral independence, which measures the pairwise influences in graphical models or spin systems, and implies optimal mixing time bounds for a variety of Markov chains.  This project will enhance the technique by strengthening the implications of spectral independence and extend its applicability by presenting new tools for establishing spectral independence.  These improved techniques will yield new connections between various algorithmic approaches for approximate sampling and counting problems.  In addition, this project will formalize connections between the computational complexity of approximate counting problems on general graphs with statistical physics phase transitions on trees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The drug resulting from this project will be first-in-class comprehensive treatment for hyperoxaluria (high urine oxalate), hyperoxalemia (high blood oxalate), and related calcium oxalate kidney stones (COKS). Millions of patients suffering from COKS will finally be able to prevent this painful and damaging disease and preserve their long-term kidney health. Since a single kidney stone increases the risk of kidney failure, payers will not only appreciate the annual savings on treatment, but also the economic benefits of preventing chronic kidney disease (CKD) and kidney failure requiring permanent dialysis, affecting ~45 M and ~500 K patients in the US, respectively. Importantly, it will also impact the outcome of other disorders potentially affected by oxalate, including CKD and its progression, progression of cyst growth in autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease, kidney disease-associated cardiovascular diseases, and poor renal transplant survival. <br/><br/>This STTR Phase II project aims to develop the oral route component of an innovative drug delivery system using peptide-loaded NPs for localized and sustained delivery of novel therapeutic peptides to the intestinal mucosa to address oxalate-related disorders. This project will: (1) Develop and characterize multiple NPs formulations. (2) Ensure that the peptide-loaded NPs are largely delivered to the small and large intestines, but not to the stomach. (3) Confirm that the NPs have no cellular toxicity in vitro. (4) Confirm that NPs significantly reduce plasma and urinary oxalate levels in hyperoxalemia and hyperoxaluric mice without causing significant in vivo toxicity, and achieving no or minimal systemic absorption. (5) Obtain initial safety data for the peptide-loaded NP via an exploratory preclinical toxicology study. At least one of the developed NP formulations should deliver the peptides to the small and large intestines, present no significant cellular toxicity in vitro, and reduce plasma and urinary oxalate levels without causing significant in vivo toxicity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By this logic, the very quiet L?Hoest?s monkeys are an anomaly because, despite being highly social, they appear to produce only 10% of the expected number of call types. New preliminary evidence contradicts previous assumptions that this species is merely quiet. Instead, most of its communication may be concentrated within such low frequencies that they are inaudible to humans ? i.e., infrasound. This study is designed to produce high-quality recordings of L'Hoest's monkey calls to document routine use of infrasound for within-group communication. The recordings can be disseminated through publicly accessible, online repositories. The data can inform future studies of physical mechanisms by which relatively small-bodied mammals produce and perceive such signals, the environmental and social pressures likely to have shaped this communication system, and whether related species also use infrasound. The project will advance training and mentoring of undergraduates, including individuals from underrepresented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>L?Hoest?s monkeys face two conflicting challenges: as relatively small-bodied, terrestrial animals, they need to reduce the severe risk of predation by felids and other carnivores; yet the dense vegetation of their preferred habitats limits their visual contact with group-mates, necessitating reliance on acoustic signals to maintain group cohesion. This species may have adapted to these pressures through the use of low-frequency vocalizations that are likely to be inaudible to predators. Specialized equipment is necessary to create sound files as evidence of these signals and to explore their characteristics, because standard equipment is unable to reliably detect signals outside the range of human hearing. These audio files are paired with simultaneous video and distance measurements to nearby animals. Together, these records are used to (1) make a preliminary assessment of the number of call types that occur in the infrasonic (<20Hz) and near-infrasonic (20-40Hz) frequencies, (2) describe the acoustic characteristics of these calls, (3) document the behavioral context associated with specific calls, and (3) determine the transmission distance of low-frequency signals.

This is relevant in the context of global climate change where extreme flooding is expected to occur more frequently and at larger magnitudes. Many of the modern structures that were damaged during the flooding in Germany are similar to structures found across the United States and knowledge gained from studying this flooding event will be transferable to the built environment in the United States.

Through this data collection, a detailed set of case studies that document sediment dynamics in the vicinity of infrastructure and in urban river sections will facilitate identification of features and processes that potentially influence performance of engineered structures during extreme flooding. Geophysical field measurements in the riverbed will include rotary side scan sonar, high resolution chirp sonar, and single beam sonar. This will enable collection of channel bathymetry and sediment stratigraphy, which may reveal novel information on if or how changes in substrata in the upper meter of the river bed play a significant role in sediment mobilization and instability during extreme hydraulic events.

The COVID-19 pandemic made it clear that technology to enable remote learning is critical to education at all levels. However, instructors often do not use these technologies because they lack understanding of how to meaningfully deploy it in their courses. In order for VR to be useful in education, it must not just be easy for learners to use, but also must be easy for instructors to learn to use it. This project will create a user-friendly toolkit with which educators can create targeted, subject-specific, VR educational experiences. This learning tool may become an important part of future education as it will provide access for a diverse group of students of all ages and education levels who may be unable to be physically present (due to illness, location, or other social or socio-economic obstacles) to complete courses and curricula where on-site attendance is not possible.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project fills an industry gap and unaddressed demand for educational simulations. Studies of students and instructors have shown that both want VR experiences as part of a broader demand for consumable instructional content. Developing this content, however, presents two interconnected technical hurdles: (1) developing pipelines by which existing digital resources can be used to create VR assets, and (2) creating a holistic user experience for non-technical users in the non-standardized computing environment of K-12 and higher education. Current state-of-the-art VR systems are often too complicated for non-technical users, requiring the user to have extensive programming skills, which many educators do not. This project seeks to develop methods to easily create VR assets from non-VR digital resources and a user experience (UX) structured around the ?backward design? approach to instructional design. By building on the latest functionality for gestural interfaces to reflect interactions with physical spaces and objects, and developing templates to guide the instructional designer through the process, this project will enable instructional designers to develop realistic, compelling, and educationally valuable VR learning experiences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate change is expected to result in more frequent and severe periods of heat stress that will significantly reduce yields from agricultural crops. Simultaneously, projections indicate that world-wide food production must increase by more than 70% to feed an expected increase in the global human population to 10 billion by 2057. To meet the growing food demands it is critical that we develop crop plants that are more tolerant to heat stress conditions (i.e., the new normal). The proposed project aims to better understand how plants remodel their lipid membranes during heat stress, with a specific focus on a family of enzymes that flip lipids across membranes (lipid flippases). The research goals include engineering selected lipid flippases to be more active and testing whether these modified enzymes can accelerate the rate in which plants remodel their membranes to cope with changing temperatures.  The research will determine whether this ?faster membrane remodeling? strategy has any positive effect on plant growth, fertility, and seed yield under heat stress conditions. If successful, this technology could be applied to crop species and potentially improve yields under heat-stress conditions, thus strengthening global food-security in a warming world. Additionally, the research will provide a venue for teams of undergraduate student researchers to gain in-depth research experience in the field of plant biology. <br/><br/>The long-term scientific goal is to understand the cellular functions of lipid flippases in eukaryotic cells and to use that knowledge to develop strategies to make crop plants more climate resilient. In plants, lipid flippases are referred to as ALAs (Aminophospho-Lipid ATPases, or P4-type ATPases) and these enzymes utilize ATP hydrolysis to catalyze the flipping of specific lipids from one side of the membrane to the other. Genetic knockouts of several ALAs in Arabidopsis result in plants that are hypersensitive to temperature changes. The central hypothesis guiding the research is that lipid flippases play critical roles in the rapid remodeling of membranes in response to changing temperatures. The first aim is to use domain swapping and site specific mutagenesis to identify important regulatory features within different ALAs. A key hypothesis to be tested is that variations in the C-terminal domain confer specific cellular functions, either by changing an ALA?s activity, regulation, localization, or substrate specificity. The second aim is to use lipidomics to quantify the abundance of specific lipids and determine whether a temperature-sensitive ala3 mutant has a defect in lipid remodeling during hot and cold temperature stresses. The third aim will determine whether the expression of a hyperactive ALA can improve vegetative growth or reproductive fitness under heat-stress conditions. The practical focus is to use recently gained knowledge on the C-terminal regulatory domains of ALAs to develop a novel strategy for improving thermotolerance in crop plants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently the majority of studies in fair machine learning are based on static settings where the machine model makes the decision only once for each individual after its deployment. However, in practical situations, the machine learning model will usually be deployed to make sequential decisions over a period of time. In such sequential decision-making settings, ensuring fairness for each single step does not guarantee fairness in the long-term, presenting a challenging and urgent problem to the fair machine learning community about achieving long-term fairness. This project will make a transformative change to fair machine learning by greatly advancing the understanding of fundamental issues of fairness in dynamic settings, shedding light on the path to addressing conflicts between inconsistent fairness concepts, and contributing to the limited base of knowledge in long-term fair machine learning which is imperative for many real-world applications. The education program will involve undergraduates, graduates and high school students to enhance their knowledge and skills in solving problems in machine learning and artificial intelligence, and attract students especially those from underrepresented groups to pursue careers in STEM.<br/><br/>This project will set up the foundation for long-term fair machine learning by leveraging Pearl's Structural Causal Model. The investigator will focus on the sequential decision-making setting where decisions made in the past may have an impact on future data. Soft intervention will be utilized to capture the causal effect of the deployment of decision models. The investigator will develop universal formulations for the long-term fairness based on the causal model so that it can be measured by causal inference techniques. Then, depending on whether the decision maker has access to adequate historical data, the investigator will study both offline and online learning settings via three progressive research tasks: (1) to study strategies and algorithms for achieving long-term fairness given sufficient historical training data; (2) to study how to not only capture the dynamics in the history but also predict the data in the future so that the decision model built would be fair in the predictable future; and (3) to move on to online learning where the decision maker has few or no training data but could update the decision model in an online manner and wants to achieve fairness eventually. Finally, two realistic extensions including unidentifiable situations and semi-Markovian models will be studied.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Salish Kootenai College and Blackfeet Community College are both Tribal Colleges. Over its six-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 105 unique full-time STEM students who are pursuing associate and/or bachelor degrees in Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics, Physical Sciences, Engineering, Computer and Information Sciences, and/or Natural Resources and Conservation. First-year students in Bachelor degree programs will receive four-year scholarships while transfer students and first-year students in Associate degree programs will receive two-year scholarships. Students in the project will have access to a wide variety of supports such as individual mentoring from STEM faculty members and peers and monthly professional development opportunities with students from all four institutions. One of the unique features of the program is the collaboration between four institutions. This increased partnership between public research institutions and Tribal Colleges will facilitate a bidirectional sharing of best practices for mentoring, inclusive instruction, and student support. The partnership will also provide students with access to peers and faculty members at three other institutions within the state.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The aims of this project are to increase the first-year retention and graduation rates for each student cohort, improve transition after graduation to either a STEM career or further higher education, and advance knowledge about issues and factors impacting advancement along the academic pathway. Montana faces post-secondary persistence challenges with two of its largest population groups: Native Americans and individuals from extremely rural areas. Each group faces unique persistence challenges, with some commonalities (e.g., strong ties to family/land, culture shock, stereotypes). Students with positive STEM-based identities perform better academically and are more likely to persist to earn a degree and stay in a STEM field. However, STEM-based identities can clash with personal identities, especially for students from marginalized communities. This project will add understanding in how to develop integrated identities that incorporate STEM identities and personal/cultural identities. To address the question of integrated identities, the social science research team will use a mixed-methods design. Findings will be synthesized into culturally-attuned, place-based knowledge that is useful for teaching, mentorship, and policy in STEM programs at Tribal and non-Tribal Colleges and Universities. This project will disseminate research findings, successes, and lessons learned to appropriate stakeholders via local and community meetings, presentations at regional and national events, and publications in relevant journals. These dissemination activities will take place on each campus and within communities as appropriate (e.g. Tribal Council meetings, community forums, and contribution to newsletters, websites, and other venues). This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Environmental factors such as extreme heat and cold snaps, flooding, the northward migration of tropical insect-borne diseases, the increasing occurrence of harmful algal blooms, and environmental degradation due to release and/or burial of anthropogenically-generated pollutants originating from waste, manufacturing, and mining are having significant and serious impacts on the health of our nation's population as well as on people around the world. To identify possible solutions, the American Geophysical Union (AGU), a professional society of over 60,000 Earth; ocean; and atmospheric scientists, students, and private sector representatives, will survey its constituents and collect input on where the geosciences are best positioned to make fast progress in ameliorating environmental impacts on human health. To accomplish this task, AGU will convene and gather information from diverse subject matter experts including scientists, practitioners, environmental justice leaders, industry leaders, entrepreneurs, education experts, and other stakeholders, including early career scientists on this broad topic. A steering committee made up that includes the AGU GeoHealth leadership will help guide this work. The activities will lead to a set of recommendations and prospects that will collectively: (1) identify high-priority challenges in GeoHealth that can be addressed in the near term (2-4 years); (2) provide a road-map or path for developing programs around these challenges; (3) provide a set of ideas to communicate the importance of GeoHealth internationally; and (4) address the need for training and career paths in GeoHealth. Results of their community survey will be summarized in a report that will be made available to the public. Key outcomes will be the identification of geoscience-related environmental processes that have the highest human-health impacts and are primed for immediate resolution and/or intervention. Broader Impacts of the activity will be to improve our understanding of and better management of environmental impacts on human health.<br/><br/>The American Geophysical Union (AGU) will conduct a broad, inclusive, results-driven survey of its constituents, which include scientists and students from across the Earth, ocean, and atmospheric sciences. Members from the private sector are also involved. The goal of the information collection exercise is to gather ideas and research areas where geoscientists, communities, and medical professionals can come together to accelerate our nation's ability to mitigate and minimize human health impacts of changes in the environment due to climate and anthropogenic activities. AGU will build off and leverage key resources, leadership, partners, and programs they have already developed in the area of GeoHealth. It will include discussions with participants selected from the AGU College of Fellows New Frontiers Committee, a committee that has already focused on supporting GeoHealth over the past year. It will also include discussions with AGU section leadership, especially in the following sections of GeoHealth, Atmospheric Sciences, Biogeosciences, Cryosphere Sciences, Ocean Science, Global Environmental Change, Hydrology, Education, Earth and Space Informatics, Earth and Planetary Surface Processes, and Science and Society. These sections all include active student and early career members. AGU leaders will also be involved from the AGU Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion Effort and its Advisory Committee; from The Thriving Earth Exchange and selected fellows and community members; as well as members of its Community Science Group which includes several relevant partners including the American Public Health Association.  Results of this effort will be summarized in a report and posted on the professional society website. An important component of the final report will be the identification of targets that can be addressed in a significant way within a 2 to 3-year timeframe. Information gathering will include online survey vehicles, virtual gatherings, one-on-one discussions with experts, and broad outreach across all fields of geoscience. An important aspect of the survey effort will be engagement of early career scientists and members of groups traditionally underrepresented in the sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This effort is driven by the desires to better understand human cognition, and to build better language technologies. This project draws on the theories and methods of both linguistics and computer science to study the learning of word stress, the pattern of relative prominence of the syllables in a word. The stress systems of the world's languages are relatively well described, and there are competing linguistic theories of how they are represented. This project applies learning methods from computer science to find new evidence to distinguish the competing linguistic theories. It also examines systems of language representation that have been developed in computer science and have received relatively little attention by linguists (neural networks). The research will engage undergraduate and graduate linguistics students at a public university. Linguistics has a much higher proportion of female students than computer science, and this project aims to address gender imbalance in STEM.  <br/><br/>From a linguistic perspective, learning stress involves learning hidden structure, parts of the representation that are not present in the observed data and that must be inferred by the learner. A given pattern of prominence over syllables is often consistent with multiple prosodic representations. The approach to hidden structure learning used in this project applies the general technique of Expectation Maximization, which in pilot work achieved good results on a standard test set. Intriguingly, many of the languages that this learner failed on in the test set are ones that are in fact cross-linguistically unattested. This project expands the set of tested languages to include more of the range of systems found cross-linguistically, and further explores the possibility that typological gaps have learning explanations. It compares hypotheses about the constraints responsible for stress placement by comparing how well they support the learning of attested systems, and whether they can help explain typological gaps. Pilot work also found indications that a neural network could learn generalizable representations of the data; the project is further testing this method. All of the software developed in this project is being made freely available, as is a database of the stress systems of the world?s languages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While much research has been dedicated to understanding how changing ocean conditions can influence shellfish development, far less has explored the potential impacts from increasing populations of large, shell-crushing predators (i.e., rays, turtles, etc.) that are experiencing poleward expansions of their ranges. This knowledge gap is likely due to the challenges of working with these mobile species, which require novel technology to track their dynamic distribution and thus foraging effects on shellfish communities. This project will build fundamental knowledge on marine habitats susceptible to predation from large mobile predators in order to ensure a sustainable future for shellfish species. Further, the work will provide guidance to costly shellfish restoration programs that are otherwise ?flying blind? with respect to predation risk. The project will have local, regional, and global educational dimensions. Firstly, this project will strengthen FAU?s graduate programs by supporting a graduate student and providing a platform for the PI to develop a new graduate course, which will be offered and evaluated twice throughout the award period. Additionally, numerous undergraduate summer interns and middle-high school students will be recruited to interact with the PI via immersive, hands-on field excursions. Lastly, the fascination of the general public and students with these charismatic animals and the project?s tangible technological components will facilitate developing an interactive ?Audio Waves? exhibit at a local outreach center, which will be evaluated several times during the project and slated for permanent display. <br/><br/>Our scientific understanding of the ecological role of large mobile durophages (i.e., shell-crushing predators) is limited due to challenges presented by the elusive nature of these species. These shortcomings hinder our scientific understanding of their role in benthic community dynamics. Filling such knowledge gaps requires novel approaches that can detect and classify predator-prey interactions in situ. Using multiple large predator models (rays, sea turtles, fish, and crabs), the project will: 1) capture and characterize predator feeding (shell-crushing) sounds and shell fragmentation patterns, 2) understand in situ detection constraints of the predation signal within the context of natural underwater noise using simulations, and 3) quantify the distribution of predator foraging impacts across two model seascapes in Bermuda and Florida via integration of habitat- and individual-based (animal tags) passive acoustics. Detection and classification (by both predator and prey) will be completed using novel application of machine-learning techniques, which will be used to automate predation event extraction from extensive data archives. Recording equipment will be strategically distributed across seascapes to permit a multi-scale understanding of durophagy and testing of theoretical models of predation (e.g., optimal/central place foraging). Long-term monitoring will also provide an opportunity to assess the role of environmental/oceanographic variables in driving these interactions. Consequently, this work will fill a large knowledge gap in the dynamics of marine food webs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project addresses a series of unanswered mathematical and algorithmic challenges at the heart of sketching distance-based properties of graphs, such as shortest paths or reachability.  Three primary goals are: (i) to determine the efficacy of graph spanners, which are sketches of shortest path distances and which have enjoyed successful applications in areas like robotics, distributed computing, and circuit design; (ii) to classify the sketching problems for which more involved constructions of data structures can or cannot outperform simpler sketching methods like taking subgraphs; and (iii) to find the most relevant structural parameters of graphs, like expansion, highway dimension, etc. that control the difficulty of building a sketch of that graph.

This project will produce sheet, foil and wire formats in a single step, with novel mechanical property combinations of higher strength and formability not achievable by current sheet rolling processes. The property combinations are expected to enable improved structural performance and lightweight materials for the aerospace, automotive, and energy sectors. The machining-based processing will provide a sustainable manufacturing system for sheet, foil and wire from a range of commercial lightweight alloys such as titanium, aluminum and magnesium. Importantly, the new process requires lower energy (> 50% reduction) and compact infrastructure compared to current rolling facilities. The Partnership will also contribute to broadening the participation of underrepresented groups in innovation, and positively impact engineering education.<br/><br/>The proposed project will provide a new energy-efficient process alternative to current multistage rolling processes characterized by large energy usage and emissions, and high cost. To realize this goal, the project will address three objectives. First, hybrid-machining process parameters will be optimized by systematic study of how deformation plasticity conditions influence sheet-metal structure and properties. Second, process attributes will be characterized in terms of product quality (surface finish, properties), process energy, and production rate and cost. Last, by integrating the results, a systems framework will be defined in a pre-commercial production process for titanium and titanium alloy foil/sheet formats. The manufacturing benefits will be quantified in terms of process energy savings, material property enhancements, production cost, and applicability to varied material systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In co-created, place-based learning experiences for Native youth, interweaving cultural traditions, arts, language, and community partnerships is vital for authentic, meaningful learning. Standardized STEM curricula and Western-based pedagogies within the mainstream and formal education systems do not reflect the nature of Native STEM knowledge, nor do they make deep connections to it. The absence of this knowledge base can reinforce a deficit-based STEM identity, which can directly impact Native youths? participation and engagement in STEM. Reframing STEM education for Native youth to prioritize the vitality of community and sustainability requires active consideration of what counts as science learning and who serves as holders and conduits of STEM knowledge. As highly regarded holders of traditional and western STEM knowledge, Native educators and cultural practitioners are critical for facilitating Native youths? curiosity and engagement with STEM. This Innovations in Development project is Native-led and centers Native knowledge, voice, and contributions in STEM through a culturally based, dual-learning approach that emphasizes traditional and western STEM knowledge. Through this lens, a network of over a dozen tribal nations across 20 U.S. states will be established to support and facilitate the learning of Traditional and Western STEM knowledge in a culturally sustaining manner. The network will build on existing programs and develop a set of unique, interconnected, and synchronized placed-based informal STEM programs for Native youth reflecting the distinctive cultural aspects of Native American and Alaska Native Tribes. The network will also involve a Natives-In-STEM Role Models innovation, in which Native STEM professionals will provide inspiration to Native youth through conversations about their journeys in STEM within cultural contexts. In addition, the network will cultivate a professional network of STEM educators, practitioners, and tribal leaders. Network efforts and the formative evaluation will culminate in the development and dissemination of a community-based, co-created Framework for Informal STEM Education with Native Communities.<br/><br/>Together with Elders and other contributors of each community, local leads within the STEM for Youth in Native Communities (SYNC) Network team will identify and guide the STEM content topics, as well as co-create and implement the program within their sovereign lands with their youth. The content, practitioners, and programming in each community will be distinct, but the community-based, dual learning contextual framework will be consistent. Each community includes several partner organizations poised to contribute to the programming efforts, including tribal government departments, tribal and public K-12 schools, tribal colleges, museums and cultural centers, non-profits, local non-tribal government support agencies, colleges and universities, and various grassroots organizations. Programmatic designs will vary and may include field excursions, summer and after school STEM experiences, and workshops. In addition, the Natives-In-STEM innovation will be implemented across the programs, providing youth with access to Native STEM professionals and career pathways across the country. To understand the impacts of SYNC?s efforts, an external evaluator will explore a broad range of questions through formative and summative evaluations. The evaluation questions seek to explore: (a) the extent to which the culturally based, dual learning methods implemented in SYNC informal STEM programs affect Native youths? self-efficacy in STEM and (b) how the components of SYNC?s overall theoretical context and network (e.g., partnerships, community contributors such as Elders, STEM practitioners and professionals) impact community attitudes and behaviors regarding youth STEM learning. Data and knowledge gained from these programs will inform the primary deliverable, a Framework for Native Informal STEM Education, which aims to support the informal STEM education community as it expands and deepens its service to Native youth and communities. Future enhanced professional development opportunities for teachers and educators to learn more about the findings and practices highlighted in the Framework are envisioned to maximize its strategic impact. <br/><br/>This Innovations and Development Project is a five year endeavor and supported by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments, multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. The project is also co-funded by NSF Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES), a comprehensive national initiative to enhance U.S. leadership in discoveries and innovations by focusing on diversity, inclusion and broadening participation in STEM at scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite modern agricultural practices and chemistry improvements, almost 40% of all crop production is lost due to pests and pathogens each year; within the U.S. over 25% of soybean production is lost this way. These losses are even more severe in regions where pesticide application is prohibitively expensive for farmers.  This project develops a new technology for use in soybean and other oilseed crops to protect against plant disease.<br/><br/>The proposed project will develop a broad-spectrum pathogen resistance trait.  While the first generation of transgenic trait technologies conferring herbicide tolerance and insecticidal traits have been readily established for oilseed production across North and South America, further development has faltered due to the complexity of these plant traits. Unfortunately, the proteins that provide the best tolerance to adverse environmental conditions also result in toxic side-effects when produced in healthy plants; consequently, the utility of developing these proteins is limited. Current methods for regulating expression of resistance proteins introduced into plants through genetic engineering are insufficient to regulate toxic proteins/compounds that may have side-effects in other environmental conditions. The proposed project will demonstrate an expression system that responds to signals, common to both bacterial and fungal pathogens, in the early and late stages of the plant immune response to release the production of anti-microbial proteins only in when needed, effectively eliminating the off-target side-effects. The project objectives are to 1) perform field and greenhouse trial of soybean with this technology to ascertain extent of pathogen resistance and yield effects in infected and healthy conditions; 2) optimize the technology for tissue specific (i.e., roots vs. leaves) use in soybean; 3) conduct greenhouse experiments to determine response to pathogen detection in canola, cotton, and potato as candidates for future field trials and commercialization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given this, and the complexity of the higher education market, it comes as little surprise that U.S. colleges?mostly for-profit schools?have spent as much as $1.65 billion annually on advertisements in recent years. Despite the proliferation of college ads, little is known about how advertising impacts enrollment choices, and whether it remedies gaps in awareness and information, which may improve individuals? postsecondary choices and degree attainment, or exploits the gaps using misleading or deceptive content, which may lead to costly enrollment mistakes and widen socioeconomic gaps in college completion. This project will investigate how college TV advertising affects enrollment at less-selective postsecondary institutions. The researchers will use several large datasets and state-of-the-art methods to estimate the effects of college advertising on individuals? enrollment choices, degree completion, and earnings. The questions studied and knowledge generated in this project are relevant to issues of college access and equity, as groups historically excluded from U.S. higher education are more likely to be targeted and influenced by college advertisements. The findings from this research will provide empirical evidence to inform policy conversations about college advertising, pricing, and accountability.<br/><br/>This project studies how college advertising impacts individuals? tertiary enrollment decisions, degree completion, and post-college earnings. The first part of the project will examine how TV advertising affects demand for college. The PIs will estimate causal impacts of colleges? own advertising, and that of competitors, on new undergraduate enrollments, and will analyze the patterns of advertising-induced enrollment substitution across different types of colleges. To identify the impacts of advertising on demand, the PIs will use a novel strategy that exploits exogenous variation in the realized impressions, or views, of TV ads. The PIs will implement the research design using a new dataset on college advertising, created by linking ad-level data to annual institution-level data on U.S. colleges. The second part of the project will study how college advertising impacts students? educational and labor market outcomes. The PIs will combine advertising data with a longitudinal administrative database from one large state containing education and wage data of high school graduates. A border strategy will be used to identify and estimate the impact of advertising on college persistence, degree completion, and wages. Results from the first part of the project will show the extent to which colleges? own TV advertising generates new enrollments and whether competitors? ads reduce enrollments or generate positive enrollment spillovers. The results from the second part will reveal if individuals? educational and earnings outcomes are improved or worsened by college ads, which will provide suggestive evidence of whether college advertising is informative, deceptive, or both.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent studies have shown that the number of genes associated with skin pigmentation differs across populations and that much of this genetic variation is still unidentified due to underrepresentation of some populations in human genetic research. This doctoral dissertation project lays the groundwork necessary to model human skin pigmentation evolution by characterizing and functionally validating the genetic architecture of skin pigmentation in a population that has been underrepresented in such research. Data generated from this project can inform several pigmentation research objectives, including understanding the role of natural selection in shaping this human trait. The project can also be used as a model for research on other complex genetic traits and may inform other fields including bioarchaeology and forensic anthropology. Additionally, this project contributes to the skill development of undergraduate and graduate students through wet lab, computational, and fieldwork training.<br/><br/>The research team conducts fieldwork to collect paired genetic and pigmentation data from individuals in a population with high levels of ancestral alleles and higher levels of genetic diversity than other extant human populations. The research presents an opportunity to research pigmentation variation that may have been present in ancestral human populations, and therefore potentially broadens our understanding of pigmentation genetics globally. Newly collected samples will be genotyped and then evaluated using a genome-wide association (GWA) approach. Data from four different descent populations will be meta-analyzed to increase power to detect low-effect size loci. Regions identified in the GWA study are not necessarily causal pigmentation loci, rendering functional validation necessary. Top candidate genes are therefore identified and functionally evaluated for causality with CRISPR (clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats) gene editing in zebrafish, an effective model organism to study human skin pigmentation. Using a rapid automated phenotyping platform to image larvae, pigmentation is analyzed comparing CRISPR- mosaic ?knockout? fish with ?mock? injected sibling controls. This strategy can functionally verify whether novel associated genes from the GWAS are causal pigmentation genes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Core drilling consumes about 10,000 gallons of water per day, often in water-deficient areas. The proposed new approach negates the need for water in the drilling process, thereby mitigating the risk of pollution to public and wildlife drinking water sources. Reducing the time required for a typical drilling project from weeks to days reduces the carbon emission from the energy-intensive drilling equipment required. This solution to problems associated with acquiring subsurface data with traditional techniques has an addressable market segment value of $21 billion.

For example, pollination mutualisms are essential for fruit production in many crop plants, and pollinators are dependent on the food they obtain from those flowers. Mutualisms, in general, usually involve many species interacting with one another in complex communities, yet we know relatively little about the factors that govern them. Thus, as global change continues to alter ecosystems on Earth, there is a strong need to understand how species that form mutualisms change in response to the environment and to one another. For instance, the presence of competitive species that use the resources made by mutualists could alter the way in which the mutualists change in response to one another. This research will examine how large groups of mutualist species change in response to each other across different environments and how other competitive species can influence these changes. The project uses an experimental system based on brewer?s yeast to understand how species change in response to one another in complex mutualisms involving many species. In addition to testing how mutualisms change in species rich communities, an engaging video game will be developed to teach high school students about the economic value of mutualisms and how they change over time.<br/><br/>The project will use a laboratory-based nutritional mutualism composed of strains of budding yeast that exchange nutrient resources with each other, thus simulating mutualistic species. Using this system, the researchers will manipulate the number of mutualist species in the communities and the amount of environmentally-available resources to address the following goals: 1) Evaluate how reciprocal trait changes (i.e., coevolution) vary in complex mutualist communities with and without traded resources additionally available from the local environment, 2) Test how coevolution influences the establishment of new mutualists in species-rich mutualist communities, 3) Test how a competitive species alters the coevolution of mutualists and how coevolution impacts mutualism resistance to these competitors. Results from the proposed study will identify the ecological contexts that affect coevolution in mutualisms, the evolutionary contexts that allows establishment of nonresident species, and how coevolution impacts ecological persistence of mutualists and competitive species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Salish Kootenai College and Blackfeet Community College are both Tribal Colleges. Over its six-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 105 unique full-time STEM students who are pursuing associate and/or bachelor degrees in Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics, Physical Sciences, Engineering, Computer and Information Sciences, and/or Natural Resources and Conservation. First-year students in Bachelor degree programs will receive four-year scholarships while transfer students and first-year students in Associate degree programs will receive two-year scholarships. Students in the project will have access to a wide variety of supports such as individual mentoring from STEM faculty members and peers and monthly professional development opportunities with students from all four institutions. One of the unique features of the program is the collaboration between four institutions. This increased partnership between public research institutions and Tribal Colleges will facilitate a bidirectional sharing of best practices for mentoring, inclusive instruction, and student support. The partnership will also provide students with access to peers and faculty members at three other institutions within the state.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The aims of this project are to increase the first-year retention and graduation rates for each student cohort, improve transition after graduation to either a STEM career or further higher education, and advance knowledge about issues and factors impacting advancement along the academic pathway. Montana faces post-secondary persistence challenges with two of its largest population groups: Native Americans and individuals from extremely rural areas. Each group faces unique persistence challenges, with some commonalities (e.g., strong ties to family/land, culture shock, stereotypes). Students with positive STEM-based identities perform better academically and are more likely to persist to earn a degree and stay in a STEM field. However, STEM-based identities can clash with personal identities, especially for students from marginalized communities. This project will add understanding in how to develop integrated identities that incorporate STEM identities and personal/cultural identities. To address the question of integrated identities, the social science research team will use a mixed-methods design. Findings will be synthesized into culturally-attuned, place-based knowledge that is useful for teaching, mentorship, and policy in STEM programs at Tribal and non-Tribal Colleges and Universities. This project will disseminate research findings, successes, and lessons learned to appropriate stakeholders via local and community meetings, presentations at regional and national events, and publications in relevant journals. These dissemination activities will take place on each campus and within communities as appropriate (e.g. Tribal Council meetings, community forums, and contribution to newsletters, websites, and other venues). This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the recent COVID-19 outbreak has highlighted, autonomous robots can solve a range of time-sensitive problems including logistics, reconnaissance, and disinfection of critical areas. Beyond pandemic, small-scale robots can help humans in complex or dangerous tasks such as search and rescue, security, and surveillance, and, thanks to their lighter weight, they pose only a modest risk to human safety. These time-sensitive tasks require robots to make fast decisions and agile maneuvers in complex and dynamic environments. State-of-the-art autonomous navigation approaches, while mature, are slow and brittle and prevent robust and resilient agile navigation. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) Program studies the fundamental perception-action problem for agile navigation of autonomous robots in complex environments by planning a novel, low-latency, robust, adaptive, safe, and resilient paradigm. This project aims also to educate students on the technical aspects, societal benefits, and ethical use of autonomous systems by establishing a unique multi-disciplinary, and integrated research and educational platform which includes a core curriculum on robot localization and navigation, and a series of online racing hackathons for a post-pandemic customized and integrated research and educational experience. These will contribute to lowering the barrier to participation in research and education for students.<br/><br/>This project will generate a new foundational theory, which includes models and algorithms resulting from a principled combination of perception, learning, and control to holistically design visual perception and action to create small-scale agile autonomous robots. The goal is to capture the strict cross?coupling effects between perception and action to jointly and concurrently resolve the perception-action problem to speed up the robots? decision making process and increase their agility. The project is organized in three thrusts according to a series of objectives, culminating in innovations in robotics autonomy research and education. A compressed and unified representation of the perception and action spaces guarantees to reduce the robot's inference latency and naturally reveals the cross-coupling effects among them. Next, the robot will exploit using this representation its action-predictive information to enhance its inference capabilities and will employ an optimal control/planning approach to maximize its perception accuracy and quality.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Antibiotic resistance in crops is increasing. One of the most promising alternatives to antibiotics is bacteriophages, also known as phages. Phages are safe bacterial viruses already used on a small commercial scale in the United States. One major bottleneck for phage use in a larger number of diseases is the difficulty involved in selecting phages that will be effective against the target pathogen. This project addresses this challenge by aiming to develop a state-of-the-art computational approach to select phages against a range of diseases in a rapid and efficient manner. This technology will allow for widespread phage use as a safer and more efficient substitution for antibiotics. Additionally, the final deliverable of this project includes developing the first-ever phage-based, sustainable, and cost-effective antimicrobial solution against Huanglongbing, a devastating and completely incurable bacterial disease of citruses.<br/><br/>The proposed project aims to remove a key bottleneck in the bacteriophage field by building the first-ever commercially viable platform technology to computationally predict phage-host interactions. Specifically, it is currently difficult and time-consuming to select bacteriophages against target pathogens as this manual process is inefficient.  Moreover, phages cannot be isolated against uncultivable bacteria. The proposed project aims to use cutting-edge Natural Language Processing for bacteriophage use against an increasing number of pathogens. This proposal?s first objective is to significantly improve the already built models and show that their predictions hold in vitro using the gold-standard plaque assay experiments. This proposal?s second objective is to use this platform technology and wet-lab methods to produce and test the first-ever antibacterial (phage-based) solution that works against the currently incurable Huanglongbing disease caused by an uncultivable pathogen. This project will further help determine if Transformer-based models can excel at complex genome understanding tasks and produce in-vitro-viable viral-host interaction predictions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Surveys are one of the best ways for researchers to learn about the behaviors and attitudes of a population. Due to the popularity of smartphones, researchers have the option of conducting real time repeated surveys on participants' smartphones. However, participants may choose not to respond to the surveys or may respond without fully paying attention. Currently, there is a lack of data and guidance on how to detect and manage the latter problem of inattentive responding in surveys. Inattentive response to surveys may result in poor data quality and affect the accuracy of research conclusions. This research will examine inattentive responding in longitudinal and repeated surveys. The project will establish models of when and why inattentive responding is likely to occur and provide insights into preventive strategies to increase the validity of self-report measures. The project also will generate recommendations for detecting poor data quality and suggest preventative measures. Data and techniques resulting from this project will be made publicly available. Improved research methodology and more accurate research conclusions will benefit policy formation and evidence-based decision making, as well as society through scientific journalism, education, and research.<br/><br/>This research project will translate inattentive response detection elements from online survey research to an intensive ecological monetary assessment (EMA) study to develop novel and practical strategies that could be recommended for future intensive longitudinal studies. Due to advancements in mobile technology, there is increased promise of using smartphones to access individuals in their natural environment. EMA is a real-time sampling strategy that researchers can use to collect repeated measures of self-report data such as current experiences, behaviors, and moods, resulting in more ecologically valid data. However, sustaining participant engagement can be challenging given the potential burden from completing repeated surveys, and there is a lack of research and guidance on how to manage decreased data quality due to burden. This project will 1) test the accuracy or indices to detect which surveys may be invalid, 2) use a mixed methods approach to determine what factors increase the probability of engaging in inattentive responding, and 3) model how including these invalid surveys in data analysis creates deviations in results. As a result of these analyses, guidelines will be developed for conducting longitudinal studies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The meeting continues the tradition of biennial international conferences through the Society for Mathematics and Computation in Music held on alternating sides of the Atlantic. The conference brings together researchers from around the world who combine mathematics or computation with music theory, music analysis, composition, and performance. MCM provides a unique platform for the communication and exchange of ideas among researchers in these areas. Conference participants who are researchers in mathematics and computation will carry out interactive sessions for the public at the Museum of Design Atlanta. The conference also includes public concerts every evening, some of them with comments, explanations, and visual accompaniment, which will exemplify and enhance the scientific program.<br/><br/>Questions about variation, similarity, enumeration, and classification of musical structures have long intrigued both musicians and mathematicians. Mathematical models can be found for almost all levels of musical activities, from composition to sound production by traditional instruments or by digital means. On the other hand, mathematicians have found stimulating relations within applications of mathematics to established musical relations, which have led to interesting open questions in mathematics and to techniques for solving existing ones. For example, structures such as maximally even sets, developed in the context of mathematical music theory, have found applications in the Ising model in physics, and musical tiling canons have contributed to advances in the Fuglede conjecture for small dimensions. The use of artificial intelligence and machine learning to achieve, for instance, human-like jazz improvisation shows the close relation between mathematical music theory and the cognitive sciences. The articles that result from the MCM conference will be published in the Lecture Notes in Artificial Intelligence (LNAI) series. The articles have undergone a strict peer review process and will be presented either as talks (12-page articles) or posters (6-page articles). There will also be plenary talks and panel sessions specifically designed to formalize and integrate the relatively young field of modern mathematical music theory. The research highlighted at the meeting brings innovations not only in the mathematical and computational sciences, with new theorems and applications of abstract theories, the creation of computational models and software, etc., but also makes an impact on different areas within music, such as performance, musicology, music teaching, and music cognition. <br/><br/>More information about the conference can be found at: http://mcm2022.org/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over its six year duration, this project will fund scholarships up to 43 community college students who are pursuing associate?s degrees in Biology, Chemistry, Environmental Science, or Physical Sciences. Full-time STEM students will receive up to 6 semesters of scholarships and part-time students (enrolled for at least 6 semester units) will receive up to 8 semesters of scholarships based on financial need. FRC is a small community college in rural and remote north-eastern California. The project aims to increase the parity of rural STEM students with their urban peers, as they enter and graduate from FRC?s Associate of Science programs in order to transfer vertically in STEM or to join governmental organizations or industry in a STEM capacity. Importantly, rural community colleges are the fastest growing sector of U.S. community colleges and thus represent one of the greatest future opportunities to impact STEM workforce development. This project, structured by the Guided Pathways Model, aims to leverage technology in order to build a STEM identity that reaches outside the county without the need to travel, and to more fully support students as they enter the rural STEM pipeline. As a small, rural and geographically remote community college, this project has significant potential to become a model to advance understanding of how to effectively and efficiently support rural STEM students as they navigate the rural STEM pipeline.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The scope of this project aims to increase student persistence in STEM fields by linking scholarships with the following three objectives and interventions: (1) Recruit, retain and support FRC STEM Students with an institutional STEM Task Force. (2) Boost STEM identity and ongoing participation in STEM with an online STEM success and enrichment course that will bring STEM scientists and their science to FRC in an effective and efficient way. Both these objectives will be supported by STEM online active learning office Hours that will (3) allow students to increase student engagement and learning in a time-flexible setting. An important goal of this project, supported by an embedded educational researcher, is to increase understanding about the barriers rural STEM students face and how to mitigate such barriers to increase retention in the rural STEM pipeline and thus positively impact STEM workforce development. In addition, a robust, iterative project evaluation approach will ensure that project objectives are met and modified as needed to address the barrier that affect the success and retention of rural STEM students. The implementation and outcomes of this project should be of interest to a variety of post-secondary education stakeholders interested in rural communities and STEM workforce development. Dissemination will target a wide audience including, but not limited to, education researchers, policymakers, and transfer institutions, in order to maximize the visibility of this project. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sometimes this can even be something that we are actively looking for, like typos in our writing. These ?looked but failed to see? (LBFTS) errors can be potentially dangerous, as when a radiologist fails to see signs of cancer in a lung x-ray or a driver fails to see someone crossing the road. The aim of this project is to understand the source of these  LBFTS errors and to investigate possible ways to reduce them.<br/><br/>There are a variety of different causes that might lead someone to fail to report something that is clearly visible when pointed out. For example, some LBFTS errors can be thought of as a version of bad luck: You can't process everything, so only some  stimuli get processed adequately. The experiments in Aim 1 investigate whether LBFTS errors in some tasks are random or whether there are attributes of the missed stimuli that make them less likely to be found. A second possibility, explored in Aim 2, is that there are perceptual biases within the functional visual field or useful field of view, defined as the region around the point where you are looking, within which you could find your target (even if you don?t). For example, if you are reading English, while you are looking at one word, you are biased to the next words to the right rather than to the words directly above or below where you are fixating. When reading Arabic or Hebrew, you would be biased to words on the left of your fixation point. The two principal investigators on this project have different ideas about where the biases in the functional visual field  might come from and they exploit an ""adversarial collaboration"" in order to resolve these differences. Finally, Aim 3 is devoted to LBFTS errors that occur when doing one task but still ""keeping an eye out"" for other stimuli (e.g. when a doctor is examining a chest x-ray, it may show more than just the fractured rib about which the patient is complaining, such as a suspicious sign of cancer). The investigators will try to develop ways to help observers do their primary task while staying attuned to the possible occurrence of important but non-related events. If the sources of LBFTS errors can be identified and reduced, it could have a major impact on important societal arenas, such as medical image perception and traffic accidents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The technology seeks to develop and evaluate a simple, low-cost, sterilization receptacle for the effective, automated decontamination of FFRs. The aim is to enable first responders and healthcare workers to sterilize FFRs and prepare them at the point of care for re-use within minutes.  This capability can be useful both in the current and potential future pandemics.<br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project seeks to harness high voltage pulsed electric fields (PEFs) for decontamination and re-use of FFRs. In addition to killing bacteria and fungi, PEF has been observed to rapidly inactivate enteric viruses within seconds of exposure. PEF can also be used to electrically recharge FFR mask fibers prior to re-use.  The filtration efficiency of N-95 FFRs is improved by an intermediate layer of charged polypropylene electret fibers that trap small particles through electrostatic or electrophoretic effects.  A prototype will be constructed and evaluated on FFRs inoculated with respiratory viruses, including SARS-CoV2, in a clinical virology lab to directly demonstrate sterilization and recharge efficacy. The project will establish whether such a system will allow multiple sterilizations and fiber recharging cycles without affecting FFR function or efficacy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of this heat is lost to the atmosphere as cold winds blow over the ocean. This heat loss causes local changes in the solubility of carbon dioxide in seawater and increases mixing of the upper ocean. Both of these impacts affect the ocean?s ability to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Knowledge of the ocean?s carbon uptake in this region is important for our ability to understand and predict the global carbon cycle that determines atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Conditions in the Gulf Stream region change rapidly and are hard to sample, however. In this project, investigators will deploy a robotic glider for several weeks to measure temperature and salinity in the upper 1000 meters of the Gulf Stream region. The glider will overlap with other robotic vehicles called Saildrones that take measurements of surface waters and the atmosphere. Together these vehicles will produce a picture of ocean conditions and carbon uptake that is not possible with short-term sampling from ships. This project will support an early career scientist, a postdoctoral scholar, and a graduate student.<br/><br/>In this project, the Principal Investigators (PIs) will deploy one autonomous glider during the late spring-early summer of 2022 that will measure subsurface ocean properties in upper 1000 m of the Gulf Stream region. This glider will target the waters around three Saildrones that are deployed in this area through an independent project funded by Google.org.  Uncrewed surface vehicles such as Saildrone autonomously measure surface oceanic and atmospheric variables at high temporal resolution but generally lack subsurface observations.  The water column data from the glider and the surface data from the Saildrones will allow the PIs to test the effectiveness of the synergy of the glider-Saildrone combination as a method to holistically characterize the ocean variability on the scale of tens of kilometers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has both scientific and societal benefits in addition to integrating research and education. This REU project will introduce undergraduates to research methods in health equity fields that prioritize the involvement of community members. This includes approaches where community organizations or community members themselves may guide the focus of the research. This is in contrast to other methods where the research questions and methods are only determined by the researcher. These kinds of methods help to engage community members, which is especially important for addressing health equity topics. This is because health equity topics often focus on populations who have experienced exclusion and discrimination and may distrust researchers or the institutions they represent. It also ensures that the community members have a voice in determining what areas of health are of greatest need. We will introduce students to these methods by having them work on one of several ongoing or recently completed research projects that uses these kinds of methods. Students will complete analyses on the project of their choosing and be involved in other research activities to help them learn common methods for engaging and collaborating with community members. This work will be overseen by a mentor who led the original project. Undergraduate participants will also attend workshops that introduce them to a variety of key concepts for research that engages community members. Additional workshops will focus on professional development. At the end of these experiences, undergraduate participants will present their findings to researchers at the host university. Our approach to this kind of research helps ensure that undergraduates receive training on the best available methods for doing health equity research in a way that moves toward equity in outcomes. Because of the focus of the project, we also anticipate that our participants will be more diverse than the field as a whole. We therefore are likely to help advance the careers of a more diverse workforce to better address health equity research needs.<br/><br/>The health research workforce remains far less diverse than the communities they serve. Adequate representation is vital to advancing health equity within these fields. Prioritizing health equity and utilizing community-engaged approaches that respect the populations being studied provides the best opportunity for engaging the students who share these same backgrounds. Such approaches clearly communicate that their perspectives are valued and central to successful advancing this research. This summer REU will promote interest in advanced methodological approaches for health equity and health disparities related research. Faculty teach science through sequenced, weekly didactics leading to and operating alongside hands-on research across a 10-week summer program. This REU further facilitates cohort experiences in a laboratory setting, integrating REU students with project managers, post-doctoral researchers, graduate students, and undergraduate research assistants for optimal learning and engagement. The goal of the project is to increase representation in health science careers by training participants in community-engaged methodological approaches to health equity research. Health equity is critical to overall public health and subsequently a central component of crosscutting initiatives within NSF, NIH, SAMSHA, and others. The continuation of this REU in health equity is critical for providing students diverse, applied research opportunities in health equity. It centers effective, yet underutilized methods like Community Based Participatory Research (CBPR) and culturally sensitive paradigms. This unique REU experience will continue to: 1) generate interest in health sciences, especially in health equity; 2) promote skill development for success in graduate education; 3) create a research support network to support students; 4) provide mentoring on career paths and graduate education, and 5) provide undergraduate students experience in presenting and publishing research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The hallmark of this survival is their unique ability to form a ?tun,? a survival state achieved through withdrawing of limbs, expelling internal water stores, and significantly decreasing metabolism. Tardigrades can remain in this state for years while remaining relatively undamaged, emerging only when the external threat has been removed. However, how this survival is regulated is largely unknown. The investigators' work has revealed a dependence of tardigrade survival on the presence of highly reactive oxygen-containing chemicals, small cellular messengers present in all living systems. These chemicals are essential signaling molecules that alter metabolic activity through the modification of proteins within the cell.  The multidisciplinary team of scientists from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Marshall University can track these signals and affected biological compounds within tardigrades through powerful analytical and biochemical methods. The investigator team will combine these approaches to comprehensively map the entrance and emergence of tardigrade into and from tun across unique stresses allowing them to determine the precise adaptations that enable extreme stress tolerance. This work is integral to understanding molecular strategies for extreme stress tolerance within cells that can be applied to understand stress across life on earth.  The collaborative teams will create sister courses on their campus, working across institutions to characterize different tardigrade proteins.  In addition, students will be engaged in undergraduate research and gain experience in protein chemistry, computational modeling, and scientific literacy.<br/><br/>Tardigrades (water bears) are cosmopolitan microscopic invertebrates that respond quickly to environmental stressors using ingenious modes of extremotolerance collectively known as cryptobiosis. Understanding the regulatory processes governing tardigrade cryptobiosis is essential to revealing the molecular strategies that preserve biochemical pathways when exposed to extreme stress. While cryptobiosis is prevalent across taxa, there exists only a nascent understanding of the molecular mechanisms and to what extent different types are interconnected. We are far from a comprehensive understanding of the biochemical participants, the coordination among diverse networks, or of the interplay between stress and survival. A multi-disciplinary team will combine their expertise in proteomics and reactive oxygen species monitoring with the aim of elucidating the redox-dependence of tardigrade extremotolerance. They will characterize tardigrade survival on both a physiological and proteomic level, enabling enhanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which tardigrades survive various hostile environments. Project outcomes include: a) the identification and characterization of essential redox-modified proteins required for cryptobiosis induction; b) the mapping of redox signaling across distinct cryptobioses; and c) the identification of key regulatory points in the tardigrade ?cryptobiome?. This work will generate the most comprehensive biomolecular framework for cryptobiosis, to date.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This CAREER project aims to investigate the experiences of persons excluded because of ethnicity or race (PEERs) in STEM and guide change efforts in the culture of chemistry degree programs. Scholarly literature demonstrates that programs and resources designed to support diversity, inclusion, and equity in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields have not achieved equity in outcomes for PEERs. The study builds from the theory that achieving equitable outcomes in STEM will require transformation at the systemic level, including values, assumptions, and behaviors. Understanding chemistry culture and its influence on PEERs? experiences will help to catalyze systemic transformation around diversity, equity, and inclusion in chemistry.<br/><br/>Using qualitative methods, the research will solicit PEERs? experiences with chemistry culture. Implicit values, behaviors, and assumptions that influence visible behaviors, structures, and systems in the discipline will be analyzed. Understanding these experiences will contribute to a generalized understanding of chemistry culture that can be used to inform change efforts that advance diversity, equity, and inclusion. Counterstories will also be developed to elevate individualized accounts that challenge existing systems and structures in chemistry. Education activities include the development of a STEM graduate course based on research findings. The course will support graduate students in critical examination of habitual practices that reproduce inequity, endeavoring to shift existing behaviors and build capacity for implementing culturally inclusive and contextually relevant practices. The impacts of this course will be studied over time to enhance understanding of effective, equity-focused instructional practices.

Their growth has been enabled by innovation in technologies and low-power system design. We are also seeing a rapid adoption of machine-learning (ML) techniques in healthcare applications. However, a significant technological gap exists when it comes to adopting ML techniques for wearable and implantable biomedical hardware because of the relatively high power consumption and chip area requirements associated with ML solutions. This project aims to develop ML-based hardware solutions for wearable and implantable biomedical devices. To realize power and device size goals, analog computing will be used to develop the ML hardware platform. The proposed analog computing platform will be used to develop ultra-low power ML hardware for detecting arrythmia and obstructive sleep apnea. The research outcomes from this project will be integrated into education to develop new graduate and undergraduate courses on ML and power management. Undergraduate and high-school students will participate in the research through the Young Scholar Program (YSP) and REU outreach activities. The project will provide a platform for training graduate and undergraduate students on biomedical devices, circuit and chip design, and ML hardware design. Outreach activities will involve K-12 students.<br/><br/>This project is centered around the realization of ultra-low power (ULP) machine learning (ML) system-on-chip (SoC) hardware with inference capability for wearable and implantable biomedical applications. Power consumption and device size requirements make it challenging to integrate ML solutions in mobile health devices. To realize the power consumption and device size minimization goals, robust sub-threshold analog computing circuits will be developed while overcoming variability issues previously associated with analog computing. A new analog system modeling and simulation tool will be created to associate power consumption, noise, linearity, and other performance goals of analog circuits with the classification accuracy of a given ML network to realize area, power, and performance optimized ML hardware. The analog computing hardware framework will be developed with a new constant transconductance-based sub-threshold design to realize high energy efficiency and robustness goals. The approach will also support multi-layer analog computing designs without the need for interfacing amplifiers or converters for signal conditioning. The resulting modeling and simulation tool will associate circuit design goals with ML classification accuracy. It will further help in reducing power and area to develop tailored analog circuits for ML networks with specific power and performance goals while maintaining the required classification accuracies. To exemplify the design approach, the analog system modeling tool and robust analog computing circuits will be utilized to develop an ultra-low power analog SoC to demonstrate ML applications for ECG and pulse oximetry, with the goal to show up to 50-times reduction in power consumption while maintaining a high classification accuracy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, pollination mutualisms are essential for fruit production in many crop plants, and pollinators are dependent on the food they obtain from those flowers. Mutualisms, in general, usually involve many species interacting with one another in complex communities, yet we know relatively little about the factors that govern them. Thus, as global change continues to alter ecosystems on Earth, there is a strong need to understand how species that form mutualisms change in response to the environment and to one another. For instance, the presence of competitive species that use the resources made by mutualists could alter the way in which the mutualists change in response to one another. This research will examine how large groups of mutualist species change in response to each other across different environments and how other competitive species can influence these changes. The project uses an experimental system based on brewer?s yeast to understand how species change in response to one another in complex mutualisms involving many species. In addition to testing how mutualisms change in species rich communities, an engaging video game will be developed to teach high school students about the economic value of mutualisms and how they change over time.<br/><br/>The project will use a laboratory-based nutritional mutualism composed of strains of budding yeast that exchange nutrient resources with each other, thus simulating mutualistic species. Using this system, the researchers will manipulate the number of mutualist species in the communities and the amount of environmentally-available resources to address the following goals: 1) Evaluate how reciprocal trait changes (i.e., coevolution) vary in complex mutualist communities with and without traded resources additionally available from the local environment, 2) Test how coevolution influences the establishment of new mutualists in species-rich mutualist communities, 3) Test how a competitive species alters the coevolution of mutualists and how coevolution impacts mutualism resistance to these competitors. Results from the proposed study will identify the ecological contexts that affect coevolution in mutualisms, the evolutionary contexts that allows establishment of nonresident species, and how coevolution impacts ecological persistence of mutualists and competitive species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For the first time, many instructors were faced with the dilemma of how to administer exams, quizzes effectively, and other in-class assignments in an online setting in which live, in-person proctoring was not available. Online proctoring quickly became an attractive option to monitor students remotely while completing an assignment. In response to this increasing shift towards learning (and testing) from home, this project will examine the security and privacy implications of remote proctoring services as they pertain to school policies and educational practices. This multi-pronged research program will examine how these services impact students, educators, and institutions' security and privacy. The research program is inspired by the widespread adoption of remote proctoring services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the findings will be more broadly applicable as institutions will likely continue to offer virtual classes and online technology services to support those classes.<br/><br/>The research activities are multidisciplinary and will advance knowledge in pedagogy as well as address vulnerabilities that stem from human behaviors and choices in security and privacy. Online proctoring technology requires extensive monitoring capabilities to work properly; these include systems for observing behavior (e.g., screen capture and video/audio recording) and restricting behavior (e.g., lock-down browsing and the installation of network firewall rules). In combination, these monitoring and restricting functionalities impose privacy and security risks on the students who are completing assignments in this setting. The research activities will directly address how students, educators, and institutions understand this exposure and its impact. Additionally, the project will identify the kinds of monitoring and restrictions that are effective and necessary. The research activities and findings will also contribute to fundamental research in usable security/privacy and educational research that considers the pedagogy and efficacy of online proctoring tools.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

The goal of the Summit is to develop a plan where Earth science majors have access to clear pathways that result in successful transfer within the state. Two-year colleges have the potential to be a source of increasing diversity of Earth science majors across the state. However, if the transfer process is unclear or inconsistent or does not effectively prepare students, there could be a bottleneck resulting in a decreasing number and diversity of bachelor's degree recipients. PIs anticipate that the partnerships and structures that will emerge from the Summit will improve both the number and diversity of successful students in geoscience programs. This Summit has the potential to develop a model that could be useful for other geoscience programs, including environmental science, meteorology, oceanography, agricultural and soil sciences, all programs which are generally discovered after students enter college. The Summit seeks to identify the unique barriers that may block transfer pathways in the Washington state system, and the solutions that reduce or remove these barriers that could be extrapolated and adapted nationally.<br/><br/>The Washington State Undergraduate Earth Sciences Summit will organize and convene a gathering of undergraduate faculty and advisors who will seek to  improve transfer pathways in Washington state. The Summit seeks to build a community of Earth science faculty in the State, and develop relationships between all undergraduate institutions that will facilitate the sharing of ideas and improvement of programs. Summit goals include (1) engagement of key stakeholders to foster discussions about Earth science opportunities through a lens of guided pathways and equity; (2) identification of threshold concept(s), competencies, and self-regulatory strategies that lead to successful transfer; (3) definition of successful transfer and identification of obstacles that impede students' progress in the Earth sciences; (4) exploration and initiation of future collaborations across colleges and institutions, and (5) identification of next steps for improvement of transfer processes at both the institutional level, between institutions, and in Washington state overall.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Much of this heat is lost to the atmosphere as cold winds blow over the ocean. This heat loss causes local changes in the solubility of carbon dioxide in seawater and increases mixing of the upper ocean. Both of these impacts affect the ocean?s ability to take up carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.  Knowledge of the ocean?s carbon uptake in this region is important for our ability to understand and predict the global carbon cycle that determines atmospheric carbon dioxide levels. Conditions in the Gulf Stream region change rapidly and are hard to sample, however. In this project, investigators will deploy a robotic glider for several weeks to measure temperature and salinity in the upper 1000 meters of the Gulf Stream region. The glider will overlap with other robotic vehicles called Saildrones that take measurements of surface waters and the atmosphere. Together these vehicles will produce a picture of ocean conditions and carbon uptake that is not possible with short-term sampling from ships. This project will support an early career scientist, a postdoctoral scholar, and a graduate student.<br/><br/>In this project, the Principal Investigators (PIs) will deploy one autonomous glider during the late spring-early summer of 2022 that will measure subsurface ocean properties in upper 1000 m of the Gulf Stream region.

Prior long-term studies in environmental biology uncovered the occurrence of acidification events in these lowland streams. Acidification events are short periods, from hours to days, when the water becomes moderately acid (low pH values). Their occurrence is the result of interactions between the stream and the surrounding forest and result from changes in rainfall. During the dry season organic materials accumulate on the forest floor, when the rains start these materials breakdown, releasing carbon dioxide that moves with the water into streams, creating acid conditions in streams (or lowering the water pH). Acidification events become extreme during El Nio years, which in Costa Rica has drier and wetter seasons than normal. Changes in acidification affect how streams function and the associated stream biodiversity. Projected changes in rainfall associated with global climate change could exacerbate the effects of acidification events on stream ecosystems. Prior research in lowland streams in Costa Rica indicate that stream invertebrates and algae can withstand moderately acid conditions, but are affected when conditions are extreme or more frequent. This Long-term Research in Environmental Biology (LTREB) award will investigate acidification effects on stream ecosystems in lowland Costa Rica.  Research will take place at La Selva Biological Station, on the Caribbean slope of Costa Rica, where streams have been under study for more than 30 years. The main objective of this award is to understand the mechanisms and consequences of changing rainfall patterns on the acidity and biotic response of tropical streams. This study would provide training opportunities for graduate students as well as outreach to the public.<br/><br/>This award will explore the consequences of the episodic acidification events and the hypothesis that an influx of soil-derived CO2 via subsurface flow paths contributes to those pH declines, signaling a tight coupling among rainfall, terrestrial, and aquatic ecosystems. Climate-driven acidification events are stronger and more common in solute-poor, poorly-buffered, streams than in solute-rich, well-buffered, streams - another characteristic of the study landscape. The award will continue evaluating this hypothesis by addressing three main objectives: (1) to assess relations among daily, seasonal, annual, and decadal patterns in stream water chemistry with major climate events (e.g., El Nio and La Nia - ENSO), focusing on extreme events using high frequency sampling. (2) Assess biotic responses to climate-driven acidification, focusing on event duration under laboratory conditions. Finally, (3) to supplement the experimental buffering of a low-solute stream with laboratory experiments of individual taxa. An analysis of the long-term records of stream macroinvertebrates indicates an overall decline in insects and strong differences in assemblage composition between solute-poor, poorly-buffered, streams compared to solute-rich, well-buffered, streams. Climate trends and global circulation models predict changes in the frequency and intensity of weather extremes. For Central America, models predict greater seasonality, similar to patterns observed during ENSO years. In the Caribbean lowlands of Costa Rica, El Nio events result in abnormally low precipitation during the dry season, while La Nia results is high precipitation. Thus, the award will advance the understanding of the consequences of extreme climate events on tropical lowland stream ecosystems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, it is doubtful that profit maximization is the only way to describe firms? behaviors. In a modern economy, ownership and management are separated for many firms, except for family-owned businesses. Owners are usually shareholders, and they get dividends from their own companies. Managers, such as a CEO and workers, get salaries from companies based on their working performances, indicated as profit and sales, revenue, market shares, or other quantitative indices. For example, suppose a manager?s salary is decided by his sales. Then, he will focus on increasing sales, which leads to a different outcome compared to the case where the manager?s salary is decided based on the firm?s profit. In other words, firms? behaviors depend on how managers? incentives are determined. Managers (delegated by owners) make decisions related to firms? operations, and this does not necessarily result in profit-maximizing behavior. Though there was some research about strategic delegation before, most economic research has assumed profit maximization, without considering strategic delegation. Therefore, this research will examine how firms? behaviors under strategic delegation are different from those obtained under pure profit maximization. <br/><br/>This experimental study uses a two-stage Cournot duopoly game to describe strategic delegation in a market (Vickers, 1985; Fershtman and Judd, 1987; Jansen et al., 2007). In the experiment, there are two firms in a market. Each firm consists of one owner and one manager. In Stage 1, both firm owners choose a contract determining the managers? incentives: profit delegation (only profit), revenue delegation (profit and weighted revenue), and market share delegation (profit and weighted market share). In Stage 2, managers choose whether or not to collude. Owners? and managers? selections will determine market output under strategic delegation. Theoretically, the market outcome under strategic delegation is more aggressive than that under profit maximization. Thus, this study will investigate whether the theoretical results are held under strategic delegation. This research will help understand firms? behaviors are more/less competitive than analyzed before. For example, Spierdijk and Zaouras (2017) show that the Lerner index obtained by profit maximization assumption is not appropriate to describe market power if firms do not maximize profit. As an extension of such research, this study will use experiments to identify firms? behaviors that are not profit-maximizing. Also, this project will contribute to improving structural models. Since the BLP model (Berry, Levinsohn, and Pakes, 1995) was proposed, demand estimation has been advanced, but the ?supply? part from the model still assumes profit maximization that leads to underestimating the marginal cost. Thus, the results of the experimental study will potentially help improve structural models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Every hour a young child under the age of 6 is hospitalized, and every 12 days a child dies in the United States due to unintentional medication ingestion. Studies have shown that improper use of safety caps by adults (only partially securing the cap or leaving it off entirely) contributes to unsupervised medication ingestions by young children. The proposed safety cap would prevent access by young children while also being easy to understand and operate by older senior adults, integrate with current high- speed manufacturing and distribution systems, and be cost-competitive. <br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase I project leverages the ergonomic differences between child and adult hand sizes, with differences in human-product interaction behavior, to develop more effective child-resistant packaging for medications.

It is therefore essential that individuals? preferences are correctly estimated.  Existing methods of estimating preferences assume that the researcher observes the set of all alternatives and the characteristics of each alternative available to the individual, as well as the characteristics of all individuals making choices.  However, the economics literature shows that individuals may not consider all alternatives available to them, or may not have access to all existing alternatives in the market in making choices. This mismatch between assumption and how people make choices may lead to mismeasurement of the estimates of individuals? preferences hence welfare analyses and policy evaluations based on these estimated preferences may be wrong. This research project develops new methods to identify and estimate the distribution of preferences that recognize that there can be dependence between preferences and consideration sets, and that consideration sets may depend on individuals? and alternatives? characteristics. The methodology developed in this study will help to better infer people?s wants from data, and hence help policy makers design better policies to the benefit of consumers. The researchers will write and freely distribute computer software to implement the new methods, hence make it easier for others to use these novel methods.  The results of this research project will improve prediction, improve policy making and therefore increase economic growth and improve the welfare of Americans.  <br/> <br/><br/>This research project develops a new class of models that combine preference heterogeneity and unobserved heterogeneity in consideration sets, with the goal of building discrete choice models that are:  (i) applicable in many economic settings (e.g.,  school and college choice,  insurance purchases,  vehicle choice); (ii) identifiable under conditions that are similar to those required for identification of standard discrete choice models with homogeneous consideration sets; (iii) easy to compute; and (iv) flexible enough to explain a wide range of market phenomena that standard models have difficulty explaining. A novel feature of the class of models is the unrestricted dependence between heterogeneous consideration and heterogeneous preferences, as well as dependence between consideration and regressors. The  contributions of this project include, establishing conditions for semi-nonparametric point identification on the new models; a maximum likelihood-based estimator that achieves significant  computational gains relative to existing state-of-the-art models of discrete choice; new testing methods for model specification and a new measure of model's goodness of fit; and methods to carry out robust welfare analysis and study policy questions.  The project will also develop and freely distribute software to implement the methods developed in this research.

For the first time, many instructors were faced with the dilemma of how to administer exams, quizzes effectively, and other in-class assignments in an online setting in which live, in-person proctoring was not available. Online proctoring quickly became an attractive option to monitor students remotely while completing an assignment. In response to this increasing shift towards learning (and testing) from home, this project will examine the security and privacy implications of remote proctoring services as they pertain to school policies and educational practices. This multi-pronged research program will examine how these services impact students, educators, and institutions' security and privacy. The research program is inspired by the widespread adoption of remote proctoring services in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. However, the findings will be more broadly applicable as institutions will likely continue to offer virtual classes and online technology services to support those classes.<br/><br/>The research activities are multidisciplinary and will advance knowledge in pedagogy as well as address vulnerabilities that stem from human behaviors and choices in security and privacy. Online proctoring technology requires extensive monitoring capabilities to work properly; these include systems for observing behavior (e.g., screen capture and video/audio recording) and restricting behavior (e.g., lock-down browsing and the installation of network firewall rules). In combination, these monitoring and restricting functionalities impose privacy and security risks on the students who are completing assignments in this setting. The research activities will directly address how students, educators, and institutions understand this exposure and its impact. Additionally, the project will identify the kinds of monitoring and restrictions that are effective and necessary. The research activities and findings will also contribute to fundamental research in usable security/privacy and educational research that considers the pedagogy and efficacy of online proctoring tools.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Secure and Trustworthy Cyberspace (SaTC) program, which funds proposals that address cybersecurity and privacy, and in this case specifically cybersecurity education.

In co-created, place-based learning experiences for Native youth, interweaving cultural traditions, arts, language, and community partnerships is vital for authentic, meaningful learning. Standardized STEM curricula and Western-based pedagogies within the mainstream and formal education systems do not reflect the nature of Native STEM knowledge, nor do they make deep connections to it. The absence of this knowledge base can reinforce a deficit-based STEM identity, which can directly impact Native youths? participation and engagement in STEM. Reframing STEM education for Native youth to prioritize the vitality of community and sustainability requires active consideration of what counts as science learning and who serves as holders and conduits of STEM knowledge. As highly regarded holders of traditional and western STEM knowledge, Native educators and cultural practitioners are critical for facilitating Native youths? curiosity and engagement with STEM. This Innovations in Development project is Native-led and centers Native knowledge, voice, and contributions in STEM through a culturally based, dual-learning approach that emphasizes traditional and western STEM knowledge. Through this lens, a network of over a dozen tribal nations across 20 U.S. states will be established to support and facilitate the learning of Traditional and Western STEM knowledge in a culturally sustaining manner. The network will build on existing programs and develop a set of unique, interconnected, and synchronized placed-based informal STEM programs for Native youth reflecting the distinctive cultural aspects of Native American and Alaska Native Tribes. The network will also involve a Natives-In-STEM Role Models innovation, in which Native STEM professionals will provide inspiration to Native youth through conversations about their journeys in STEM within cultural contexts. In addition, the network will cultivate a professional network of STEM educators, practitioners, and tribal leaders. Network efforts and the formative evaluation will culminate in the development and dissemination of a community-based, co-created Framework for Informal STEM Education with Native Communities.<br/><br/>Together with Elders and other contributors of each community, local leads within the STEM for Youth in Native Communities (SYNC) Network team will identify and guide the STEM content topics, as well as co-create and implement the program within their sovereign lands with their youth. The content, practitioners, and programming in each community will be distinct, but the community-based, dual learning contextual framework will be consistent. Each community includes several partner organizations poised to contribute to the programming efforts, including tribal government departments, tribal and public K-12 schools, tribal colleges, museums and cultural centers, non-profits, local non-tribal government support agencies, colleges and universities, and various grassroots organizations. Programmatic designs will vary and may include field excursions, summer and after school STEM experiences, and workshops. In addition, the Natives-In-STEM innovation will be implemented across the programs, providing youth with access to Native STEM professionals and career pathways across the country. To understand the impacts of SYNC?s efforts, an external evaluator will explore a broad range of questions through formative and summative evaluations. The evaluation questions seek to explore: (a) the extent to which the culturally based, dual learning methods implemented in SYNC informal STEM programs affect Native youths? self-efficacy in STEM and (b) how the components of SYNC?s overall theoretical context and network (e.g., partnerships, community contributors such as Elders, STEM practitioners and professionals) impact community attitudes and behaviors regarding youth STEM learning. Data and knowledge gained from these programs will inform the primary deliverable, a Framework for Native Informal STEM Education, which aims to support the informal STEM education community as it expands and deepens its service to Native youth and communities. Future enhanced professional development opportunities for teachers and educators to learn more about the findings and practices highlighted in the Framework are envisioned to maximize its strategic impact. <br/><br/>This Innovations and Development Project is a five year endeavor and supported by the Advancing Informal STEM Learning (AISL) program, which seeks to advance new approaches to, and evidence-based understanding of, the design and development of STEM learning in informal environments, multiple pathways for broadening access to and engagement in STEM learning experiences, advancing innovative research on and assessment of STEM learning in informal environments, and developing understandings of deeper learning by participants. The project is also co-funded by NSF Inclusion across the Nation of Communities of Learners of Underrepresented Discoverers in Engineering and Science (NSF INCLUDES), a comprehensive national initiative to enhance U.S. leadership in discoveries and innovations by focusing on diversity, inclusion and broadening participation in STEM at scale.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In agriculture, the primary challenge has been how to be more productive with less - less arable land, less water, less labor, less certainty. In arid lands, these challenges are amplified. Agricultural systems struggle to cope with rapid changes in water availability and land-use patterns, scarcity of labor due to declining population, variability and uncertainty related to changing weather and climate, and aging rural infrastructures. Arid lands and drylands, which cover much of the Western US, are expected to expand as the climate changes. Artificial intelligence (AI) can bring a paradigm shift in how the twin economic and environmental challenges of farming and ranching in arid lands can be addressed. AI can support farmers to operate with greater efficiency and precision through the assistance of autonomous systems (e.g., drones, ground vehicles, and intelligent irrigation systems) and the support of intelligent software systems to aid in decision making (e.g., detecting and resolving crop diseases). AI-driven solutions will not only enable farmers to do more with less; they will also improve quality and ensure a faster path-to-market for crops and livestock. This National Science Foundation Research Traineeship (NRT) award to New Mexico State University (NMSU) will enable the creation of a coordinated graduate training program, called Artificial Intelligence for Arid Land Agriculture (AIALA), to prepare the next generation of scholars and practitioners by teaching graduate students how to bridge the divides between AI and Agriculture for Arid Lands. The project anticipates training 33 MS and Ph.D. students, including 18 funded trainees, from computing-related disciplines and agriculture-related disciplines .<br/><br/>The AIALA scholar experience will integrate with and complement the traditional graduate disciplinary training, thus contextualizing the in-depth disciplinary research for researchers in either AI or agriculture-related areas. Moreover, the experience will allow scholars to effectively serve as catalysts in research teams using AI to solve arid land challenges. The research conducted by the AIALA scholars and their research mentors will advance the state of the art in both AI and Arid Land Agriculture. The research will promote the creation of novel multi-agent systems frameworks, advancing the state of the art in machine learning and distributed data analytics. In addition, it will provide methodologies and technologies to enhance the adaptability of crops, rangeland plants and livestock, improve the resiliency of livestock in expansive rugged rangelands, and ultimately lead to resilient and sustainable arid land agricultural systems. The AIALA training model benefits from a number of innovations. First, it establishes a transdisciplinary training pipeline, embedding AI research challenges in Arid Land Agricultural challenges, enabling contextualized and situated learning. Second, it integrates graduate students and faculty mentors in mutually supportive teams of learners, supported, in turn, by an extensive mentoring infrastructure. Third, it infuses diversity and inclusion in all operations and learning activities, promoting engagement of a diverse audience of scholars and preparing the scholars to serve as agents of change for inclusion. Finally, it emphasizes the development of professional skills as part of holistic disciplinary training.<br/><br/>The NSF Research Traineeship (NRT) Program is designed to encourage the development and implementation of bold, new potentially transformative models for STEM graduate education training. The program is dedicated to effective training of STEM graduate students in high priority interdisciplinary or convergent research areas through comprehensive traineeship models that are innovative, evidence-based, and aligned with changing workforce and research needs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the past, diseases during initial contact are believed to have led to mass mortality and likely influenced the outcome of colonization attempts. This doctoral dissertation project uses ancient DNA data to detect pathogens associated with conquest and colonization and determine how the pathogens evolved and why they were so deadly. The project outcomes can advance knowledge about the consequences of colonization as well as the evolution and ecology of diseases, many of which are still a struggle to treat and control today. The researchers emphasize substantive collaborations with descendant communities and community stakeholders. Local communities are actively involved in the project, and the research contributes to educational materials and museum exhibits in those regions. The project also fosters science communication and public outreach activities and provides laboratory training for undergraduates, including students from underrepresented groups in STEM.<br/><br/>This ancient pathogen genomics project aims to identify which specific pathogens were causing the widespread deaths of Indigenous people during European conquest, how these diseases evolved in a new environment, and how different environments and/or cultural practices may have led to differences in disease spread or mortality outcomes. The study examines data generated from approximately 200 individuals from four strategically selected early contact-era sites of differing ecological and cultural environments. The researchers use gold-standard ancient pathogen genomics methods to sequence the DNA of these pathogens, determine their evolutionary trees, confirm their European origin, discover how and when they may have evolved into modern-day strains, and detect hybridization or diversification events. Where there is enough data, the researchers also perform functional analyses to identify variants through specific defining markers such as any gene loss or gain important for virulence or pathogenicity. In addition to standard high-throughput genomics and bioinformatics methods, this study incorporates historical accounts, disease ecology, and archaeological contexts to uncover a more comprehensive perspective of key events in human history.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is relevant in the context of global climate change where extreme flooding is expected to occur more frequently and at larger magnitudes. Many of the modern structures that were damaged during the flooding in Germany are similar to structures found across the United States and knowledge gained from studying this flooding event will be transferable to the built environment in the United States.

Geophysical field measurements in the riverbed will include rotary side scan sonar, high resolution chirp sonar, and single beam sonar. This will enable collection of channel bathymetry and sediment stratigraphy, which may reveal novel information on if or how changes in substrata in the upper meter of the river bed play a significant role in sediment mobilization and instability during extreme hydraulic events. Both ground-based and airborne LiDAR surveys will provide high-resolution, 3D models of the riverbanks and surrounding structures, enabling assessment of potential interaction between erosive patterns and structural damage.

The main inherent challenge in conventional von Neumann computer architecture is the latency caused by the data transfer between computer processing and memory units, also known as von Neumann bottleneck. Neuromorphic computing, emulating the energy-efficient and highly-parallel operations of the human brain, stands as a promising platform to address this challenge. Neuromorphic circuitry built on memristor devices enables efficient information storage in the form of resistance states, emulation of biological synaptic functionalities, and in-memory computing (i.e. via matrix-vector multiplication). Large-scale adoption of neuromorphic computing technology is currently hindered by multifaceted challenges in the materials, device and algorithm levels that are exacerbated by long-prototyping cycles of conventional microfabrication techniques. This NSF proposal aims to develop a data-driven, high-throughput and customizable manufacturing platform for neuromorphic circuits, based on nanoscale 3D printing, that will enable design freedom in both the materials and device architecture levels. The project?s broader impacts include a new generation of application-specific computational hardware that is indispensable for fueling the future implementations of AI and critical to increase U.S. competitiveness in the IC industry.

Several photosensitizer chemical compounds (fullerene C70 and C60, rubrene, and methylene blue with urea) will be evaluated on system longevity by continuously cycling the systems under higher temperatures and light exposure, and monitoring their effects on oxygen production. A prototype will then be developed that generates targeted oxygen flow rates at the desired rate of energy consumption, and the oxygen produced validated as safe for inhalation using bench tests.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These data will be interrogated to provide insight into how channel geometry, flow conditions, the presence of debris, and geotechnical properties affect performance of engineered structures interacting with extreme floods. This is relevant in the context of global climate change where extreme flooding is expected to occur more frequently and at larger magnitudes. Many of the modern structures that were damaged during the flooding in Germany are similar to structures found across the United States and knowledge gained from studying this flooding event will be transferable to the built environment in the United States. Data generated during the project can provide support to update infrastructure design and flood mitigation strategies to meet future demands intensified by climate change.<br/><br/>The specific goal of this research is to provide new data and knowledge on the impact of extreme flooding events on infrastructure and the effects of urban land usage and environmental conditions. Through this data collection, a detailed set of case studies that document sediment dynamics in the vicinity of infrastructure and in urban river sections will facilitate identification of features and processes that potentially influence performance of engineered structures during extreme flooding. Geophysical field measurements in the riverbed will include rotary side scan sonar, high resolution chirp sonar, and single beam sonar. This will enable collection of channel bathymetry and sediment stratigraphy, which may reveal novel information on if or how changes in substrata in the upper meter of the river bed play a significant role in sediment mobilization and instability during extreme hydraulic events. Both ground-based and airborne LiDAR surveys will provide high-resolution, 3D models of the riverbanks and surrounding structures, enabling assessment of potential interaction between erosive patterns and structural damage. Multispectral images will be collected using drone-based technology to identify broader erosive and depositional patterns. Geotechnical field measurements will include pocket free fall penetrometer, pocket erodometer, field vane shear, and field fall cone measurements in addition to sample collection for laboratory measurements. The geotechnical observations, coupled with the geophysical and remote sensing data, will enable a comprehensive assessment of how sediments were eroded and transported near engineered structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A key property that enables digital information to be stored in ever shrinking nanoscale magnets is the ability of the media to maintain its magnetization, known as the magnetic anisotropy. Traditional high magnetic anisotropy materials contain rare-earth elements, which are prone to price fluctuations and supply chain issues. Currently, certain alloys of FePt in a tetragonal phase are being pursued in heat-assisted magnetic recording media, but they contain precious metals.  It is critical to advance the magnetic recording technology using high anisotropy materials based on earth-abundant elements. Recent progresses in high entropy alloys offer an exciting new arena to realize novel types of high anisotropy materials. These materials are multi-element alloys with high configurational entropy, allowing stabilization of metastable phases. This project will explore the high entropy alloy approach to develop novel multi-element phases with high magnetic anisotropy as magnetic recording media that cannot be achieved by conventional means. To effectively explore the essentially infinite combinations of the multi-element alloys, an iterative synthesis, characterization, simulation and machine learning approach is adapted, to quickly identify the most promising alloy phases and improve their performance metrics. Magnetic recording media developed using high entropy alloys have potentially transformative technological impacts. The effective machine learning method developed will benefit not only explorations of high entropy alloys, but also numerous other applications. The principal investigators actively promote broader participation through education and outreach efforts to engage students at all levels, as well as extensive service activities in the magnetism community. <br/><br/>High entropy materials with strong magnetic anisotropy are investigated for applications as magnetic recording media. A synergetic and iterative high-throughput approach is employed, to survey the vast parameter space and expedite the research progress towards recording media development. Thin films of high entropy alloys are synthesized via combinatorial fabrication, exploring large composition variations. Structural characterizations of crystal structure, phase stability and morphology are performed by x-ray diffraction and electron microscopy. Quantitative magnetic phase identification and magnetization reversal characteristics are investigated using magnetometry and the first-order reversal curve method. Magnetic correlation length scales are probed by neutron scattering and compared with sample microstructures. Machine learning is employed to aid design and optimization of alloy composition and growth parameter space, forming iterative feedback loops with experiments. This includes the development of predictive machine learning using conventional models and existing data, training a Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Network (WGAN) to resolve the overfitting issue, searching for the maximized magnetic anisotropy, and realizing machine-learning-assisted high throughput characterization. An experiment-machine learning iteratively derived prototype magnetic recording media is demonstrated. A key bottleneck of stabilizing high anisotropy phases via the conventional approaches is circumvented via the configurational entropy route. The eventual scaling up from thin films into bulk materials can potentially transform many other industry sectors. A large-size high entropy alloy database containing both the experimental and WGAN-generated labeled data is publicly available. The research activities are integrated with a wide variety of education and outreach efforts for student training and broadening participation from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To mitigate erosion-related damages and habitat losses, restoration projects import sediment to eroded areas. The success of these restoration efforts depends on their ability to retain sediment, so that restoration design requires a good understanding of sediment transport. Currently, there are established methods for predicting the transport of non-cohesive sediment, such as sand and gravel, relative to flow conditions and sediment particle size. However, it remains difficult to predict the transport of cohesive sediment, such as clay or mud, which is ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems and consists of very fine particles. Predicting cohesive sediment transport is challenging because these fine particles have a strong tendency to stick together and form aggregates. These aggregates greatly change the effective size of the sediment particles and their interaction with the flow. This project will combine experiments and numerical simulations at a range of scales to understand how fine cohesive particles form aggregates and how aggregation controls the transport of sediment in water. Predictive equations for cohesive sediment transport will be developed. The results of this study will help improve designs of restoration projects to mitigate erosion-driven property and habitat losses. Next-generation environmental scientists and engineers will be trained at the graduate, postdoctoral, and undergraduate levels. Science videos about erosion will be created and disseminated to the public. Demonstration experiments will be used to raise K-12 students? interest in environmental science and public understanding of erosion. <br/><br/>This study will combine multiscale experiments and numerical simulations to understand the fundamental physical factors governing cohesive sediment transport. The study will directly address key challenges related to the multiscale and multiphysics nature of cohesive sediment transport dynamics that currently inhibit understanding of these processes. This includes the fact that transport that occurs at channel and ecosystem scales is controlled by the micro- to mesoscale interactions between nanometer-size clay particles, which are the main contributors to sediment cohesiveness, and by the multiphysics couplings between particle mechanics and fluid flow. The planned research will combine nano- to microscale confocal imaging and coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations, micro- to mesoscale millifluidic experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, and channel scale flume and outdoor stream experiments and CFD simulations to fundamentally understand the critical impacts of clay aggregation and gelation on channel-scale cohesive sediment transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These interactions are being disrupted around the globe due to human activities, and such disruptions can have cascading effects on communities, ecosystems, and human well-being. In groups of interacting species, as examined in this study, species may vary in their roles in the community: the loss of some species can have large impacts on the community, while the loss of others may have little to no effect. Determining which species to target for conservation requires understanding the roles that species play, the importance of behavior in maintaining species interactions, and how loss of particular species alters the community. Yet, these questions have received little attention. Further, insight into how interactions may vary in response to changing environments can be gained from examining if, how, and why the loss of different types of species alters or disrupts species interactions. This project will include training of underrepresented early career scientists and an undergraduate field-based course in Panama, supported by team-wide training in mentoring to increase equity and inclusivity. The team will also develop open educational research modules for use at the undergraduate level across multiple universities.<br/><br/>To examine species interactions and the links between behavior and community ecology, researchers will study one type of mixed-species animal group, army-ant-following birds, using a well-replicated network analytic and experimental approach in tropical forests.

In particular, this study will evaluate the behavioral roles of species within these groups, whether roles vary across contexts, and whether temporary loss of a species with differing roles alters (1) the structure of the group during the formation stage (when the group is first forming), and (2) the behaviors, net benefits of interacting, and structure during the maintenance stage (after they have formed). This will be done by conducting two experiments - an acoustic species removal experiment during the formation stage and a physical species removal experiment during the maintenance stage. In each experiment, species with differing behavioral roles will be removed. Behavioral observations will be conducted to assess the impacts of species loss on recruitment, foraging, competition, and group structure.

As a result they evolved tools to resist their enemies. However, there is also evidence of collaboration between microbes (endosymbiosis), where bacteria live inside fungal cells. We have shown that, together, a bacterial endosymbiont and its fungal host create a holobiont that can make a powerful toxin that blocks soil-dwelling amoebae from engulfing the fungus. This endosymbiotic bacterium also changes how the fungus controls its own gene expression to fight different kinds of stress. This project examines how frequently fungi and endosymbionts evade amoebae; the implications for fungal housing of endosymbionts; and whether these symbioses lead to co-evolution. To answer these questions, we will look at bacterial-fungal partnerships across a wide range of species, looking for differences and commonalities in their shared genomes. We will also record reactions of wild-type and mutant fungal-bacterial endosymbionts with amoebae in the lab to identify the different strategies they can take to evade amoebae engulfment. Finally, we will examine one endosymbiont pair in depth to understand the mechanisms that allow these partnerships to exist. Amoebae are very similar to the cells in the human immune system that are the first line of defense against infection. Thus, this study can help our understanding of immunity. Additional broader impacts of this proposal include developing fungal biological education modules and teaching resources in the K-6 classrooms, develop mushroom grow kits for children, and participation in science podcasts. <br/> <br/>Identifying how environmental fungi developed traits to evade immune cells is critical to understanding the causes of opportunistic fungal infections in nature and in humans. Mucoromycota are primarily soil-associated fungi, some of which are also opportunistic mammalian pathogens. We recently identified an endosymbiosis between Betaproteobacteria Ralstonia (bacterium) and Mucoromycota Rhizopus (fungus), a symbiosis that blocks engulfment and killing of the fungus by the soil-dwelling amoeba Dictyostelium and also confers virulence in animals. Endosymbioses between Betaproteobacteria and Mucoromycota are environmentally ubiquitous. Endosymbionts are also observed in approximately half of clinical Rhizopus isolates, where phagocyte-related deficiencies are a major predictor of susceptibility. We hypothesize that interactions between bacterium-fungus holobionts and soil amoeba drive their evolutionary trajectories and opportunistic virulence in mammals. We will use phenotypic, genomic, and molecular tools to dissect the holobiont-phagocyte interaction and investigate host-pathogen interactions at two levels: 1) interactions between bacteria and their fungal hosts, and 2) the effect of endosymbionts on phagocyte evasion and opportunistic virulence. We will take both an unbiased approach to survey bacterial-fungal-amoebal interactions across the genus and a directed approach to investigate the molecular mechanisms for specific bacterial-fungal isolates alone and with amoeba.

This project will provide a fellowship to an Assistant Professor and training for a graduate student at the University of Oklahoma and will use a novel and cost-efficient mesoscopic imaging technique for functional brain imaging in living mice. Additionally, the project will take advantage of the cutting-edge microscopy at Cornell University to validate this imaging technique and further investigate the brain circuit. The researcher along with one Ph.D. student will spend a 6-months visit to the host lab at Cornell University to initiate research collaborations. The validated mesoscopic imaging platform has potential to provide a significant improvement over the current imaging system and will become a powerful tool for neuroscientists to investigate the neural activities in the mouse cortex in vivo. Furthermore, this validated imaging platform can be broadly used to study numerous neurological disorders, such as Alzheimer?s disease, and aid in devising better diagnostic and treatment strategies.  Through this fellowship, the researcher will learn and master these cutting-edge microscopy techniques and bring this knowledge back to the University of Oklahoma to benefit >50 researchers?thus enhancing the research capability in Oklahoma.   <br/><br/>Technical Description:<br/>The neural circuits in the mammalian cortex play important roles in higher brain function. Due to the limited thickness of the mouse cortex (organized in 6 horizontal layers in ~1 mm depth) and the distance between different cortical areas (~ several millimeters), most of the currently employed methods for brain functional imaging are unable to adequately study the layer-specific interactions within the cortex. This is due to at least one of the following major limitations: limited field of view, shallow penetration depth, limited spatial and/or temporal resolution. To investigate the three-dimensional (3D) layer-specific interaction in the mouse cortex and between different cortical areas in vivo, the researcher developed a novel mesoscopic imaging technique that can achieve a resolution of ~30-100 m with millimeters imaging depth. On the other hand, recent advances in three-photon microscopy have made it possible to image through the mouse cortex for both structural and functional imaging. The research objective of this proposal is to: 1) validate this novel mesoscopic 3D imaging method using the state-of-art three-photon microscopy at Cornell University; and 2) investigate the functional consequences of the layer-specific projections in whisker sensorimotor circuit. In addition to validating the mesoscopic imaging system, the study has potential to help uncover the layer-specific neural functional connections between the somatosensory cortex and primary motor cortex by combining both the advanced imaging methods and optogenetic control strategy. These novel imaging platforms will enable neuroscientists to investigate the 3D neural connections across different cortical regions of live animals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project explores the mechanistic and evolutionary bases of early life effects on later life biological outcomes in groups living in environments that are dramatically different from those they encountered early in life. Insights from such groups, who are undergoing rapid lifestyle changes due to increasing market integration, acculturation, and urbanization, advance knowledge about biological connections across the lifespan, in the context of biocultural theory. The project may also inform global health research, given that many human groups are undergoing similar lifestyle changes, as well as inform our understanding of the complex causes of some of the greatest health threats faced by people in the United States and other high-income countries. The research provides many scientific training opportunities for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students, as well as participating community members. Through partnerships with mobile clinics, this research is also directly contributing to improving health care among participating groups. <br/><br/>In order to uncover the mechanistic and evolutionary bases of early life effects on later life biological outcomes, this research has three general goals. First, the researchers use detailed interviews and direct measurements of numerous behavioral, anthropometric, and physiological traits to characterize the early life and current environments of study participants and their current physiological status. Second, using these data and previously established modeling methods, the researchers test competing explanations for how early life effects on later life health evolve, including the well-known but insufficiently tested ?developmental constraints'' and ?predictive adaptive responses? hypotheses. Third, the researchers are using cutting-edge genomic techniques to identify the genes and gene regulatory processes that mediate early life environmental influences on later life health by measuring genome-wide DNA methylation and gene expression levels and linking these genomic mechanisms to both the environmental stimuli to which they are responsive and their downstream health consequences. An especially innovative and promising feature of this research is that it integrates theory and methods from a variety of scientific fields including human evolutionary biology, behavioral ecology, epidemiology, biomedicine, and genomics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed project develops a test that would cost $50 per sample (6X reduction) and could test about 120 samples per day (4X increase).  It could initially offer a rapid, low-cost qualitative screening tool, allowing users to determine areas of concern, hot spots, detection during emergency response and testing during mitigation efforts. <br/><br/>The proposed project will develop a novel immunoassay in the form of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of PFOA (perfluorooctanoic acid) and PFOS (perfluorooctane sulfonic acid), two of the most abundant PFAS in soil and water. Currently, PFAS testing involves laboratory-based, costly LC-MS (Liquid chromatography?mass spectrometry) methods. An antibody test such as an ELISA has specificity to the target compound as well as any similarly structured compounds. Thus, the test will detect multiple species of the perfluorinated compounds.  During the development of PFAS ELISA, verification testing will be done in an EPA lab using LC-MS to verify the species that can be detected by the ELISA test along with the accompanying levels of detection.  The research will include determination of the appropriate immunogens and haptens for this application, antibody production, and screening of antibody for specificity and sensitivity. The goal is to improve PFAS detection sensitivity to 50 ppt.

This is a solid-state approach that can offer significant advantages in applications where size, cost, speed, and reliability are important, such as renewable energy, solid-state refrigeration, and distributed power generation. Though promising, the approach requires exceptional control over light emission and absorption processes to achieve high performance. The goal of this project is to address this technological gap by developing an innovative device, consisting of Inter-Digitated Emitters and Absorbers of Light (IDEAL), that virtually eliminates photon loss and thus bridges the gap relative to theoretical limits. Such devices can leapfrog the limitations of current mechanical processes and enable a societal transition to a clean and sustainable energy system. This project will also introduce the principles of optical thermodynamics to under-resourced schools in metro Detroit and offer workshops that demystify graduate school, thus expanding STEM opportunities.<br/><br/><br/><br/>With advances in manufacturing enabling high-quality photovoltaic materials, the key barrier to high performance in thermo-photonic devices has become the ability to selectively absorb above-bandgap photons, suppress parasitic absorption of luminescent photons, and maintain efficiency at elevated power densities. These shortcomings have resulted in significant efficiency losses relative to thermodynamic limits. This project will address this gap by developing an innovative device concept, named IDEAL, that features interdigitated photovoltaic absorbers and thermal/luminescent emitters. The novelty of the IDEAL approach is that it (1) creates lines of symmetry that act as perfect broadband reflectors and (2) enhances the power density while preserving efficiency. The project will implement the concept in two model material systems to test its generality and map out the coupling between thermal and optoelectronic properties to provide design rules for high performance. The expected result is almost an order of magnitude reduction in photon loss probabilities compared to current performance in photovoltaics and light-emitting diodes, which will yield large gains in the thermodynamic efficiency of thermophotovoltaic power generation and electroluminescent refrigeration. The IDEAL geometry has the added benefit of potentially enabling power densities that are only accessible to near-field approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The hallmark of this survival is their unique ability to form a ?tun,? a survival state achieved through withdrawing of limbs, expelling internal water stores, and significantly decreasing metabolism. Tardigrades can remain in this state for years while remaining relatively undamaged, emerging only when the external threat has been removed. However, how this survival is regulated is largely unknown. The investigators' work has revealed a dependence of tardigrade survival on the presence of highly reactive oxygen-containing chemicals, small cellular messengers present in all living systems. These chemicals are essential signaling molecules that alter metabolic activity through the modification of proteins within the cell.  The multidisciplinary team of scientists from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill and Marshall University can track these signals and affected biological compounds within tardigrades through powerful analytical and biochemical methods. The investigator team will combine these approaches to comprehensively map the entrance and emergence of tardigrade into and from tun across unique stresses allowing them to determine the precise adaptations that enable extreme stress tolerance. This work is integral to understanding molecular strategies for extreme stress tolerance within cells that can be applied to understand stress across life on earth.  The collaborative teams will create sister courses on their campus, working across institutions to characterize different tardigrade proteins.  In addition, students will be engaged in undergraduate research and gain experience in protein chemistry, computational modeling, and scientific literacy.<br/><br/>Tardigrades (water bears) are cosmopolitan microscopic invertebrates that respond quickly to environmental stressors using ingenious modes of extremotolerance collectively known as cryptobiosis. Understanding the regulatory processes governing tardigrade cryptobiosis is essential to revealing the molecular strategies that preserve biochemical pathways when exposed to extreme stress. While cryptobiosis is prevalent across taxa, there exists only a nascent understanding of the molecular mechanisms and to what extent different types are interconnected. We are far from a comprehensive understanding of the biochemical participants, the coordination among diverse networks, or of the interplay between stress and survival. A multi-disciplinary team will combine their expertise in proteomics and reactive oxygen species monitoring with the aim of elucidating the redox-dependence of tardigrade extremotolerance. They will characterize tardigrade survival on both a physiological and proteomic level, enabling enhanced understanding of the molecular mechanisms through which tardigrades survive various hostile environments. Project outcomes include: a) the identification and characterization of essential redox-modified proteins required for cryptobiosis induction; b) the mapping of redox signaling across distinct cryptobioses; and c) the identification of key regulatory points in the tardigrade ?cryptobiome?. This work will generate the most comprehensive biomolecular framework for cryptobiosis, to date.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Student researchers will work with faculty mentors in computer science and digital humanities to map the granular process of emancipation in Mississippi during the Civil War and through the period of Reconstruction to visualize freed-people's paths to citizenship.  This project was inspired by three factors: (1) the need for more individuals from economically underprivileged backgrounds in computer science and digital humanities; (2) evidence that underprivileged students are more likely to enter and stay in science and engineering fields if their first interaction is with material they recognize and find socially significant; and, (3) the need for sophisticated, but user-friendly mapping technology in digital humanities and comparable fields of scholarship. The historical focus on emancipation is somewhat familiar to most students, but how that process evolved for the nearly half-million enslaved Mississippians in the 1860s and 1870s is largely unknown to them. This project will help REU students develop a deeper understanding of historical change over time, and demonstrate how similar computer-based methods can be applied to analyze and visualize complex periods of history.<br/><br/>This project will bring together humanities students from diverse backgrounds, especially those underrepresented in science, engineering, and digital humanities, to enable them to make significant contributions to collaborative research and to learn to work effectively as an individual and part of this REU community. They will include African Americans, women, first-generation college students, other minorities, and military veterans. The experience will increase students' familiarity and comfort with computer science and digital humanities topics and research, including commonly used methods, software, and analytical tools. To enhance their active participation in research, students will receive training in the fundamentals of each field, including systematic geography and geographic information systems. A fundamental goal is to increase student interest in pursuing graduate studies toward a career in research and provide them with the experience and training needed to improve the likelihood of their success. In addition, this work will demonstrate the research potential of accessible yet sophisticated mapping technology for STEM and non-STEM fields through the students' presentation of their research in academic settings and its use outside the REU program.

Salish Kootenai College and Blackfeet Community College are both Tribal Colleges. Over its six-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 105 unique full-time STEM students who are pursuing associate and/or bachelor degrees in Biological and Biomedical Sciences, Mathematics and Statistics, Physical Sciences, Engineering, Computer and Information Sciences, and/or Natural Resources and Conservation. First-year students in Bachelor degree programs will receive four-year scholarships while transfer students and first-year students in Associate degree programs will receive two-year scholarships. Students in the project will have access to a wide variety of supports such as individual mentoring from STEM faculty members and peers and monthly professional development opportunities with students from all four institutions. One of the unique features of the program is the collaboration between four institutions. This increased partnership between public research institutions and Tribal Colleges will facilitate a bidirectional sharing of best practices for mentoring, inclusive instruction, and student support. The partnership will also provide students with access to peers and faculty members at three other institutions within the state.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. The aims of this project are to increase the first-year retention and graduation rates for each student cohort, improve transition after graduation to either a STEM career or further higher education, and advance knowledge about issues and factors impacting advancement along the academic pathway. Montana faces post-secondary persistence challenges with two of its largest population groups: Native Americans and individuals from extremely rural areas. Each group faces unique persistence challenges, with some commonalities (e.g., strong ties to family/land, culture shock, stereotypes). Students with positive STEM-based identities perform better academically and are more likely to persist to earn a degree and stay in a STEM field. However, STEM-based identities can clash with personal identities, especially for students from marginalized communities. This project will add understanding in how to develop integrated identities that incorporate STEM identities and personal/cultural identities. To address the question of integrated identities, the social science research team will use a mixed-methods design. Findings will be synthesized into culturally-attuned, place-based knowledge that is useful for teaching, mentorship, and policy in STEM programs at Tribal and non-Tribal Colleges and Universities. This project will disseminate research findings, successes, and lessons learned to appropriate stakeholders via local and community meetings, presentations at regional and national events, and publications in relevant journals. These dissemination activities will take place on each campus and within communities as appropriate (e.g. Tribal Council meetings, community forums, and contribution to newsletters, websites, and other venues). This project is funded by NSF's Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, the technological realization of safe and dynamic behaviors in bipedal robots remains challenging due to the fundamental lack of understanding of underlying mechanisms of locomotion controllers. Such understanding will also help improve assistive devices such as lower-limb exoskeletons, which could help restore mobility lost due to stroke or other movement disorders. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project aims to significantly advance the technology of bipedal robots and lower-limb exoskeletons through a novel learning-based feedback motion control framework, with a specific focus on experimentally realizing safe and dynamic bipedal locomotion in real-world settings. Inspired by how humans learn complex tasks hierarchically, this project will make major innovations to motion control for safe bipedal locomotion through a physics-inspired hierarchical structure. Moreover, we will leverage the innate appeal of bipedal robots in our coordinated education and outreach plans to engage students of various levels in STEM education and research programs. The successful completion of this project has the potential to accelerate real-world applications of bipedal robots in industry and public health and improve the depth of the STEM talent pool.<br/><br/>Bipedal robots are inherently unstable and consist of many degrees of freedom. Despite current achievements in robot manipulation and mobile robots, typical reinforcement learning (RL) algorithms are prone to fail and are difficult to scale when used for bipedal robots. The robot will fall without proper control, resulting in very sparse and discontinuous rewards, causing the RL algorithms not to converge. The high dimensionality of bipedal robots also increases the search space of the classic ?flat? RL algorithms, leading to sampling inefficiency and a lengthy (potentially unsuccessful) training process. Many existing applications of RL on bipedal robots do not respect the physical limitations of the robot, and consequently, cannot be implemented on robot hardware. This research will therefore address these scientific challenges by pursuing the following four research goals: (G1) develop a hierarchical learning structure that enables the robot to efficiently explore the high-dimensional behavior space by reducing the task complexity through the temporal abstraction of skills at different levels, (G2) design a probabilistically safe ?safety filter? to ensure and guide safe policy learning via control barrier functions, (G3) improve learning efficiency through guided policy exploration that imitates physics-inspired template models in a layered fashion, and finally (G4) bridge the ?sim-to-real? gap for real-world deployments. The resulting framework will be experimentally demonstrated with a 3D bipedal robot (Digit) in real-world settings and a lower-limb exoskeleton (ATALANTE) in pre-clinical trials with non-Spinal-Cord-Injury healthy human subjects.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To mitigate erosion-related damages and habitat losses, restoration projects import sediment to eroded areas. The success of these restoration efforts depends on their ability to retain sediment, so that restoration design requires a good understanding of sediment transport. Currently, there are established methods for predicting the transport of non-cohesive sediment, such as sand and gravel, relative to flow conditions and sediment particle size. However, it remains difficult to predict the transport of cohesive sediment, such as clay or mud, which is ubiquitous in aquatic ecosystems and consists of very fine particles. Predicting cohesive sediment transport is challenging because these fine particles have a strong tendency to stick together and form aggregates. These aggregates greatly change the effective size of the sediment particles and their interaction with the flow. This project will combine experiments and numerical simulations at a range of scales to understand how fine cohesive particles form aggregates and how aggregation controls the transport of sediment in water. Predictive equations for cohesive sediment transport will be developed. The results of this study will help improve designs of restoration projects to mitigate erosion-driven property and habitat losses. Next-generation environmental scientists and engineers will be trained at the graduate, postdoctoral, and undergraduate levels. Science videos about erosion will be created and disseminated to the public. Demonstration experiments will be used to raise K-12 students? interest in environmental science and public understanding of erosion. <br/><br/>This study will combine multiscale experiments and numerical simulations to understand the fundamental physical factors governing cohesive sediment transport. The study will directly address key challenges related to the multiscale and multiphysics nature of cohesive sediment transport dynamics that currently inhibit understanding of these processes. This includes the fact that transport that occurs at channel and ecosystem scales is controlled by the micro- to mesoscale interactions between nanometer-size clay particles, which are the main contributors to sediment cohesiveness, and by the multiphysics couplings between particle mechanics and fluid flow. The planned research will combine nano- to microscale confocal imaging and coarse-grained molecular dynamics (CGMD) simulations, micro- to mesoscale millifluidic experiments and computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, and channel scale flume and outdoor stream experiments and CFD simulations to fundamentally understand the critical impacts of clay aggregation and gelation on channel-scale cohesive sediment transport.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Workshop topics will include how to: facilitate the spread of useful information while reducing misinformation, combine judgments from many individuals (humans and other animals) for improved decision making, create policies and infrastructures that allow groups to effectively solve their shared problems, best combine the strengths of human and computer problem solving to create systems more advanced than either component on their own, and use computers to make human learning more efficient and flexible.   The workshops will feature panelist presentations organized into themes and monthly group discussions.  A broader impact of the workshop is to provide a venue for students anywhere in the world to learn about exciting developments in augmented intelligence.  For students coming from smaller universities with few resources for research, the workshop would provide exposure to state-of-the-art research and opportunities to interact with leading researchers in this emerging field.  The topic of augmented intelligence represents an exciting area of research that can inform many applications including: the optimization of team coordination, the design of intelligent tutoring systems,  computer support for human decision making, and the organization of social media platforms.<br/><br/>This two-part, temporally and geographically distributed workshop will integrate perspectives from cognitive scientists, computer scientists, education researchers, neuroscientists, and biologists to lay the foundations of a shared conceptual framework for a new science of augmented intelligence, premised on the observation that people very rarely solve problems or develop understandings on their own.  Instead, people recruit other people and technologies to help them, and to such a large extent that the apt unit for understanding cognition is typically not an individual person, but rather a larger system that incorporates multiple people and the tools that they created to enhance their capabilities. The workshop participants will grapple with theoretical and applied questions involving the nature of minds, how adaptive systems come into existence that can robustly solve a wide range of problems, and how humans and machines can complement each other?s strengths during learning and knowledge creation. The workshop seeks to stimulate new research directions at the confluence of theoretical, empirical, and technological advances that hold promise of developing an integrative science of augmented intelligence, drawling from multiple disciplinary perspectives.  Deliverable products from the workshop will include online public videos of participants? lectures, archives of conversations, and special issues of journals devoted to augmented intelligence.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studies show that disrupting the course of development of the gut microbiome with antibiotics can increase body fat and the linked risk of obesity and disease later in life. These effects can differ between females and males.  This doctoral dissertation research investigates how antibiotic use causes increased body fat, frames this effect in an evolutionary context, and examines why sex differences in this effect arise. Combining these areas of focus allows this investigation of cause-effect relationships important for understanding how factors experienced in early life impact health outcomes later in life, and in addition to the potential to inform public health research, the results speak to larger theoretical frameworks in biological anthropology.  This research provides intensive training for a female graduate student and opportunities for undergraduate students, particularly members of groups currently underrepresented in STEM fields to gain robust research experience. <br/><br/>Environmental adversity during early life can cue developmental changes in young animals that promote metabolic diseases in adults such as obesity. The gut microbiome plays critical roles in the regulation of host energy balance, with disruption of the gut microbiome through antibiotic use causing short-term weight and fat loss. Notably, despite short-term energy losses, exposure to antibiotics in early life has been linked to obesity and overweight in adulthood in humans, mice, livestock, and other animals. However, the physiological mechanisms underlying these long-term obesogenic effects remain unclear. The investigators hypothesize that gut microbiota depletion during the critical period of early life constrains energy budgets, necessitating energy allocation tradeoffs that persist in adulthood at the cost of fitness. To test this hypothesis, the investigators profile the gut microbiome and host energy allocation over the course of development in a conventional mouse model of early-life antibiotic treatment, followed by direct evaluation of immune and reproductive fitness in adulthood. The proposed study provides novel evidence linking disciplines concerned with the developmental origins of health and disease to those concerned with the gut microbiota and host-microbial interactions. The results of this research contribute to theoretical discussions regarding trade-offs following early life influence and illuminates the factors contributing to rising rates of metabolic diseases across the globe.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In addition, this project proposes to improve the pathway for the recruitment, education, and retention of those future teachers in urban public schools. This will be accomplished by understanding the local needs for mathematics, science, and computer science teachers in urban settings, including understanding how to improve teacher preparation programs to meet such needs. This Capacity Building project is expected to lay the groundwork for the future preparation and submission of a Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program proposal. <br/><br/>This project at Texas Wesleyan University (TWU), a private primarily undergraduate serving university, includes partnerships with Tarrant County College District, an open-access community college district; the Fort Worth Independent School District, a high-need school district; Leadership Academy Network, a community-based organization; and the University of Texas at Arlington, a public research university. Project goals are to (1) strengthen the existing mathematics and science teacher certification tracks and develop a new Grade 7-12 computer science teacher certification track at TWU; (2) strengthen and expand partnerships with Fort Worth K-12 and postsecondary institutions, with an intentional focus on the recruitment, preparation, and retention of STEM teachers; and (3) establish, maintain, and expand Fort Worth community-based STEM outreach partnerships. To accomplish these goals, this project will utilize an extensive catalog of needs assessments to advance knowledge, increase STEM teacher effectiveness, enhance infrastructure, and advocate for underrepresented populations. This project will build an understanding of best practices for building a pathway for recruiting future STEM teachers from urban school districts into two-year and four-year institutions, with the goal of returning these students to the urban school districts as highly qualified STEM teachers. In this way, the project will create a positive feedback loop for teacher preparation. Additionally, this project seeks to examine the Leadership Academy Network model, a public charter school, as a teaching laboratory for early field experiences with first- and second-year undergraduate students who have interests in STEM education. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

In particular, the scientific community is proposing millions of scientific software prototypes to enable reproducibility of research results in almost every domain. Scientists may frequently introduce security and quality issues into existing scientific software via their code changes due to their limited experience in software quality and security and the lack of tools for quality and security assessments that can be easily used and integrated in programming environments. Thus, several existing scientific software projects are difficult to 1) extend by scientists due to their poor quality and 2) deploy by industry due to the likelihood of security vulnerabilities and the bad development practices used. Without a unified and easy-to-integrate framework for detecting, fixing, and documenting vulnerability and quality issues in scientific projects, the reusability, extendibility, safe deployment, and technology transfer of scientific projects will remain limited. This project builds a sustainable, community-driven software security and quality analysis framework. These tools enable more scientists to build better software and to transfer their prototypes to industry by following the best software development practices. Its integrated education plan will bring undergraduate and graduate computer science students more awareness and expertise in the evolution of software systems, including security and quality issues.<br/><br/>This project develops a framework for detecting, fixing, and documenting security and quality issues. It will continuously monitor the software repository to identify security vulnerabilities and quality issues based on static and dynamic analyses, and then find the best sequence of code changes to prioritize and fix them. The developers can review the recommendations and their impacts in a detailed report and select the code changes that they want to apply. The framework includes a visualization support of the quality and security changes over the evolution of the project. Furthermore, non-expert programmers from the scientific community can use the automatically generated documentation by the framework to understand the severity of the detected issues and necessary code changes to fix them. The project has the potential to revolutionize how developers monitor the evolution of their systems in continuous integration environments by unifying security and quality issues detection and correction and enabling their automated documentation. All tools and methodologies will be empirically evaluated in collaboration with scientists from various domains.

LIB fires have captured the headlines several times in recent years including ~25,000 fire incidents in more than 400 consumer products between 2012 and 2017. Current battery safety mechanisms contribute to 5 ? 10% of the overall battery cost but are ineffective as evidenced by the continued occurrence of LIB fires.

Furthermore, it can be engineered into an easy-to-use system for a wide range of scientists and healthcare professionals. <br/><br/>The proposed project aims to develop a versatile and cost-effective library construction technology that enables protein translation monitoring on a variety of biological samples. High throughput sequencing of RNA molecules requires the preparation of libraries.

However, ligation of adaptors is time-consuming and low-efficiency, and the resulting cDNA libraries are contaminated with cross- and self-ligation adaptor byproducts and require additional purification steps. The proposed technology relies on a novel enzyme system capable of 5? adenylation and 3? polyadenylation of RNA fragments. To increase the efficiency of RNA adenylation at both ends, a fusion enzyme with high enzymatic efficiency is engineered. Moreover, to reduce ligation time and increase efficiency, pre-orientated oligonucleotide adaptors will be specially designed.

They foul and corrode infrastructure and cause chronic infections. At present, approaches to making surfaces that prevent infection have met with only limited success.  The goal of this project is to determine how bacteria sense the mechanics of the surface upon attachment and respond to surface mechanics by starting to develop a biofilm.  This work will establish basic knowledge that can be used to design surfaces that resist the development of biofilms by not giving bacteria the mechanical cue(s) needed to start forming a biofilm.  Thus, the scientific aims will improve biofilm prevention and thereby benefit public health and infrastructure such as water treatment, shipping, and oil transport.  Mentoring and education in ethics and mindset will improve the undergraduate environment and pipeline for STEM majors.  A study of classroom education methods will improve undergraduate STEM education. <br/><br/>The research objective of this project is to develop a predictive framework for understanding how bacteria use proteins in their cell envelopes to sense and respond to the mechanics of the surface to which they attach. The working hypothesis is that bacteria do this by transducing stresses and deformations in their envelopes that depend on the elasticity of both the bacterium and the substrate as well as the energy of adhesion with the surface. This study will extend studies of P. aeruginosa and generalize to include another rod-shaped Gram-negative bacterium (Escherichia coli), a rod-shaped Gram-positive bacterium (Bacillus subtilis), and a spherical Gram-positive bacterium (Staphylococcus aureus).  Atomic force microscopy (AFM) will be used to measure the adhesion forces between bacteria and a wide range of test substrates with different surface chemistries and elasticities; AFM will also characterize the elasticity and topography of substrates. High-throughput culturing in well plates will be used to measure bacterial accumulation and growth on substrates, as well as the increase in antibiotic resistance that is a biofilm phenotype.  Finite-element modeling will characterize the stresses and deformations that arise when different types of bacteria attach to different substrates.  Trends shown by modeling will be validated by measuring the activity of mechanosensitive ion channels that are more open when the membrane stress is greater. Quantitative confocal microscopy and image analysis will measure the intracellular signaling that arises as a result of bacteria attaching to surfaces and the intercellular signaling that arises as a result of bacterial growth on the surface. Genetic manipulation (reporter strains and isogenic knockouts) will be used to measure signaling and to elucidate the role of specific gene products, such as candidate mechanosensory proteins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thermosets are advanced polymers that can be reinforced with high-strength fibers to create lightweight composite materials with complex architectures. Their manufacturing process involves chemical curing reactions, heat generation, and heat conduction that result in a change of phase from a liquid polymer mixture to a cross-linked solid structure. Stresses built up during the process can cause very small cracks to be formed, which can contribute to subsequent failures in the structure. Extensive curing-induced microcracking is a key technological challenge in the production of critical structural components for space exploration, wind energy production, and current and future transportation. The manufacturability of the next generation of high-performance, lightweight structures depends upon fabricating damage-free complex composites with enhanced mechanical properties. This award supports fundamental computational and experimental research to provide the necessary knowledge for developing crack-free thermosets, optimizing composite performance, and reducing the time and cost to create better composite parts. This research program will be integrated with educational and outreach activities, including developing an e-learning platform with engaging learning activities, K12 summer programs, and internships that aim to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in research and positively impact engineering education. <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to reveal the fundamental mechanisms of curing-induced microcracking in thermoset composites. This project will establish process-property relationships to predict curing-induced damage mechanisms in thermosets across the micro and macro scales, which will enable new manufacturing capabilities. Knowledge generated from this research will allow manufacturers to tailor their processes to prevent curing-induced damage. This project will test the hypothesis that layer/layer and fiber/matrix property mismatches and resin shrinkage cause microcracking when the material is processed below its glass transition temperature and after gelation, depending on the resin viscosity and toughness. Advanced multiscale process modeling techniques that account for thermal gradients, resin exothermic reactions, mismatch in thermomechanical properties, shrinkage, and residual stresses will be implemented. A new time-independent characterization technique for determining material properties at intermediate degrees of cure based on off-stoichiometry polymer proxies will be tested. This novel approach to learning constitutive relations of thermosets during curing will be used to identify and quantify viscoelastic and viscoplastic resin properties during manufacturing. In-situ testing during curing will aim to validate the approach for three material systems, including 3D woven textiles, bonded adhesives, and thermosets for additive manufacturing. The planned result is an experimentally-validated physics-based multiscale process modeling framework to design and optimize enhanced composites which can help the composite industry by providing a missing link between material, manufacturing, and properties in order to prevent microcracking.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It reduces the environmental impacts and the associate health risk for human and wildlife that may be caused due to landfilling these batteries. If lithium-ion batteries are landfilled, society will encounter environmental issues such as land and water contaminations and fire and explosion of landfilled batteries. It also reduces the needs to extract rare elements such as lithium and cobalt from mines to save the mines for next generations. Lastly, it improves the United States? national security because recycling can keep the major elements or materials of lithium-ion batteries in the closed-loop of manufacturing in the country and reduces the dependency of the United States to import these elements or materials from other countries. This project will generate new jobs for labors and engineers in the United States and opens job opportunities for persons with disabilities since the process/machine can be automated. This work will increase the economic competitiveness of the United States compared to China and Europe, which are currently the pioneer in recycling lithium-ion batteries.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a recycling machine based on our two fundamental research activities, one for effective separation of electrode materials from current collectors, and one for efficient separation of anode and cathode active materials from each other. The key point is that the separations are performed without causing any damage to the morphology and composition of the anode and cathode active materials so that the separated materials can be directly regenerated and returned to the battery manufacturing process. This increases the profit from the obtained recycled materials from the proposed machine. These two key separation processes enable us to (1) offer a potentially small machine for recycling lithium-ion batteries, and (2) recycle all types of lithium-ion batteries with different chemistries and manufacturers with one machine.

A potentially important but understudied food resource for migratory waterbirds, juvenile fish, and diverse invertebrate predators are small sea slugs (genus Alderia), which can occur in dense aggregations of over 1,000 slugs per square meter on temperate mudflats throughout the Northern Hemisphere. We hypothesize that Alderia use a recently discovered branch of metabolism to make bad-tasting molecules termed polyketides, a family of compounds that include medically important drugs. We will characterize new polyketides from these abundant slugs, test how they repel predators, and then explore how they may affect many other aspects of the ecosystem. Potential effects of these slug compounds include changing the bacteria in the mud through antibiotic effects; repelling some animal species that live in the mud while attracting others; and causing the evolution of slug mimicry in palatable ?roly-polies? that co-occur on the mudflat. These studies will provide new insight into how energy moves through the food-chain in estuaries, and how one species can have unexpected effects on many surrounding species in its ecosystem. We will also study how climate change has altered the distribution of slug species (and hence their compounds) along the U.S. west coast, which may have cascading but previously unrecognized effects on the inhabitants of threatened estuaries. Finally, the project will support the collaboration between two primary undergraduate institutions, one of which is Hispanic serving and a large research institution, via the collaboration between the three school many undergraduate and master?s students will be supported each year by the project. The project will focus on the recruitment of students historically underrepresented in science to the proposed research and outreach activities. <br/><br/>We will test whether polyketide (PK) compounds produced by sea slugs function as keystone molecules, altering energy flow and community structure in Northern Hemisphere estuaries. Small sea slugs (Alderia) are exceptionally abundant (>1000/m2) on mudflats, representing a potential resource for diverse fish, bird and invertebrate consumers. We will characterize a biosynthetic pathway and novel PK metabolites produced by slugs, and determine if PKs protect Alderia from wetland predators using a combination of laboratory and field assays with extracts and pure compounds. We will then estimate the net loss of primary production to higher trophic levels due to this chemical defense. The rapid evolution of Batesian mimicry in introduced isopods along the U.S. west coast will be assessed in this system to understand how chemical defense and visual predation affect phenotypic evolution of co-occuring organisms over short timescales. Manipulative experiments will test the effects of PKs on the microbiome and infaunal community of mudflats to determine the impact of shed compounds on diverse ecological processes in this sensitive nursery habitat. These studies will address, from gene to ecosystem, the impacts of potential keystone compounds synthesized as an antipredator defense in a common temperate mollusc. Modeling studies will explore the basis for range limits and the effects of ongoing climate change on shifting range boundaries between two Alderia species. These results will collectively provide new insight into how global change may alter the distribution of keystone molecules and thus have unanticipated effects on communities in already-threatened habitats such as estuaries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Additive manufacturing opens revolutionary opportunities for fabricating complex geometries and lowering the cost of low-volume production. However, the impact has been restrained by the low toughness/ductility of AM polymer parts. This project is expected to substantially expand the impact of the existing AM manufacturing base for polymers. The geometric flexibility of low volume AM will enable new customized products. This can allow new opportunities such as increased customization of medical device components to individual patients. It will also be especially value in lowering the costs of maintaining out-of-production equipment and reduce supply chain challenges in distant locations.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a method to post-process parts from existing commercial processes to achieve dramatic property enhancements. The post-processing polymer powder bed fusion components increase ductility, isotropy, and toughness.

This project will fill this curricular gap and will develop, deliver, and evaluate a suite of sociotechnical cybersecurity learning modules.  These modules can then be used in standard computing curricula to create a cybersecurity proficient software workforce that can significantly enhance cybersecurity in the workplace.<br/><br/>The modules will be used in capstone courses at Informatics at the University of California, Irvine (UCI) and Indiana University (IU).  The researchers will utilize the modules to create an assessment for the most critical and essential cybersecurity knowledge and skills. The outcomes of the research will advance the understanding of how students could develop sociotechnical cybersecurity proficiency as a part of their capstone experience.  Since capstones are typically a graduation requirement, integrating cybersecurity learning within these courses will have the transformative effect of all students in the computing disciplines graduating with core cybersecurity knowledge.

The sharp difference in ice speed inside and outside of these drainage routes is comparable in magnitude to the speed difference between a race car and a pedestrian, begging the question how ice with relatively similar properties across the entirety of the ice sheet behaves so differently. The most convincing explanation to date is that rapidly moving ice has lost direct contact with the bedrock below and is slipping towards the ocean while slowly moving ice remains connected to the bed and is moving through internal deformation. Compelling as this explanation might be, it does not address where in the ice column the slip occurs that enables fast motion, but this location is essential for assessing how sliding, and the associated ice motion, responds to climate change. If slip occurs where ice and rock meet at the base of the ice sheet, water infiltration from a warming ocean could directly affect ice speed. If slip occurs close to the base of the ice sheet but within the ice itself, this feedback would likely be less immediate. The research plan is integrated with a collaborative educational program that aims to increase participation in polar science for high-school students from historically disadvantaged communities that are prone to be impacted by sea-level rise in the near future.<br/><br/>The goal of this CAREER proposal is to understand the possibility and implications of an internal shear band forming in ice flowing over rough topography by developing a suite of customized numerical models that will be available as open-source tools to the glaciological community for usage and further development. The team hypothesizes that ice flowing over a hard bed with rough topography in the non-cavitating limit may experience sufficient strain localization in the ice just above topographic highs to form an internal shear band through creep instability despite advective cooling as the ice thins and accelerates. The deformation in this internal shear band is highly localized and reminiscent of sliding, highlighting that flow and sliding may be end members that are connected by a spectrum of increasingly localized englacial deformation. The team will test its hypothesis through a three-step process by (1) identifying the nondimensional conditions that are required for internal-shear band formation for a bed with an idealized topography, (2) generalizing insights to beds with more realistic, fractal bed topography and comparing results to existing field observations, and (3) producing continental-scale assessments of where an internal shear band could form for both Greenland and Antarctica.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast, humans constantly decide ""what to see"" and ""how to see it"" using active exploration. This ability is central to problem-solving and adaptability to novel scenarios but remains missing from robots today. To bridge this gap, this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project aims to study a self-improving robot perception system using manipulation skills ? referred to as active scene understanding. The framework suggested in this project improves a robot's fundamental capabilities in perception and planning and therefore impacts many application domains such as service robots or field exploration, where robots need to rapidly analyze their environments in order to swiftly react to evolving situations. The research and education plans are integrated through a Cloud-Enabled Robot Learning Platform, which allows students to participate in robotics education and research without the limits of robot and compute hardware accessibility.<br/><br/>This project tackles a number of challenges in active scene understanding to achieve a unified and practical framework. The key idea of the approach is to leverage the synergies between a robot's perception and interaction algorithms to create self-supervisory signals. On the one hand, the robot can use its own actions and the corresponding action effects (i.e., visual observation of subsequent states) as ground truth labels for training its visual predictive model. On the other hand, the robot can also use the statistics provided by the perception model (e.g., uncertainty, novelty, and predictability) as a reward signal to improve its manipulation policy. Ultimately, the robot could combine the learned visual predictive model and manipulation policy to facilitate efficient action planning for downstream tasks.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Permafrost occurs under approximately one fourth of the northern hemisphere's land surface and contains as much carbon (stored as undecomposed organic material) as the entire atmosphere. When permafrost thaws, microorganisms (such as fungi and bacteria) decompose and convert this organic material to carbon dioxide and methane, two of the most important greenhouse gases in our atmosphere. This mechanism is referred to as positive climate feedback because the warming of permafrost generates higher concentrations of carbon dioxide and methane in the atmosphere which increases atmospheric temperatures even further. This permafrost?climate feedback is one of the least well-understood global climate feedbacks, partially due to our lack of understanding of permafrost microbial communities. There is limited data about how permafrost thaw affects the microbial community?or microbiome?including the ecological processes underpinning the composition of the microbial community after permafrost thaws. New evidence shows that microbial communities are not only shaped by the environment in which they live, but that random chance?or coincidence?also determines which microbes are present at any given time. The degree of coincidence influences our ability to predict microbiomes and their functions. The proposed work will deepen the understanding of the ecological processes that are shaping the post-thaw composition and activity of soil microorganisms. At the same time this project will train the next generation of polar researchers (at the postdoctoral, graduate, and undergraduate levels) and build a network of permafrost microbiologists able to address questions about the role of microorganisms in the permafrost?climate feedback. <br/><br/>The proposed work will improve understanding of the poorly known dynamics of post-thaw microbiomes in permafrost landscapes, which are rapidly changing due to the amplification of Arctic climate warming.

Specifically, this project will (1) synthesize publicly available and as-yet-unpublished DNA sequence data on post-thaw microbiomes from permafrost across the globe; (2) use ecological modeling to assess the contribution of stochasticity to the post-thaw microbiome composition over space, time, and disturbance intensity using a field sampling approach; (3) test mechanisms of assembly in post-thaw microbiomes in highly controlled laboratory incubations performed across many ecological axes; (4) equip the next generation of Arctic scholars and/or natural resource managers with the skills necessary to excel in scientific research, networking and collaboration, and science communication by training a postdoctoral researcher, a PhD student, and undergraduate and graduate students; (5) develop a professional network of permafrost microbial ecologists to elucidate the complex unknowns of permafrost and post-thaw microbiomes; and (6) support efforts to continue work in making polar and biogeosciences more diverse and inclusive.

As a revolutionary technology, additive manufacturing significantly improves logistics, quickly enables new products and increases material readiness, critical to bringing manufacturing back to the U.S. However, there are many challenges to 3D printing. For example, one significant difficulty stemming from most 3D printing principles is precisely controlling structural orders (e.g., patterned dots, lines, pillars) when manufacturing multiple materials at small scales (e.g., nanomanufacturing in the semiconductor industry). This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) award will support the research needed to develop a new additive manufacturing method that can precisely process a diversity of materials. The new manufacturing platform will enable layer-by-layer nanomaterial deposition at desired locations with optional polymers or nanoparticles. The multidisciplinary study includes research in polymer science, nanoparticle synthesis, and interfacial engineering. As a result, the newly-enabled composites could have broad applications in sensors, actuators, soft robotics, supercapacitors, batteries, and regenerative medicine. By involving female and underrepresented minority students in teaching, research, and international collaborations, this project will enhance their education and their representation in an important workforce.<br/><br/>Current 3D printing methods rely heavily on external fields (e.g., electrical, magnetic, and acoustic assistance) to precisely place nanoparticles at desired locations and control their long-range orders. However, these 3D printing platforms mandate nanoparticles to be field-interactive, and they have manufacturing limitations when highly concentrated nanoparticles form agglomerations in colloids. This research will advance fundamental knowledge of a new 3D printing method, Multiphase Direct Ink Writing (MDIW), to improve additive manufacturing precision and efficiency. MDIW will enable the deposition of submicron-scale structures without the constraints on part size and build speeds that are typically present in nanoscale additive manufacturing. In addition, this research involves studying the fundamentals of polymer science and nanoparticle engineering to generate new knowledge concerning a 3D printing method for directed nanoparticle assembly. Specifically, the research team will develop a new nanomanufacturing mechanism with layering capabilities, synthesize nanoparticles of controlled dimensions and with desired surface features, and form patterned surfaces with desired profiles by manipulating polymer-nanoparticle interactions to create submicron hierarchical structures.

Such robots are promising?particularly for navigation through sensitive and constrained environments?because they enable a workflow like using manual tools and can combine the benefits of direct human operation with the precision and dexterity of robotic control. However, the complex kinematics of continuum robots, along with the direct physical coupling of the human and robot, pose challenges for how to enable precise and intuitive control for operators. This project will investigate how different human-continuum robot interaction methods affect task performance, and insights will help guide the creation of new human-in-the-loop control methods and continuum robot designs. The outcomes of this project have potential for significant societal impact by transforming task performance in several industries, including healthcare, inspection, and manufacturing. This project will also support an extensive education and outreach plan that includes the development of a new hand-held haptic device along with related hands-on lab activities designed to promote problem-based learning that will be used in both undergraduate and graduate courses, as well as in a series of workshops for local middle school students to increase exposure and excitement for STEM.<br/><br/>The objective of this project is to determine how different human-continuum robot interaction methods affect task performance and to test these approaches in the context of a hand-held concentric tube robot and a hand-held, steerable vine robot. To achieve this objective, the research will proceed with three main aims. The first aim focuses on developing methods for estimating and interpreting user intent to achieve seamless integration of manual and teleoperated input, as well as quantifying the effects of this integration on task performance. The second aim focuses on improving robotic tool embodiment through automating the control of the robot shape and through incorporating haptic feedback. Finally, the third aim centers on evaluating the extent to which the principles of human-continuum robot interaction learned through the first two aims hold across multiple robot platforms. For this purpose, a new hand-held, steerable vine robot will be created and used for testing the applicability of the new methods. Overall, this research will help advance the fields of flexible and soft robotics and human-robot interaction, enabling intuitive deployment of robots with shapes that can be controlled for safe and effective completion of tasks in constrained environments. <br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many cases, the musculoskeletal system handles these obstacles by itself, independent of control by the nervous system, but the exact mechanisms by which this occurs are not thoroughly understood. The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate how specific features within the musculoskeletal system achieve the appropriate locomotor behaviors without needing reflex interventions from the nervous system. To achieve this objective, the researchers will study bipedal hopping by kangaroo rats within the context of abrupt changes in slope that can disrupt forward velocity and/or cause unwanted rotational pitch of the body. Novel experiments using a specially designed rotational treadmill will make it possible to expose kangaroo rats to controlled perturbations that mimic ecologically relevant obstacles. The conceptual framework of the studies is that the components of the musculoskeletal system represent an embedded intelligence that can ease the computational burden of centralized controllers for complex dynamic systems. We advance this idea by investigating specific examples in which specialized properties link functional demands, conditional properties, and system state. Translation of the findings can solve long-standing challenges for robots moving stably over variable terrains. Furthermore, the project will involve local high school teachers, who will develop, test, implement, and assess teaching modules based upon the ongoing research to encourage pre-college students to appreciate how the study of basic biology and engineering applications are complementary. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to elucidate how nonlinearities within the musculoskeletal system express contextually appropriate system properties to achieve desired motor function without needing neural feedback. The approach is to study bipedal hopping by kangaroo rats with abrupt changes in slope that can disrupt forward velocity and/or cause unwanted pitch. More specifically, the research will examine how the actions of ankle extensors are coupled to the mechanics of the feet, and how this coupling is modulated by the nonlinear features of tendon. This coupling is hypothesized to provide the functional benefit of automatically making the foot compliant upon landing to mediate perturbations and then stiff at takeoff to enable propulsion. To test this hypothesis, the research team will use an integrated framework of in vivo, in situ, and in silico methods to obtain behavioral data, test mechanistic hypotheses, and manipulate component properties, respectively. A novel custom-designed rotational treadmill will make it possible to have controlled perturbations that mimic ecologically relevant obstacles. More generally, nonlinearities expressed by a system?s components can expand a system?s range of operating conditions and contexts. The findings will provide guidance for the design of nonlinearities, namely, their type and parameterization, so that the nonlinearities will be advantageous for achieving function while interacting with unpredictable environments. By collaborating with local high school teachers, the PIs will build a network of STEM teachers who will develop, test, implement, and assess teaching modules based upon the research. In addition, the project will provide interdisciplinary research training and mentoring for two graduate students and one postdoctoral fellow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The prototype instrument uses THz reflective imaging phenomenology, a technique that has been shown to efficiently discriminate between healthy and diseased tissues. With a resolution of more than 300x300 pixels, operation at between 10-30 frames per second, and a compact form factor, the system is appropriate for medical environments such as cancer surgeries, including glioblastoma resection.  The THz camera will be a new addition to the medical imaging market that has matured with x-ray, MRI, visible and infrared technologies to reach $45 billion. This new instrument is enabled by a large format sensor array that uses a low-cost manufacturing process already implemented in a high-volume foundry. In addition to the medical application, similar imaging systems can be used in security screening applications ($2 billion market/year) such as passenger screening at airports.  More broadly, the underlying sensor technology can be adapted for use across the extremely wide THz spectrum, which has implications for many industries.   <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is primarily its integration of both high resolution and high-speed aspects of THz imaging, as these capabilities have not yet been demonstrated in a commercially viable form. Previous demonstrations have either involved slow scanning systems that preclude real time applications or cameras that target much higher bands of the THz spectrum. The latter restriction stems from an inability to manufacture arrays of large pixels to image at the longer THz wavelengths.  Going beyond one of a kind laboratory proof of concept experiments, the THz camera seeks to provide resolution and frame update rates that are relevant to actual applications. The commercial manufacturing viability of the sensing element may ensure that applications beyond the initial medical market will be practical.  The camera will feature not only the high-resolution THz imaging near the 250-350 GHz spectrum but also incorporate high-resolution visible and near-infrared cameras that can complement the THz video, with trials being planned for hospital usage.  In addition to clinical usage scenarios, the imaging system can be adapted for use in airport security and other screening applications, as portability and ease of use will guide the demonstration system design.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Warfare and violence between civilizations of diverse religious and cultural backgrounds continue to shape the societies immersed in these antagonistic interactions. By looking to the past, archaeology has the ability to reveal complex examples of ancient aggression, giving insight into the long-term effects of large-scale and endemic violence on human societies. While it would be easy to focus on the negative aspects of warfare, which are prevalent and varied, there are also contexts in which warfare has acted as a stimulus for cultural florescence. The present project builds upon the sensational discovery of multi thousand new ancient Maya structures in the Guatemalan jungle, detected by laser-based, lidar remote sensing technology, to investigate just such a case. The multi-layered conflicts seen between Maya city-states, as well as contemporary foreign cultures, are reminiscent of the complex conflicts that affect different areas of the globe today, and archaeology can inform upon the long-term societal impacts caused by these clashes.<br/><br/>Dr. Garrison and his team will focus their investigations on the newly discovered, ancient fortress of La Cuernavilla. Situated between the great Maya city-state of Tikal and the smaller neighboring kingdom of El Zotz, the fortress appears to date to the late 4th century; the very beginnings of Classic Maya civilization (AD 300-900). Preliminary studies indicate a link between La Cuernavilla and the foreign, central Mexican city of Teotihuacan, which invaded and conquered Tikal in AD 378. Using a combination of archaeological, environmental, and chemical analyses the researchers will conduct field and laboratory investigations to unpack the complex cultural milieu present at La Cuernavilla and in its surrounding landscape. Studies of local environmental conditions in the past, as well as available ancient dietary resources will show to what degree the site was a true fortress, able to withstand long-term attacks and advance a political and military agenda. Archaeological investigations will discern the complex cultural sequence that involves two Maya cities at war during the time of a foreign occupation. These analyses and comparisons with other case studies will be used to interpret to what degree places like La Cuernavilla contributed to the rise of cultural complexity and the florescence of Maya civilization, hopefully serving as a model for understanding similar situations across time and space.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is expected that local mechanical loading from habitual activity will mediate both mineral loss and bone wall changes, which should be observable in comparisons of bone cross-sectional images between different bones. This doctoral dissertation project seeks to establish whether age-related changes in bone mineral density (BMD) and bone wall geometry co-occur locally within limb long bone cross-sections among living adults between 40-80 years of age. A localized relationship would suggest that geometric adaptation of bone to loading persists into advanced age despite overall loss of bone mass, which has implications for the interpretation of aging from archaeological contexts as well as for prevention of age-related fragility fractures. The project supports undergraduate and graduate training and research opportunities in STEM. In addition to scholarly dissemination of results in the form of conference presentations and journal publications, this research will be presented to project participants, as well as at public research forums, community centers, and other accessible settings. <br/><br/>Age-related bone loss has been attributed to a host of interrelated systemic factors (e.g., hormone decline, loss of muscle strength) and is thereby treated as a global process throughout the body. With age, bone wall diameters expand and become thinner through the removal of bone from the internal surface and addition on the external surface. The resulting expansion of bone cross-sectional diameter bolsters resistance to bending under mechanical loads and, due to roughly concurrent timing with BMD decline, has been characterized as compensatory to bone loss. Earlier in life, bone wall geometry and microstructure adapt to mechanical loading. If this ability to adapt extends into late adulthood, it is possible that age-related wall expansion and BMD decline vary locally according to typical loading patterns within a bone cross-section, along the length of a bone, and between bone elements. If, in addition to local variation, results indicate that these processes exhibit local covariation, this research can provide further support to the compensatory relationship between the expansion of bone walls and BMD decline.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

STEM students achieve transfer success; (2) expand the definition of transfer pathway success by collectively identifying a set of student socialization outcomes (such as sense of belonging) and corresponding validated instruments that participants can use to measure success; and, (3) evaluate the effectiveness of a transfer support structure at each participating campus by implementing the institutional data analysis plan and testing the survey instrument.  Each CRC will consist of a two-year college and a neighboring four-year university, resulting in partnerships that are beneficial for students at both institutions and the establishment of relationships that extend beyond the conference. CRCs will include STEM faculty, campus administrators, institutional research staff, and individuals involved in transfer student programming. This broad representation will ensure that CRCs include the necessary stakeholders to take advantage of project findings.

Recently, with the growing interest in active mobility and walkability, several cities are experimenting with various technologies to sense people. Pedestrian traffic estimation, which has been mostly based on video data analysis or infrared sensors, can be scaled up if microphone-based sensors are deemed equally effective. Acoustic sensor technology, while starting to be deployed for noise pollution measurement and the classification of urban noise sources, has not been explored in the pedestrian sensing context despite its considerable advantages in cost and power requirements. The main reason for the current underutilization of microphone-based sensors is the challenging task of analyzing the audio signal from a multitude of different sources. To address this hitherto unsolved challenge, technology developed for highly complex music audio signals will be adapted to the urban sensing context. Furthermore, a novel dataset comprising audio recordings with pedestrian count annotations will be curated and released to facilitate future research in this area. The project will also demonstrate how the data extracted from audio sensing can be used for pedestrian flow estimation in a small urban area.<br/><br/>The project will experiment with a range of off-the-shelf hardware components in a pedestrian-heavy campus environment to investigate how far audio technology can be pushed to sense people, and to assess the possibilities for scalability. As the problem is particularly challenging due to high noise level and potentially low-level pedestrian sound, we speculate that state-of-the-art approaches in audio classification might not be powerful enough to solve the problem of pedestrian count estimation sufficiently well. Inspired by recent work with structured music representations learned through multi-task learning and supervised latent space regularization, a novel experimental regularization approach to representation learning for audio data is applied. This self-supervised learning approach to regularization supports structuring the latent space representation based on feature distances. The additional regularization loss term is derived from the distances of powerful task-relevant pre-trained features in current audio representation structures. This loss, computed for each pair of training data points, can be computed without data annotations as it is based solely on the feature distances between training data points. It enables implicitly imparting domain knowledge through the regularizing feature and thus improves the inductive bias of the network.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Emissions from global plastics production and incineration could reach 56 billion tons of carbon between now and 2050, accounting for 15% of global greenhouse gas emissions. The economics of conventional plastic recycling are poor, because the high temperatures used in recycling cause quality degradation that greatly reduces the economic value.

Simultaneously, New Guinea suffers from high rates of deforestation; from 1972 - 2002, 24% of the eastern half of the island's forests were cleared or degraded through logging. This means that there are many threatened organisms that we know little about. Although not as popular with humans as animals like birds of paradise, snakes are important to the ecology of the island, with many snakes being top predators that have large impacts on the ecosystem. Snakes also provide lesser known but important benefits to humans, such as medical drugs made from venoms. Despite the importance of snakes in the island ecosystem, the majority of New Guinean species remain poorly studied and there are likely many species not yet described. This project focuses on two of the most poorly studied groups of snakes in New Guinea, the groundsnakes and the keelbacks. Scientific efforts for this project include expeditions to New Guinea to find these snakes, gather genetic and morphological data, and use this information to identify new species, determine how the species are related to each other, and place these species in the broader context of snake relationships, ultimately resulting in novel contributions to the assessment of New Guinean biodiversity. This work also provides new scientific training to the senior scientists conducting the study and to undergraduates and graduate students from both the United States and New Guinea. Resulting publications will be open-access and online wiki pages will be created for each new species discovered with the help of undergraduate students funded by this work; all results can thus be accessed by scientists, educators, and the global public alike. The senior scientists will also use both their associated museum and university platforms to publicly present results at all educational levels, from children to adults. This interweaving of science and education will train effective scientists, contribute to public knowledge, and foster international relations.<br/>	The alpha taxonomy of New Guinean snakes is poorly known and multiple lines of evidence suggest substantial undescribed diversity (only ca. 75% of species are currently recognized). Furthermore, few or none of the species from the focal genera have been included in published molecular phylogenies and thus are essentially unknowns in modern systematic studies. This project has four fundamental objectives: (1) Conduct fieldwork in Papua New Guinea, as well as in Indonesia and the Philippines, to complement current sampling for groundsnakes (Stegonotus) and keelbacks (Tropidonophis) for use in high-throughput DNA sequencing efforts (target capture) and contemporary morphological data collection by generating high-resolution CT scans and including contrast-enhanced scans stained with diffusible iodine. (2) Use museum specimens to fill in sampling gaps when fresh tissues are unobtainable using a recently published protocol for sequencing of fluid-preserved specimens. (3) Describe new species and the intrageneric relationships from the focal genera in a revisionary monograph based on a combination of molecular and morphological data. (4) Train the next generation of taxonomists and simultaneously expand the tool kit for both the principal investigators and for U.S. and Papua New Guinea undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It holds great promise to expand or accelerate their applications in many areas, especially for fast-charging electric vehicles to replace internal combustion engine vehicles, as well as stabilizing energy storage from renewable energy sources that are inherently intermittent such as wind and wave energy. However, common energy storage devices, such as batteries, have exhibited severe degradation under fast charging conditions. This Career project is to develop a practical method to develop fast-charging energy storage devices by introducing an internal electric field in the electrode to improve the electrode kinetics and the device performance. The project will host Bootcamp to train rural middle and high school teachers in developing science curricula, equipping them to deliver enriching classroom activities and lectures. Moreover, the project will involve underrepresented students performing science and engineering related projects, especially Native Americans, women, and first-generation college students.<br/><br/><br/>The research objective of this Career project aims to develop a novel heterostructure in the electrode to improve the fast-charging capability of energy storage devices by more than 10 times compared with state-of-the-art research studies. Based on the preliminary studies, the central hypothesis is that an internal electric field, generated on the heterointerfaces can accelerate ion transport, enhance electrode kinetics by lowering the energy of activation, and hence improve the performance under fast-charging conditions. It is expected to address this challenge and fundamentally advance the correlation between the electric field of the heterostructure, and the resulting fast-charging performance at the energy storage device level. The major contributions to those multidisciplinary fields lie in several aspects. First, a fundamental understanding will be generated on the effect of the local electric field of the heterostructure on the diffusion coefficient and electrode kinetics. A simulation model will also be created to be integrated with experimental efforts. Second, a knowledge gap will be filled from the material properties of the electrode to the fast-charging functionality of the devices. Third, distinct from conventional nanostructure engineering approaches in state-of-the-art research studies, which have a complex and high-cost fabrication process, introducing a heterostructure in the electrode provides an effective, safe, facile, and transformative approach that remarkably enhances the charge transfer and holds great promise to resolve one of the biggest issues, ?long charging time,? of existing energy storage devices. The fundamental study will also open a new door to resolving issues in other energy devices by modulating the electronic structures in the devices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A potentially important but understudied food resource for migratory waterbirds, juvenile fish, and diverse invertebrate predators are small sea slugs (genus Alderia), which can occur in dense aggregations of over 1,000 slugs per square meter on temperate mudflats throughout the Northern Hemisphere. We hypothesize that Alderia use a recently discovered branch of metabolism to make bad-tasting molecules termed polyketides, a family of compounds that include medically important drugs. We will characterize new polyketides from these abundant slugs, test how they repel predators, and then explore how they may affect many other aspects of the ecosystem. Potential effects of these slug compounds include changing the bacteria in the mud through antibiotic effects; repelling some animal species that live in the mud while attracting others; and causing the evolution of slug mimicry in palatable ?roly-polies? that co-occur on the mudflat. These studies will provide new insight into how energy moves through the food-chain in estuaries, and how one species can have unexpected effects on many surrounding species in its ecosystem. We will also study how climate change has altered the distribution of slug species (and hence their compounds) along the U.S. west coast, which may have cascading but previously unrecognized effects on the inhabitants of threatened estuaries. Finally, the project will support the collaboration between two primary undergraduate institutions, one of which is Hispanic serving and a large research institution, via the collaboration between the three school many undergraduate and master?s students will be supported each year by the project. The project will focus on the recruitment of students historically underrepresented in science to the proposed research and outreach activities. <br/><br/>We will test whether polyketide (PK) compounds produced by sea slugs function as keystone molecules, altering energy flow and community structure in Northern Hemisphere estuaries. Small sea slugs (Alderia) are exceptionally abundant (>1000/m2) on mudflats, representing a potential resource for diverse fish, bird and invertebrate consumers. We will characterize a biosynthetic pathway and novel PK metabolites produced by slugs, and determine if PKs protect Alderia from wetland predators using a combination of laboratory and field assays with extracts and pure compounds. We will then estimate the net loss of primary production to higher trophic levels due to this chemical defense. The rapid evolution of Batesian mimicry in introduced isopods along the U.S. west coast will be assessed in this system to understand how chemical defense and visual predation affect phenotypic evolution of co-occuring organisms over short timescales. Manipulative experiments will test the effects of PKs on the microbiome and infaunal community of mudflats to determine the impact of shed compounds on diverse ecological processes in this sensitive nursery habitat. These studies will address, from gene to ecosystem, the impacts of potential keystone compounds synthesized as an antipredator defense in a common temperate mollusc. Modeling studies will explore the basis for range limits and the effects of ongoing climate change on shifting range boundaries between two Alderia species. These results will collectively provide new insight into how global change may alter the distribution of keystone molecules and thus have unanticipated effects on communities in already-threatened habitats such as estuaries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The rapidly increasing computational power and data storage capabilities of these interconnected devices allow the development of decentralized, privacy-preserving analytics tools that can enhance fairness, privacy, cost-effectiveness and reduced computational burden through parallelization, standing in contrast to the prevalent paradigm of collecting and processing data in centralized data centers in the cloud. The accompanying educational plan supports community-level involvement in emerging technologies, helping to prepare future engineers to interact with and develop IoFT technologies. This is achieved through an outreach program oriented towards the American public and middle-school students in the greater-Detroit communities underrepresented in STEM fields and on college campuses.<br/><br/>This research will build a data-driven, decentralized analytics framework for the IoFT capable of providing customized decision-making and control at the individual device level. A predictive framework allows devices to retain their local data-driven models while leveraging results and data from similar, though non-identical, devices. A key feature of the predictive framework is its ability to account for data heterogeneity, as devices are often operated under different operating and environmental conditions. Bayesian theory and distributed inference are then adopted to enable decentralized uncertainty quantification for the predictive models at the individual device level. The predictions are then used in an optimization framework to realize target output at the individual device level by optimizing controllable system input. The techniques developed will be evaluated using an IoFT prototype for distributed 3D printing, and will provide public data for other researchers to further investigate IoFT within manufacturing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many historic masonry structures are presently excluded in recent versions of tornadic building code requirements. The detailed textual and image data collected during this research will contribute to understanding the relationship between masonry construction types and building damage during tornadoes, can help communities to better prepare for and be resilient from natural hazard events, and can inform future building code requirements. Data collected from this award will be archived in the National Science Foundation (NSF)-supported Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-CI.org).  This award will contribute to the NSF role in the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP). <br/><br/>The focus of this research is 1) to evaluate the efficacy of retrofit and adaptively reused masonry structures, 2) to elucidate potential weaknesses in other historic structures across the United States, and 3) to identify resilient masonry connection typologies for future retrofits and additions. This research will provide new knowledge and data concerning certain types of masonry structures (Risk Categories 1 and 2) during tornadic loading. This knowledge can lead to improving the performance of historic masonry structures, as many historic masonry structures are not addressed in recent additions to tornadic building design criteria (American Society of Civil Engineers 7-22, Minimum Design Loads and Associated Criteria for Buildings and Other Structures). The field reconnaissance will generate a unique data set that will include ground-based and drone-based photos and ground-based detailed structural surveys focusing specifically on connection typologies due to retrofitting or building additions.

Large fractions of low-skilled workers are underemployed, while many of the highly skilled are unemployed and waiting for jobs. This labor market dysfunction is puzzling to economists who have study how workers shift from low productivity agriculture to higher productivity non-farm sectors during the process of economic development.

The proposed technology uses artificial intelligence (AI) to analyze images of cells for signs of virus. This can be done within hours of infection instead of days, which can greatly accelerate the development of vaccines and antiviral drugs.

The broader impact of our technology beyond the development of novel therapeutics is the change in paradigm our drug discovery platform will cause. If our method is successful in discovering compounds with high clinical efficacy, many drug developers will switch from cell lines to using clinically relevant primary cell cultures, resulting in an increase in the value of our technology as it will be needed during the active patent window to conduct screenings in adult neural cells.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a novel screening system, the first of its kind, to test compounds directly in adult neural cells. Current neural screens use embryonic or newborn neural cells which leads to a very high clinical failure rate as those cells do not represent the target adult neural population in those with neurological diseases and disorders. The proposed novel screening system can consistently provide 10s of millions of neural cells of high purity and viability to conduct drug screenings directly in adult neural cells in place of embryonic/newborn neural cells.

Tribology is the science of friction and wear at the sliding contacts. Research and engineering efforts in tribology address the physical and chemical mechanisms underlying friction and wear, and aim to design materials, processes, and devices such that new solutions to technological challenges become available. Advances in tribology help to reduce energy consumption by lowering friction, to prolong the lifetime and enhance the safety of mechanical systems by reducing wear, and to decrease harmful emissions in applications from vehicles to manufacturing through reduction of energy use. Tribology also impacts the life of humans and animals that move on earth. The Gordon Research Conference (GRC) on Tribology is a forum to exchange results of cutting-edge research amongst an interdisciplinary group of scientists and engineers who are at the forefront of addressing fundamental and applied challenges in this field. This award will promote participations of students and early-career researchers from diverse backgrounds at the GRC. <br/><br/>This subtitle ?Understanding Sliding Interfaces to Master Tribological Systems Across Length Scales? reflects the fact a comprehensive understanding of tribological phenomena requires multidisciplinary knowledge encompassing a range of classical fields in science and engineering, including chemistry, physics, mechanical engineering, and materials science over multiple length scales. Most tribologists are trained in one of these areas with emphasis on either microscale (atomic, molecular, nano) or macroscale (system-level) phenomena or methodologies and then exposed to other fields or scales of tribology as they make transitions from schools to real-world situations. Realizing the multidisciplinary and multiscale challenges in tribology is believed that the next significant breakthroughs are likely to be found at the interfaces between the classical trainings. To achieve these breakthroughs, the very diverse tribology community needs to come together to learn and discover together. The 2022 GRC will provide a venue for this discussion and learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It will examine how feelings of regret and blame shape human behavior in situations where people interact strategically so that each person?s welfare also depends on the actions of others. It poses that people regret their actions when they feel responsible for a bad outcome. On the other hand, they blame other people when they believe them to be responsible for the bad outcome. This project will examine how this tension between regret and blame affects behavior and economic outcomes. The project will (i) emphasize the importance of accounting for emotions in economic models, (ii) enhance our understanding of environments where reduced cooperation and inefficient outcomes may arise due to division of responsibility, and (iii) produce a previously nonexistent type of data that other researchers in economics and psychology can use.<br/><br/>This proposed work will examine regret in games. It will propose a theory where strategically-interacting agents make choices taking into account both material payoffs and the regret that their choices may generate. This theory accounts for how the magnitude of a player?s (anticipated) regret (for her action in a game and her resulting payoff) is affected by the division of responsibility between the players for the outcome of the game. This is the first work to consider a strategic form of regret, since earlier works have analyzed regret as if in a single-agent context with the opponents? actions treated as the state of the world. The intuition is as follows. In a decision-theoretic context an outcome is exclusively a result of the decision-maker?s (DM) choice and ?luck? (the at first unknown state of the world). Feelings of regret can naturally arise given the power the DM has over the outcome. On the other hand, the outcome of a game is the result of the strategic interaction of multiple agents. Thus, it is postulated that a player may not (expect to) experience feelings of regret to the same degree, as she may feel less responsible for the combined result of all the players? actions. Specifically, it is posed that a player?s regret tends to arise when her chosen action is proven sub-optimal after the other players? actions are revealed. However, her regret is mitigated if it is also revealed that the other players could have chosen differently (making everyone better off), as part of the blame is attributed to them. The project will examine both theoretically and experimentally how such regret and blame considerations affect economic outcomes and whether accounting for these consideration leads to theoretical predictions closer to experimental findings. The project will have three main benefits. First, it will contribute to our understanding of the circumstances under which attribution of responsibility and blame can affect outcomes of strategic interactions. It will also help us understand whether this effect will be welfare enhancing or damaging, and gauge the magnitude of the effect. Second, it will inform theoretical work by emphasizing the gains from modifications to models of choice when those are applied in games. Last, it will produce experimental data on regret and blame in games that other researchers can use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, to realize the envisioned latency breakthrough of edge computing and put this new paradigm into operation, a critical piece that is still missing is algorithms that orchestrate the data and the computation to guarantee ultra-low latency. The overall objective of this CAREER proposal is to fill this gap by developing (i) orchestration algorithms that dynamically coordinate data and computation for edge computing systems to meet stringent latency goals, and (ii) theoretical foundations to characterize the fundamental resource requirements and optimal operating points of edge computing systems. The algorithmic innovation and provisioning insights for achieving ultra-low latency in this proposal will guide the deployment of edge computing systems in large scale, greatly benefiting latency sensitive edge applications with strong societal impacts such as cognitive assistance for the elderly and disabled and autonomous driving. The theoretical advances under this proposal will make fundamental contributions to research in stochastic systems, creating new research focuses for interdisciplinary research communities at the intersection of electrical engineering, computer science, and operations research. This proposal will have significant educational and community impact. Both the theoretical approaches and the experiment platforms will be incorporated into the curriculum and course projects at graduate and undergraduate levels at Carnegie Mellon University. Online platforms will also be leveraged to disseminate educational and research materials related to this project for a greater reach. Continuing and expanded efforts will be spent on STEM outreach activities to K-12 students, mentoring students from underrepresented groups for research, promoting the visibility of researchers from underrepresented groups, and initiating online seminars to outreach to the general public.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop (i) orchestration algorithms that dynamically coordinate data and computation for edge computing systems to meet stringent latency goals, and (ii) theoretical foundations to characterize the fundamental resource requirements and optimal operating points of edge computing systems. In particular, this goal will be achieved in two representative operating modes of edge systems (Thrusts I and II), respectively, based on which edge nodes are authorized to process the data generated by clients and whose computing power is being exploited. Then the uncertainty in communication and computation environments will be addressed in an orthogonal thrust (Thrust III) learning-based orchestration. The proposed research will result in the currently missing algorithmic innovation and provisioning insights needed for guaranteeing ultra-low latency in edge computing systems. Specifically, orchestration algorithms will be developed to jointly and dynamically utilize the communication resources under the emerging 5G and beyond wireless technologies and the dispersed computing power of edge servers and edge clients. The cross-cutting approach in this proposal is motivated by the observation that future edge systems will be of large scale, and the approach builds upon significant recent results on large-scale stochastic systems. These results demonstrate that with the right orchestration algorithms, it is possible to achieve ultra-low latency and high system utilization simultaneously in large systems. This proposal will further advance the theory for large-scale stochastic systems to a much greater generality to address heterogeneity, uncertainty, interactions among different types of resources, and dynamic performance-based job execution. These are new unique challenges arising in edge systems and modern applications in general that are highly underexplored in traditional approaches.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many cases, the musculoskeletal system handles these obstacles by itself, independent of control by the nervous system, but the exact mechanisms by which this occurs are not thoroughly understood. The overall objective of this proposal is to elucidate how specific features within the musculoskeletal system achieve the appropriate locomotor behaviors without needing reflex interventions from the nervous system. To achieve this objective, the researchers will study bipedal hopping by kangaroo rats within the context of abrupt changes in slope that can disrupt forward velocity and/or cause unwanted rotational pitch of the body. Novel experiments using a specially designed rotational treadmill will make it possible to expose kangaroo rats to controlled perturbations that mimic ecologically relevant obstacles. The conceptual framework of the studies is that the components of the musculoskeletal system represent an embedded intelligence that can ease the computational burden of centralized controllers for complex dynamic systems. We advance this idea by investigating specific examples in which specialized properties link functional demands, conditional properties, and system state. Translation of the findings can solve long-standing challenges for robots moving stably over variable terrains. Furthermore, the project will involve local high school teachers, who will develop, test, implement, and assess teaching modules based upon the ongoing research to encourage pre-college students to appreciate how the study of basic biology and engineering applications are complementary. <br/><br/>The objective of this project is to elucidate how nonlinearities within the musculoskeletal system express contextually appropriate system properties to achieve desired motor function without needing neural feedback. The approach is to study bipedal hopping by kangaroo rats with abrupt changes in slope that can disrupt forward velocity and/or cause unwanted pitch. More specifically, the research will examine how the actions of ankle extensors are coupled to the mechanics of the feet, and how this coupling is modulated by the nonlinear features of tendon. This coupling is hypothesized to provide the functional benefit of automatically making the foot compliant upon landing to mediate perturbations and then stiff at takeoff to enable propulsion. To test this hypothesis, the research team will use an integrated framework of in vivo, in situ, and in silico methods to obtain behavioral data, test mechanistic hypotheses, and manipulate component properties, respectively. A novel custom-designed rotational treadmill will make it possible to have controlled perturbations that mimic ecologically relevant obstacles. More generally, nonlinearities expressed by a system?s components can expand a system?s range of operating conditions and contexts. The findings will provide guidance for the design of nonlinearities, namely, their type and parameterization, so that the nonlinearities will be advantageous for achieving function while interacting with unpredictable environments. By collaborating with local high school teachers, the PIs will build a network of STEM teachers who will develop, test, implement, and assess teaching modules based upon the research. In addition, the project will provide interdisciplinary research training and mentoring for two graduate students and one postdoctoral fellow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These transistors will demonstrate high performance and low noise characteristics and will lay the foundation for emerging technologies including biosensor devices and circuits.  Though silicon-based electronics have been the basis for innovation for several decades, their performance at atomically thin dimensions breaks down due to the bottleneck in its intrinsic crystal symmetry and associated physical and chemical properties. This project investigates the use of graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides to form atomically thin FETs.  Given their unprecedented physical properties such as material and device tunability and energy efficiency at the atomic level, these devices will revolutionize the use of FETs in new applications that will transform electronics across industries such as communications, healthcare, and environmental sensing.  It is expected that these devices and circuits that deploy them will play a great role in the development of internet-of-things (IoT), Industry 4.0, data analytics, artificial intelligence, and machine learning.

The objectives of the proposal is to rationally design to study correlated electrical transport and noise phenomena in number of two dimensional atomically thin heterostructure field effect transistors involving graphene, hexagonal boron nitride, and transition metal dichalcogenides (such as molybdenum disulfide) by understanding (1) contact engineering with low work function metals and semimetals as source and drain electrodes, (2) edge contacted architectures with large transfer length and low contact resistance, (3) manipulating polar phonons by dielectric engineering using isotopically pure hexagonal boron nitrides and (4) development of antibody/antigen immunosensors with high sensitivity for SARS-CoV-2. Key to all these successes requires a fundamental understanding in material tunability in atomic scale, quantum confinement and relation to band structure, device architecture and integration, and correlated phenomena between electrical transport and noise physics. Based on experimental design parameters and results (such as a two probe vs. four probe measurement design), new device models beyond the traditional silicon transistor and biosensor model will be developed. Quantum confined physics will be exploited to demonstrate their structure and property tunability and their relation to the functionality (e.g., sensing characteristics).<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by ECCS and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To enable general-purpose robots that can offer sophisticated physical interactions with the world, the capability of robots to work under limited perception is essential. However, as traditional approaches sequentially formulate perception and manipulation into decoupled system components, robot manipulation skills have been passively constrained by the perception system. This award supports research to establish a new paradigm for enabling the interactions between perception and manipulation, and will fundamentally transform the roles of both to actively facilitate each other. The key concept, termed as self-identification, is a process where robots start to manipulate objects without full knowledge of the system, or even of itself, while in the meantime creating opportunities for the perception component to acquire necessary information that were impossible otherwise. In turn, the manipulation capability is significantly upgraded with the extra information obtained. As this new ability can improve many real-world robot applications, such as industrial production, household services, and healthcare applications, the results from this research will benefit the U.S. economy and society. This research involves several topics ranging from computer science, mechanical engineering, and sensor technology, to control theory and artificial intelligence. The multi-disciplinary framework will broaden the participation of underrepresented groups and positively impact the engineering education.<br/><br/>This project leverages various types of passive (or low-level) adaptability in robot manipulators, especially that coming from mechanical compliance (springs or soft structures), low-level impedance control, or underactuated mechanisms, to allow the robot to conduct exploratory motions that are externally observed and used within an adaptive estimation scheme to self-identify the system. The robot-object-environment system will be actively reconfigured while maintaining the desired states and stability in an essentially open-loop way, while external observations of these changes are used to generate online estimations and controllers. Essentially, it changes the traditional paradigm from ?sense, plan, act? to ?act, sense, plan?, with an emphasis on efficient and effective task execution under limited sensing. The research team will establish generic self-identification frameworks for model-complete, model-incomplete, and model-free manipulation systems to: 1) compensate for limited perception abilities, where needed, to accomplish tasks that are traditionally infeasible; 2) maximize their perception capabilities to further improve the system?s task-awareness and robustness; and 3) incorporate the results or the entire process of self-identification into manipulation planning and control to enable robust manipulation under physical and sensing limitations.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the cross-directorate Foundational Research in Robotics program, jointly managed and funded by the Directorates for Engineering (ENG) and Computer and Information Science and Engineering (CISE).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award supports fundamental research of a novel casting method for titanium-alloyed parts and cast features ranging from microns to tens of millimeter by using a new type of functional molds, namely, self-boiling molds, produced by three-dimensional (3D) printing. The manufacturing innovation is accomplished through the mechanisms of boiling heat transfer that facilitate heat transfer control at all points of a mold wall to adjust the cooling rate, thus, manipulating the cast microstructures. The impact of this research on US industry will be a competitive technology for controlling key properties of cast titanium components, principally for medical applications, in conjunction with 3D printing functional molds. The spillover effects of this innovation will, as anticipated, have an impact on the casting industry as a whole. Equally important, the project will provide a multidisciplinary training platform in materials, casting and 3D printing for graduate and undergraduate students for next-generation workforce development.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is a fundamental understanding of the self-boiling mold methodology to actively control the temperature history of molten alloys at various locations of a cast part and, thereby, its microstructure and mechanical properties. The analytical foundation for predicting the relationship between the cooling rate of the molten metal influenced by the characteristics of a ceramic mold and boiling medium will be pursued and established along with methods for designing molds of the required cooling rates that assure the desired microstructure distribution. First, the characterization of different self-boiling mold topologies will be studied on a specially designed testbed to establish the relation between boiling modes and mold wall properties and construction, a key factor for determining the cooling performance of the mold wall. Second, the determination of the cooling rates for a given microstructure distribution will be addressed through the formulation of a numerical model based on the Cellular Automaton method. Specially designed sapphire molds will be used for model verification through the visualization of the nucleation process, molten metal flow and temperature measurements. Next, a model-based determination of the self-boiling mold?s properties for a designed cooling rate distribution will be devoted, verified by experiments using the testbed. At the end, self-boiling mold fabrications using 3D printing (based on direct ink writing), sintering and impregnation methods will be conducted followed by micro-casting performance evaluations, demonstrated on micro-laparoscopic forceps.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The pull effects of organizations shape the prevalence and types of research available across policy issues. Organizations tasked with problem solving in education vary in their propensity to solicit research for use in the policy-making process. Organizations also exhibit push effects on the use of research evidence, taking in the supply, and pushing this into resultant regulatory policies. Together, bureaucracies and interest groups synthesize research evidence and use it to shape resulting regulatory policies. In doing so, organizations filter the research used in crafting public policies. The project will enhance the basic understanding of how groups make arguments aimed at influencing public policy, and which groups are more likely to use research to bolster their arguments. The project will provide interest group and education issue profiles for the use of research in developing regulatory proposals in education. The study will generate insights that can subsequently inform strategies used by organizations and citizens hoping to shape regulatory policy decisions in education and other issues. The project will contribute significantly to student training in the process of social research at both the graduate and undergraduate levels by developing skills in working with data, analysis, presentation, and communication of research. The project is therefore in line with larger initiatives across university campuses to engage in skills development. Finally, the project will generate insights for interest groups, policymakers, and citizens hoping to influence education policy, and general lessons for impacting regulatory reform proposals.<br/><br/>The project engages theoretical debates addressing how organizations channel attention to various issues, with a particular focus on how they use research evidence to channel that attention. Regulatory policy-making in education represents a flash-point for the importance of organizations, particularly given their conspicuous absence in two major strands of literature that converge in education regulations. The first is the study of the rule-making process. This literature largely focuses on the role of interest groups in shaping regulatory agendas, ignoring how bureaucracies, like USED, shape both regulatory agendas and the agendas of other actors. The second strand of literature is in education policy, where attention is disproportionately focused on legislation and educational outcomes, all but ignoring regulatory reform as a significant source of policy change. This project focuses on the institutionalized, structured, and transparent process of federal rule-making at USED. This process is unique from nearly all other modes of federal policy-making in that there is a policy proposal, followed by the opportunity for public commenting, then followed by the issuance of a revised regulatory policy. This process allows us to assess the extent to which organizations within USED shape the supply of research evidence from other actors, and in turn, examine how they incorporate research evidence into resultant regulatory policies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Intuitively, doubling a system's computing resources should double the load that the system can process per unit of time, but that is not true of today's databases: beyond a fairly modest system size, adding more computing resources does not scale to proportionate gains in performance.  The key reason is that databases, to perform correctly, must limit concurrent access to some critical data structures: adding more resources increases competition for access to these data structures, creating a bottleneck for the system's performance.  This project introduces a key innovation towards scalable databases. It frees the database from the need, whenever a databases record is modified,  to  immediately update  range indexes---a common form of data organization in databases that tend to become  a hotspot when databases try to scale up their computing resources. To remove this bottleneck, this project develops a  new scalable interface: per-processor-core queues absorb index updates and merge them  in the shared range index data structures periodically, in the background. Eliminating synchronous updates to range indices does not weaken the database guarantees:  the standard correctness criterion of serializability is achieved by globally ordering transactional updates using multi-part timestamps derived from a system-wide clock; data durability is achieved by storing per-core queues in non-volatile memory;  and a new data structure ensures that reads performed on individual records return their most-recently committed value.<br/><br/>Databases are a critical component of modern planet-scale applications. By eliminating scalability bottlenecks and leveraging emerging non volatile memory technology, this project will dramatically reduce the cost to provision databases. In particular, a large fraction of operational cost in multi-billion-dollar data centers is spent on powering a growing number of servers. Improving the scalability of multiple processor cores will increase the density of database deployments, reducing drastically the number of servers required to provision a database: the savings can defer the need for new data centers and storage devices, as more useful work is achieved with existing servers, or reduce energy consumption for existing workloads. The work will also influence  the education of the next generation of database engineers. Proposed lecture and project materials will prepare students to identify scalable database designs when responding to future changes in hardware and application workloads.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Relative to the storage technologies commonly used just a decade ago, these offer unprecedented performance, but at a cost that is also much higher per megabyte of storage. This work uses software to bridge that gap: to build file storage systems that can seamlessly span multiple types of storage technology, from NVM to SSD to traditional disk storage, to reliably store user data at low cost and high performance.<br/><br/>A key innovation is to change the interface between applications and the operating system to streamline file system updates.  Applications ask the kernel for permission to log changes to the file system in per-application NVM. These changes can be applied with performance close to the hardware limits of NVM, often under a microsecond per update. In the background, the kernel copies these changes back to its own data region, providing the illusion that all applications are working on the same storage system. The kernel then copies the data to SSD and disk to make room for additional updates to NVM.<br/><br/>Industry is rushing to deploy these new technologies because of the advantages they bring, but new software techniques are needed to bring those advantages to real users.  As desktops and cloud computing systems are the default platform for all types of computing used by billions of people worldwide, there is the potential for widespread benefit.  In addition, computer science instruction must adapt to address the challenges and solutions to these new technologies, to enable students to thrive in this new environment.

The developed framework will enable the design of autonomous and robotic systems that can interpret and interact with their environment, a critical component for the automation of tasks that must be performed in complex, unconstrained scenarios. These capabilities will be demonstrated through the development of novel agricultural robotic systems that generate accurate models of agricultural crops at varying levels of spatial and temporal granularity.

These research efforts will also introduce a new paradigm for the representation of motion models that enforce temporal consistency among video frames at the pixel level, obviating the need for object detection and localization techniques. Finally, these temporal association methods will substantially simplify the problem of recognizing and reconstructing complex objects in unstructured environments.

To achieve this objective, the stamp's material properties, including strain-stress relationship and modulus, will be characterized by tension tests of thin elastomeric sheets. Employing the measured properties, both analytical models based on strain energy in the stamp and finite element simulations of inflated stamp under deformation will be used to predict the quantitative relationship between the deformation and associated strain. The second objective is to quantify the effects of stamp peeling speed on the interfacial adhesion strength between stamp and inks. To achieve this objective, a model of adhesion strength related to peeling speed will be built based on the energy release rate when peeling to crack an interface between rigid silicon (ink) and viscoelastic elastomer (stamp). After being verified by experiments, the model will be used to predict the effects of peeling speed on interfacial adhesion strength. The third objective is to establish the relationship between the deformation of the stamp and the deformation, strain and pattern distortion of the inks.

So far, III-N lasers are the main candidates, but their material platform requires complex epitaxial growth and lattice constant matching to the silicon substrate. Although solution-processed metal-halide perovskites have been suggested as alternative gain media, and many perovskite lasers have been demonstrated so far, all perovskite lasers to date are optically pumped. Additionally, they operate under ultrafast pulsed pumping and/or at cryogenic temperatures and have a short lifetime. This program starts by developing economical, environmentally stable and silicon-compatible perovskite lasers that operate under continuous wave optical pumping at room temperature. This can be achieved by directly patterning perovskite into high-Q laser resonators with the manufacturing friendly nanoimprint lithography, then defect-passivating the perovskite with polycarbonate. This program further aims to demonstrate electrically pumped perovskite lasers through band alignment tailoring of carrier transport layers for efficient current injection, perovskite-polymer blending for minimal leakage current, low-loss electrode formation to reduce wasteful non-radiative recombination at electrodes, and low-threshold laser cavity design. This work will not only lead to the insertion of perovskite lasers into functional photonic ICs, but also the long-sought-after realization of solution-processed laser diodes.

Due to the high complexity of kernel software, finding all vulnerabilities during the development phase is nearly impossible. In recent years, crowdsourcing efforts have shown great success in discovering kernel vulnerabilities, where security professionals, hackers, and users can all contribute by submitting kernel bug reports. However, research shows that many vulnerability reports, including those generated by automated tools (e.g., kernel fuzzers), are not easily reproducible. Non-reproducible reports can cause significant delays to the patching process or lead kernel vendors to misjudge the severity of the vulnerability. Preliminary research shows vulnerability reports are not reproducible due to 1) missing information on the compilation configuration; (2) a lack of data to construct the contexts for triggering the bug; and (3) inaccurate or incomplete information about the vulnerable kernel versions.

From data breaches to ransomware infections, the increasingly sophisticated attacks are posing a serious threat to Internet-enabled systems and their users. While machine learning has shown great promise to build the next generation of defense, these defense systems are vulnerable to the dynamic changes (or concept drift) in the data caused by attacker evolvement and behavior changes of benign players. Traditionally, detecting and mitigating the impact of concept drift requires significant efforts to label new data, which is challenging to scale up. In this project, the team of researchers will design novel schemes to improve the adaptability and resilience of learning-based defenses that require minimal labeling capacity. The core idea is to use self-supervised learning models, utilizing unlabeled data and obtaining supervision from the data itself.

Finally, the team will move from reactive defense to proactive approaches. The plan is to use adversarial generative models (another form of self-supervision) to synthesize richer data and labels that mimic future mutations of attackers, which will be used to harden the defenses at the training stage.

While a core dump carries a large amount of information, which has long been used for software debugging, it barely serves as informative debugging aids in locating software faults, particularly memory corruption vulnerabilities. <br/><br/>This research project aims to explore, design and develop lightweight, systematic and automated approaches that turn a core dump to an informative aid in tracking down memory corruption vulnerabilities. The proposed research has three key components. First, the project will develop a technical approach to improve the quality of information extracted from core dumps. Second, the project will explore a set of technical approaches to enhance this readily-available information. Last but not least, the project will develop a technical approach to automatically analyze enhanced core dumps and pinpoint the root cause of software crashes. This project will make an important step towards improving information available to developers and analysts debugging vulnerable software."

In reinforcement learning, an adversarial attack manipulates a reinforcement learning agent's sensory observation, flummoxing it. Recently, research has demonstrated that an adversarial attack could be even more practical. Instead of implicitly assuming an attacker has the full control to influence an agent's sensory system, the new type of attack presents an adversarial agent to manipulate the target agent's environment and thus trigger it to react in an undesired fashion. Compared with the kind of attack that alters the sensory observation, the new attack is more difficult to counteract. First, the methods (e.g., adversarial training) commonly used for robustifying other deep learning techniques are no longer suitable for deep reinforcement learning. Second, given a reinforcement learning agent, there are few technical approaches to scrutinizing the agent and unveiling its flaws.  <br/> <br/>This project intends to address these two significant problems by integrating and expanding upon a series of technical approaches used in explainable AI, adversarial training, and formal verification in conjunction with program synthesis. The basic idea is first to learn an adversarial agent informed by explainable AI. Using this learned agent, we then unveil the weakness of target agents and adversarially train them accordingly. Through a robustness check, we evaluate the enhanced agents. If a strengthened agent fails the adversary-resistance check, we fall back on formal verification and program synthesis techniques. Using this unified solution, reinforcement learning model developers could identify the policy flaws of reinforcement learning agents and effectively remediate their weaknesses. This project will provide a stack of technical solutions to scrutinizing and robustifying deep reinforcement learning. If successful, the project will significantly advance the field of AI security (for adversarial training and adversarial policy learning) and contribute to the field of machine learning (for explainable AI and verified AI). Besides, this project has the potential to improve the security of reinforcement learning applications significantly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To help tackle this challenging problem, by harnessing the data revolution and advancing capabilities of artificial intelligence (AI), this multidisciplinary project aims to design and develop a data-driven and AI-augmented framework that is tailored to the evolving localized conditions and enables expert-in-the-loop for adaptive NPIs to effectively respond to the dynamics of epidemic while balancing the multidimensional socioeconomic impacts. The proposed work will not only benefit local and federal governments, regional communities, corporations, societal leaders and the public by assisting with effective responses to the public health issues while mitigating negative socioeconomic impacts and various induced crises, but will also facilitate the development of robust science-based decision support systems responding to future natural or man-made disasters. The research will be beneficial to multidisciplinary areas, including data science, machine learning, epidemiology, economics, social and behavioral sciences. The outcomes (e.g., open-source code, data, and models) will be made publicly accessible and broadly distributed through publications, media presses, etc. This project will integrate research with education, including novel curriculum development, student mentoring, professional training and workforce development, and K-12 outreach activities aimed at underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>To combat infectious disease outbreaks with robust response planning, this project includes four interconnected research components to develop an intelligent and interactive decision support framework that allows in silico exploration of extensive possible NPIs prior to the potential field implementation phase. First, the team will develop a novel spatial-temporal heterogeneous graph model to abstract dynamics of harnessed multi-source data. Second, the team will develop new techniques to learn node (i.e., area) representations over the constructed graph by integrating both spatial and temporal dependencies while preserving the heterogeneity. Third, based on the learned node representations, given a set of NPIs, the team will design and develop an innovative NPI-aware multi-head transformer for multi-task prediction (i.e., forecasting epidemic dynamics and associated socioeconomic impacts). Fourth, based on the predictions, the team will develop a novel multi-agent reinforcement learning model with inverse reward learning to enable expert-in-the-loop in finding optimal sequential NPIs that balance epidemiological benefits and socioeconomic costs under certain constraints and objectives set by policy and decision makers. The research will advance the field of information integration and informatics through the development of a series of original works including novel deep graph learning techniques with the context of heterogeneous and dynamic graph structures, which will also provide foundational work for addressing similar challenges for future natural or man-made disasters.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

And which ones can be solved in a reasonable time? This brought in the notion of polynomial time solvable problems which are considered efficient vs NP-hard problems which take prohibitively long time to solve. The field of approximation algorithms, along with the theory of inapproximability, deals with which of the NP-hard problems can be solved efficiently by allowing approximate solutions. However, this crude distinction of algorithmic efficiency--polynomial vs NP-hard, is insufficient when handling today's large scale of data. We need a finer-grained design and analysis of algorithms that pinpoints the exact exponent of polynomial running time, and a better understanding of when a speed-up is not possible. Unfortunately, except for a few problem-specific innovations, the study of such algorithms is deeply lacking in the literature.<br/><br/>This project targets to build a unified theory of fine-grained algorithm design to study fast approximation algorithms, and their fine-grained hardness. Developing systematic techniques that emphasize on the trade-offs between running time, approximation and randomness, and aid in designing low-complexity parallel algorithms will significantly improve the state of the art. Moreover, motivated by core machine learning applications, the project proposes an alternate model of efficiency via classical query complexity. Tools from classical query complexity have previously inspired development of fast algorithms and vice versa; the PI expects similar connections to happen in this project. Elements of this endeavor will be integrated with new courses, many of the algorithms developed herein will be implemented and the close connection of the PI with industry will result in possible adaptation of methodologies.<br/><br/>The project will address a suite of important optimization problems, from long-standing open questions to modern problems with diverse applications. It will introduce fresh tools from additive combinatorics, fourier analysis, rate distortion theory, and circuit complexity for analysis of algorithms, and establishing lower bounds. Specifically, new generic techniques of amnesic dynamic programming, fast matrix-product over semiring, and low-degree polynomial method will be developed to design fine-grained approximation algorithms and their parallel counterparts. Time complexity may not always be the primary measure of efficiency. There are many core machine learning problems where query complexity, that quantifies the amount of labeled data acquired via active querying, is more important. The project will analyze for the first time the query complexity of basic learning problems, and explore its connections to developing fast algorithms."

Such meetings could include review panels, academic study groups, classrooms, or board meetings. The ability to understand, manage and react to the social processes occurring within such a group is a core aspect of social intelligence, which is important for collaboration in many contexts. This project is aimed at developing an integrated computational framework useful for analyzing the behaviors of individuals in a group; evaluating the interactions occurring within the group; and measuring any collective behaviors that might emerge from the group. This will be accomplished by exploring novel machine learning techniques to understand human behavior in face-to-face meetings. Outcomes of the study will advance understanding of collaboration and interactions in areas such as personalized health and STEM teaching and learning. The investigator will involve students and faculty who will be trained in the use of computational methods for teaching and learning, as well as cross-cultural interactions.<br/><br/>The investigator will apply social dynamics and computational methods to expand understanding of social interactions in face-to-face engagement using a level of analysis that reveals subtle signaling, personality, affect, and individual and collective influence. Testbeds will be developed from video data of students learning in a summer research program and new data sets will be developed based on faculty learning groups and students participating in a learning group at a University abroad. The first step will involve codifying individual behaviors and creating a model to generate data clusters representing prototypical behaviors in group meetings. Facial action units will serve as inputs into the model. The next step will explore interactivity of codified clusters representing individuals. Coupled recurrent networks will be used to understand interaction and influence by linking chains of sequenced data and applying recurrent neural networks. This variant of recurrent neural networks will be validated using artificially generated data sets. A third step will explore macro-emotions in groups by mapping individual behavior and personality types to influences on collective group emotion. Observations and features from an existing data set comprising galvanic skin response, facial expression, action units and gestures will be used. Methods to fuse these multimodal inputs will be explored and will consist of early fusion techniques (clustering) and later fusion techniques (regressors and classifiers). The testbeds for this research are diverse, including individuals with sensory disabilities and underrepresented minority groups. Methods emerging from the research could be used to assess learning and collaboration in classroom settings, meetings requiring strategic decision making, and study groups.

To accommodate this increase in population, global food production will need to increase by 70-100%. Chemical fertilizers, such as phosphate rock, are commonly used to improve crop yields. However, many of these fertilizers are non-renewable resources that will continue to decrease in supply as the demand continually increases.  Alternatives to chemical fertilizers are, therefore, necessary to continue improving crop yields into the future. This need, combined with increased public awareness of host-associated microbial communities (microbiomes) and the benefits they provide to their hosts, has turned the attention of the agricultural biotechnology industry towards harnessing plant microbiomes by developing probiotics that increase plant growth and productivity. Before these plant probiotics can have widespread success as an alternative way to improve crop yields, it must be understood how microorganisms inhabit plant tissue consistently and robustly despite encountering various hurdles to colonization. In addition to plant-produced chemicals that can limit microorganism growth, other microorganisms competing for similar niche space can affect each other's growth directly via products such as antibiotics. This research will explore the mechanisms used by microorganisms to protect themselves against these harmful chemical attacks. Planned educational activities will provide education, resources, and training to local and regional communities, targeting underrepresented groups. Together, the intertwined research and educational plans will provide a new perspective to improve and complement product development by agricultural biotechnology companies to expand their potential success to enhance plant productivity.<br/><br/>Plants evolved in a microbial world, and, as with many other multicellular organisms, specific subsets of microorganisms assemble into stable host-associated microbiomes. Recent massive parallel sequencing studies using the universal 16S ribosomal RNA gene defined microbiomes for a wide variety of plant species. Results demonstrated clear overlap in internal root (endosphere) microbiome composition, even between the evolutionarily divergent monocots and dicots and across diverse soil reservoir microbial communities. These commonalities suggest that selective pressures, likely imposed by both the plant immune system and competing microbes, exist and limit successful colonization of the endosphere. This work will explore specific interactions between collections of Streptomyces isolates, non-Streptomyces isolates, and genetic mutants of Arabidopsis thaliana as a tractable model system. Streptomyces were chosen based on their ability to: colonize roots from a variety of plants, influence the viability of other soil microbes through production of secondary metabolites, and be controlled the plant immune system. This research will test the hypothesis that Streptomyces species act as keystone members of the endosphere through investigation of how chemicals produced by host plants and/or microbes shape root microbiome membership. The knowledge gained from these studies could facilitate consistent and robust plant colonization by beneficial microbes, even in the face of direct microbial competition and host defenses. Understanding these mechanisms will be critical as we move from basic lab experiments into development of plant biological products to increase crop yields, and thereby, global food security, as the human population continues to rise.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cardiovascular diseases are often chronic conditions that involve several costly emergency visits or long hospitalizations for the patients. Limited access to medical facilities in rural communities can result in worse health outcomes for these patients, in particular, the American Indian (AI) patients living in remote and rural areas. A considerable number of Arizonan AIs with cardiovascular conditions may be at risk of missing the window of opportunity for effective treatment and experiencing a lower chance of survival because of living far away from medical service providers. Arizona has the third largest population of Indian Americans who live in rural, tribal and often extremely isolated areas. The cardiac patients living in these areas do not have the required timely access to care, in particular to specialty services like cardiologists. Therefore, an important challenge related to these conditions for rural patients is the ?early detection of deterioration in symptoms?, which is critical for ?just in time? interventions. This planning project is a collaborative effort among the Northern Arizona University (NAU) and University of Michigan (UM) as well as community leaders in rural and tribal health to discuss the best strategies to utilize an integrated remote heart monitoring system to benefit the patients with chronic heart conditions who live in rural, remote and isolated tribal areas.<br/><br/>This planning project offers several innovative approaches by working with the tribal AI community to begin(i) Developing a new remote heart monitoring technology to predict the deterioration of the symptoms and occurrence of critical heart conditions in patients with some common chronic cardiac conditions such as atrial fibrillation and congested heart failure. Several remote heart monitoring systems have focused on reliable detection of such events, however by the time that the device alerts the patients or their family, it is already too late to seek medical help for the patients who live in rural and remote areas. Hence, our early prediction framework can give the patients enough time to seek medical assistance. This system can also help caregivers control severe symptoms, reduce readmissions, and reduce the cost associated with care; (ii) Developing deep learning-based and Markov-based prediction methods; and (iii) Developing on-device prediction methods that can work independently of the cloud in order to service the patients with no access to broadband internet.

However, until now, it is still challenging to secure long-term stable and accurate signal acquisition, especially in wearable condition, not only for medical application in hospital settings, but also for daily well-being management. Motion-induced artifacts widely exist in electrophysiological recording regardless of electrodes (wet, dry, or noncontact). These artifacts are one of the major impediments against the acceptance of wearable devices and capacitive electrodes in clinical diagnosis. This project is to provide new strategies to mitigate motion-induced artifacts in wearable electronics and design accurate wearable electronics for daily monitoring and disease diagnosis. The PIs will disseminate the research products to both students and the research community. New course materials will be developed for undergraduate and graduate education. Undergraduate and graduate students involved in the research program will obtain diverse knowledge in hardware design and data analytics. For K-12 students, the PIs will provide an integrated research and educational experience through the programs of Engineering Exploration Day for Girls and the Summer Youth Program at Michigan Technological University. A research demo and hands-on experience for triboelectric generation in textile materials will be developed and provided to K-12 students.<br/><br/>The research goal of this proposal is to understand the fundamental mechanism of triboelectric artifacts in wearable devices and provide synergistic solutions to mitigating the artifacts. Three approaches are proposed to achieve the goal: 1) understanding the mechanism of triboelectric charge generation in wearable condition by physical modeling and experimental validation; 2) guided by the understanding, developing tribomaterial-based sensors to manipulate triboelectric charges for artifact removal; 3) leveraging the proposed new tribomaterial-based sensors and statistical data analytics for true electrophysiological signal estimation. If successful, the synergic knowledge produced by the project will not only help improve the traditional bioinstrumentation in the medical society, but also benefit industrial community of consumer wearable electronics."

Leaky gut, or increased intestinal permeability, is an unhealthy gut lining that may allow partially digested food, toxins, and microbes to be released. This may trigger inflammation and changes in the normal gut flora that could lead to problems within the digestive tract. Currently, there are no products on the market with clinical evidence of ability to address leaky gut. The proposed technology may relieve leaky gut and its associated inflammation, as well as improve the host?s microbiome. The proposed technology increases the presence of beneficial bacteria indiscriminately by making the gut a more suitable place for probiotics to live and thus does not decrease microbiome diversity. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a bacterial strain called Lactobacillus paracasei D3.5 that was discovered by screening hundreds of human-isolated bacterial strains to treat leaky gut.  The bacterial strain was selected for its unique ability to stimulate mucus-secreting cells of the colon called goblet cells. Because the components of the bacteria responsible for these effects become more bioavailable after killing the bacteria with heat, the heat-treated version called Postbiotic LPD3.5 was used for a subsequent preclinical study. In this study, the preparation was found to restore the thickness of the colonic mucosal layer in aging mice, which then led to the recovery in tightness of the connections between epithelial cells lining the gut. Both of these effects prevented bacteria and toxins from leaking through the digestive tract into the blood stream, and relieved the associated inflammation, a condition referred to as leaky gut. Moreover, Postbiotic LPD3.5 also was shown to strengthen the host?s bacterial community, decrease anxiety, and improve insulin sensitivity, muscle function, and memory. In order to test whether Postbiotic LPD3.5 is able to stimulate the mucus production in humans, human goblet cells were treated in vitro. The effects seen in human goblet cells were the same as those observed in goblet cells of mice.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The FW-HTF cross-directorate program aims to respond to the challenges and opportunities of the changing landscape of jobs and work by supporting convergent research. This award fulfills part of that aim.  Effective decision making by power grid operators in extreme events (e.g., Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico, the Ukraine cyber attack) depends on two factors: operator knowledge acquired through training and experience, and appropriate decision support tools. Decision making in electric grid operation during extreme adverse events directly impacts the life of citizens. This project will augment the cognitive performance of human operators with new, human-focused decision support tools and better, data-driven training for managing the grid especially under highly disruptive conditions. The development of new generation of tools for online knowledge fusion, event detection, cyber-physical-human analysis in operational environment can be applied during extreme events and provide energy to critical facilities like hospitals, city halls and essential infrastructure to keep citizens safe and avoid economic loss for the Nation. Higher performance of operators will improve worker quality of life and will enhance the economic and social well-being of the country. The project's training objectives will leverage existing educational efforts and outreach activities and we will publicize the multidisciplinary outcomes through multiple venues.<br/><br/><br/>The proposed project will integrate principles from cognitive neuroscience, artificial intelligence, machine learning, data science, cybersecurity, and power engineering to augment power grid operators for better performance. Two key parameters influencing human performance from the dynamic attentional control (DAC) framework are working memory (WM) capacity, the ability to maintain information in the focus of attention,  and  cognitive flexibility (CF), the ability to use feedback to redirect decision making given fast changing system scenarios. The project will achieve its goals through analyzing WM and CF and performance of power grid operators during extreme events; augmenting cognitive performance through advanced machine learning based decision support tools and adaptive human-machine system; and developing theory-driven training simulators for advancing cognitive performance of human operators for enhanced grid resilience. A new set of algorithms have been proposed for data-driven event detection, anomaly flag processing, root cause analysis and decision support using Tree Augmented naive Bayesian Net (TAN) structure, Minimum Weighted Spanning Tree (MWST) using the Mutual Information (MI) metric, and unsupervised learning improved for online learning and decision making.  Additionally, visualization tools have been proposed using cognitive factor analysis and human error analysis. We propose a training process driven by cognitive and physiometric analysis and inspired by our experience in operators training in multiple domain: the power grid, aircraft and spacecraft flight simulators. A systematic approach for human operator decision making is proposed using quantifiable human and engineering analysis indices for power grid resiliency.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work lies within the purview of algorithmic mechanism design, which deals with the optimization of economic systems wherein many parties with conflicting objectives compete for possession of resources. Insights from this area apply to the design of all kinds of markets ? big or small, brick-and-mortar or electronic ? and play an increasingly important role in the rise of new electronic marketplaces such as online advertising, the cloud market, the rideshare industry, crowdsourcing marketplaces, etc. The project focuses on the objectives of maximizing the seller's revenue or the economic efficiency of the allocation. For each of these objectives, the goal is to develop solutions that are simple to implement, broadly applicable, and near optimal.<br/><br/>The first part of this project will focus on the revenue-maximization objective under a so-called buy-many constraint. This natural constraint requires that the seller cannot limit the number of times a buyer can interact with the mechanism, and is satisfied in most real-world contexts. Imposing this constraint imparts a nice structure to the optimal mechanism, and should thereby allow for much better approximations in the absence of any further assumptions than previously known. The second part of this project will develop algorithms for efficient resource allocation in online settings where buyers arrive in the market over time and allocation decisions must be made without knowing future demand. The goal is to develop simple pricing-based allocation mechanisms that nevertheless achieve near-optimal performance.

Because of urbanization, cities now host the majority of the human population. As a result, more wildlife must contend with the novel and extreme environments posed by urban landscapes. A major consequence of urbanization is ecological homogenization, wherein urban environments across the globe are more similar to each other than they are to adjacent undisturbed surroundings. This environmental similarity begs the question: Do species that successfully colonize cities follow predictable evolutionary paths to success? This study examines evolutionary mechanisms involved in adaptation to urban heat islands using a widespread lizard species (Anolis cristatellus) that has independently colonized several cities across Puerto Rico. This research will detail the extent to which urban populations display greater heat tolerance than their forest counterparts.  The study will measure diverse performance traits over a range of temperatures. Those data will be used to identify groups of genes involved in thermal acclimation that display elevated divergence within each urban-forest pair. Additionally, an audio documentary series for the general public will be produced which focuses on the various ways human activity shapes the biology of nonhuman species. This high risk-high reward research exploits a novel methodology that could greatly advance our understanding of the genetics underlying thermal physiology and adaptation on anthropogenic time scales. <br/><br/>Preliminary data show that three of these colonization events are associated with signatures of selection at the organismal, regulatory, and genetic levels. This suggests candidate mechanisms that drive parallel selection in urban environments. The research will integrate population and physiological genomics to identify the genetic basis of thermo-hydric phenotypes important for adaptation to urban heat islands. This study will integrate several modern physiological approaches into a single experimental design. The plan is to conduct simultaneous high-throughput quantification of thermal performance curves across 21 subordinate traits associated with metabolic, respiratory and pulmonary physiology. These populations will then be examined for patterns of allele specific expression to identify evolutionary mechanisms of repeated adaptive regulatory evolution. Comparing divergent physiology, gene expression, genetic variation, and the mechanisms by which they have evolved across the three focal population pairs will provide unprecedented insights into adaptive physiological evolution in the face of anthropogenic habitat alteration. The mechanisms driving local adaptation and plasticity of thermal physiology are likely to play important roles in colonization of novel environments, adaptive divergence, and resilience to environmental perturbation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Each time an organism makes this choice, it must also cope with the associated trade-offs that directly impact both its survival and reproductive fitness. Despite the critical importance of choosing between self-maintenance and reproduction, the mechanisms that shape these decision-making processes is not yet understood. In addition, it is not clear how resource availability, such as the quantity of body fat stores and the presence of mates and food, influences the motivation to pursue one opportunity over another. The goal of this project is to understand if and how glucocorticoid hormones interact with specific neuropeptides in the brain to regulate the behavioral switch between reproduction and feeding. This project provides outstanding opportunities for student involvement, with hands-on training in techniques that integrate neuroendocrine methods with behavioral analyses in the field. All project participants receive training in effective science communication techniques using a teaching module that includes participation in a community-based workshop on the ""Neurobiology of Decision-Making."" The proximate goal is to broaden the participation of students in science education and community outreach. The researcher also incorporates project results into inquiry-based learning modules for use in the classroom, thereby exposing many more students to scientific discovery than is typically achievable in the laboratory. <br/><br/>This project merges field and laboratory studies to better understand the neuroendocrine basis of decision-making. Because the decision to pursue reproductive versus foraging opportunities occurs on a short time scale (minutes to hours) in many animals, it is often difficult to disentangle the mechanisms that regulate both the individual behaviors and the transition between them. In this context, organisms that exhibit seasonal transitions between temporally distinct life-history stages can illuminate the mechanisms that regulate the underlying behaviors in all animals. Red-sided garter snakes (Thamnophis sirtalis) are a phenomenal vertebrate model in this regard because reproduction and foraging are relegated to temporally distinct life-history stages, and snakes undergo dramatic changes in hormone-brain-behavior relationships during the transition to foraging. Based on extensive preliminary data from the investigator's laboratory, this project tests a model in which glucocorticoids interact with the neuromodulators arginine vasotocin and neuropeptide Y to facilitate life-history transitions. The investigator uses a combination of pharmacological manipulation, immunohistochemistry, Western blot, and behavioral assays to achieve the following aims: (1) Determine the function of elevated glucocorticoids during life-history transitions; (2) Determine how glucocorticoids interact with neuromodulators to induce life-history transitions; and (3) Determine if and how neuromodulators are associated with altered sensitivity of the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal axis. Results from this project will provide a framework for understanding the neuroendocrine basis of decision-making and the mechanisms by which neuroendocrine signals reconfigure regulatory systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The confluence of these enormous crowdsourced data can contribute to an inexpensive, sustainable and large-scale decision system that has never been possible before. Such a system could vastly improve the efficiency and cost of transportation, healthcare, and many other applications.  The main obstacle in building such a system lies in the problem of information veracity, i.e., individual users might provide unreliable or even misleading information.  This project identifies important research questions in the task of mining reliable information from noisy and unreliable crowdsourced data, and pursues an integrated research and education plan to address these questions.  Through integrating data from various sources, this project addresses information veracity, which will benefit the many applications where crowdsourced data are ubiquitous but veracity can be suspect.<br/><br/>In particular, this project develops novel methods to mine reliable information by taking into consideration various properties of crowdsourcing: 1) Crowdsourcing platforms collect users' observations about certain objects. Other valuable information sources, such as spatial-temporal, user influence, and textual data, are leveraged to effectively detect reliable information from these observations. 2) Effective privacy protection and budget allocation mechanisms are designed to better motivate active crowdsourcing. These investigations are integrated with the exploration of both theoretical and practical aspects of the proposed methods. From the theoretical perspective, fundamental questions regarding the confidence in the estimated reliability and the convergence of the proposed methods are explored. From the practical perspective, the proposed methods are adapted to tackle challenging problems in various applications such as transportation, healthcare and education to enable new insights into these domains.  In addition to the research advances, this project contributes to educational innovation, as the proposed methods are applied to educational methodologies such as peer assessment and question answering.

These properties also allow them to be used in devices that operate at high temperatures and voltages, which is crucial for power electronics. This project researches methods to create advanced power electronics using an ultrawide bandgap semiconductor, aluminum indium nitride (AlInN). AlInN, used in combination with gallium nitride, has the potential to produce high performance power electronic devices.

Power devices created in this program will positively impact the nation's economy and increase energy efficiency. Graduate students will be trained in the essential areas of advanced semiconductor materials synthesis, materials and device physics, and device fabrication and design.

In these applications, complex motions such as bending, twisting, and straining are present. Most soft sensor designs respond similarly to these deformations, which limits their accuracy if more than one deformation occurs. Origami patterns, which have unique mechanical properties that cannot be achieved in flat materials, are promising solutions for more accurately measuring complex deformations. The goal of this work is to measure how stretchable and soft origami behaves and to study whether soft, origami-patterned sensors can distinguish pressure, strain, and curvature to realize a new class of soft deformation sensors. Soft, origami-patterned sensors will be modeled and fabricated. Their mechanical properties and sensing performance will be characterized. Female undergraduate engineering students at a women's college will participate in carrying out this research through summer and semester-long research opportunities. In conjunction with the research objectives, this project will encourage middle school students and teachers to learn about flexible sensors through a series of workshops. <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to investigate whether soft material origami demonstrates mechanical properties that are advantageous for selective or multimodal strain, pressure, and curvature sensors. Silicone elastomers are flexible and compliant, which makes them excellent materials for use in soft sensing applications. Flat elastomer sensors, however, have non-specific responses to curvature, strain, pressure, and force. Changing the sensor morphology to bias the response towards one deformation may decouple these deformations while preserving the elastomer's advantageous properties. Origami and kirigami patterns are a promising approach to decoupling deformations and increasing mechanical selectivity. By modifying the pattern and fold angle or cut angle, origami and kirigami tessellations can tune the material's Poisson's ratio and stiffness. The project has three research objectives: 1) to model and characterize origami-patterned silicone elastomers under mechanical deformations, 2) to combine patterns that successfully decouple deformations with soft sensing modalities (e.g., resistive, capacitive), and 3) to fabricate origami patterned sensors with variable stiffness folds to demonstrate reconfigurable, high-dynamic range sensors. This investigation will increase fundamental understanding of the mechanical properties of origami-patterned silicone elastomers. The fabrication work will also yield new knowledge about generating such patterns in silicone elastomers and techniques to integrate mechanical sensing modalities into soft, three-dimensional structures.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Potentiometric biosensors, which output a voltage as a function of target biomolecule concentration, are ideally suited for POC use in which sensitivity, speed of detection, portability and compatibility with low-power read-out circuitry are all paramount. Unfortunately, most demonstrations of such sensors stall during the translation from testing well-controlled laboratory solutions to operating in serum or whole blood. The objective of this research is to overcome this hurdle by using a class of advanced artificial intelligence techniques known as Deep Learning to recognize patterns and relationships in the complex data that is collected from blood-based tests to improve sensitivity and drive the design optimization of these sensors. This approach will be applied to the detection of circulating histones in blood, which contribute to the development of Multiple Organ Dysfunction Syndrome (MODS) in critically ill patients. It is estimated that 15% of all intensive care unit (ICU) admissions in the United States result in MODS, costing the healthcare system billions of dollars. Currently, there is no biomarker to identify those patients at increased risk of MODS. The successful development of the proposed Deep Learning-enhanced histone sensor will allow for the early identification of patients that will benefit from more aggressive and targeted therapies to prevent MODS and related complications. These concepts will be integrated with wearable device challenges for high school students, and data will also be included in undergraduate and graduate curricula.<br/><br/>The proposed research consists of answering the following scientific and engineering questions: (1) What is the conventional limit of detection and speed of response of RNA aptamer-functionalized potentiometers to circulating histones? RNA aptamers specific to histones will be used to functionalize gold sensing electrodes to establish, for the first time, the limit of detection and speed of response of extended gate potentiometers capable of early identification of MODS. These devices will be evaluated in buffer, serum and whole blood as benchmarks for POC deployment. (2) How can Deep Learning improve the performance of potentiometric biosensors beyond their conventional limits when assessing whole blood? Potentiometric biosensor performance relies on several factors (e.g., electrode choice, surface functionalization, sample type, etc.), which make their translation to blood analysis a major challenge. We will leverage deep learning techniques to reveal intricate relationships and trends to compensate for the conventional losses in sensitivity observed in blood-based tests. These findings will also drive the optimal design of the potentiometric sensors, thus establishing design rules that can accelerate the development of these sensors across the community. (3) What is the optimal method to develop training data for deep learning? A major obstacle to the application of Machine/Deep Learning techniques to biosensing is the generation of adequate training data. A multiplexed potentiometric biosensing platform, made possible by the use of the extended gate approach, will be developed in order to identify time- and resource-efficient approaches to algorithm training. This effort will establish a standardized protocol that other researchers in the field can leverage in order to accelerate the adoption of potentiometric biosensors in new applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The major goal of this research is to develop a predictive understanding of the role of microbes as drivers of Critical Zone biogeochemistry and soil formation. The researchers? preliminary investigations across the former Critical Zone Observatory Network identified variable patterns in microbial biodiversity with increasing soil depth across sites, with some sites showing little to no change with depth, and others a complete turnover of the microbial community members.

This project will train numerous undergraduate students, most of whom will be underrepresented minorities at several Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) and high schools in underserved communities across California. Results will be disseminated to the greater public through a series of webinars that will provide real life examples of how to address Critical Zone science questions by leveraging diverse scientific backgrounds, as well as through incorporation into the ?Welcome to the Critical Zone? public museum exhibit at The University of Arizona?s Flandrau Science Center.<br/><br/>This project will address the hypothesis that soil type, hydrology, and lithology are key determinants of the depth to which surface influences such as vegetation and climate drive microbial community composition, diversity, and activity. Specifically, where soils are deep or are derived from nutrient- rich bedrock, the researchers hypothesize that rooting depths will be greater, resulting in a greater similarity between surface and deep soil microbial communities compared to those from shallower soils or those developed from less nutrient-rich substrates. In this proposed project, the researchers will use a novel combination of DNA and RNA sequencing, real-time soil gas and environmental monitoring, quantified enzyme activities, detailed soil organic matter and isotopic analyses, as well as root abundances to address the hypothesis. To amplify the impact of this approach, the project will develop a unique and detailed geomicrobiology characterization of key indicator species of bacteria, archaea and fungi, grouped to distinguish those that are surface-based and those representative of bedrock interactions.
