The goal of this research is the design, synthesis, and characterization of high-spin radicals, possessing the unusual parallel electron spin alignment and/or embedded within chiral structures.  Structures of these radicals are optimized to provide single-component materials with electrical conductivity, paramagnetic agents for dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, as well as organic spin filters for spintronics. As the proposed research activities involve organic synthesis, diverse physical/materials characterization, and computations, they will provide an opportunity to gain a broad education for scientists at all levels.<br/><br/>The design and synthesis of these unconventional radicals, that are evolving with increasing complexity and challenge, provide excellent platforms for creative thinking and problem-solving. The syntheses of the unconventional molecules are of noteworthy interest related to the unusual synthetic methodology. The proposed conducting ultra-robust high-spin radicals provide better insight into electron (or hole) transport in cross-conjugated pi-systems, which are commonly known to be detrimental to the conductivity. They will enhance our understanding of the impact of multiple singly-occupied near-degenerate bands and strong antiferromagnetic interactions between the high-spin molecules that facilitate the electron transport. The proposed magnetically and thermally robust high-spin diradical that is optimized for molecular fluorescence would provide the first example of fluorescent high-spin diradical with near 100% population of the triplet ground state at ambient conditions. Those high-spin diradicals that are optimized for high DNP enhancements could advance the DNP NMR spectroscopy and its applications. The proposed enantiomerically pure double helical high-spin diradical dications and triradical cations are intriguing novel molecules with thermal robustness, enantiomerically pure chiral pi-system, and strong paramagnetic properties. The strength of chiroptical properties of the proposed double helical high-spin diradical dication is comparable to those of [n]helicenes, and thus, the coexistence of chirality and strong paramagnetism may render unique chiromagnetic properties that provide a novel platform for the discovery of new organic magneto-optic materials and efficient organic spin filters for spintronics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

PICK1 is a signaling protein that helps transport cellular proteins and has been linked to various diseases including Alzheimer's, Parkinson's, and addiction to cocaine. This project aims to use computational techniques and experimental validation to investigate the key steps involved in biological processes related to PICK1, with the goal of understanding how physical interactions and specific components of PICK1 influence its biological functions. The computational strategy developed in this project can also be used to explore the atomic-level interactions and the dynamics/interactions of other large flexible proteins and their complexes. This project will provide K-12 and PUI (primarily undergraduate institution) students with research experience through computational workshops and summer research sessions. The goal is to increase student retention rates in New Mexico and promote STEM education, especially for underrepresented minorities and women in rural areas. The research outcomes of this project will be used to create Virtual Reality based outreach programs to raise awareness of Substance Use Disorders (SUD) among younger generations and contribute to the development of the Chemistry & Chemical Biology curriculum at the University of New Mexico.<br/><br/>This research project aims to utilize a novel computational solution to investigate 1) the interaction mechanisms of PICK1 with its binding partners, 2) the inter-domain dynamics associated with the biological functions of the PICK1 dimer, and 3) the key residues and physical interactions that regulate the biological function related structural and mechanical properties of PICK1. This goal is to ultimately be achieved by the application of advanced physics-based atomistic and coarse-grained simulations, which can now reach relevant timescales for large proteins such as PICK1. This approach is expected provide high-resolution simulation data to facilitate our detailed understanding of the structural and dynamic properties of PICK1 that ultimately control the interaction mechanisms of PICK1. In summary, this project seeks to use advanced multiscale computational chemistry methods to provide fundamental insights into the functional mechanism of PICK1 and contribute to the broader understanding of signal transduction mediated by such signaling proteins.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One would like to have public confidence that these lotteries were conducted fairly, specifically that the results were random and without bias and that they were not predictable or secretly known prior to their official announcement. Today, nearly all lotteries either provide no technical assurance to the public whatsoever or rely on ancient means of physical randomness generation such as rolling dice or spinning wheels. This project will build a solid scientific foundation for cryptographically verifiable lotteries that can provide strong assurance, even to remote observers, that a lottery was fair.<br/><br/>To do so, this project will develop new tools from the emerging field of temporal (time-based) cryptography, including verifiable delay functions and timed commitments. Temporal cryptography is a powerful building block for distributed randomness protocols and other applications, but key questions remain on how to parameterize and analyze such protocols. Second, the project will develop the theory of temporal cryptography and consider its relation to classic bounds and impossibility results on randomness generation, consensus and general multiparty computation protocols. Finally, this project will build a practical understanding of lottery requirements and user expectations through empirical study of lottery mechanisms and user studies to understand current expectations and reactions to cryptographic verifiability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recently, the connection between Fourier analysis and geometric measure theory has led to substantial progress in both fields. This project explores the interaction between these two fields, along with possible applications to other fields such as dynamics and number theory. The project also supports workshops for graduate students and early-career mathematicians: these events will promote mathematical expertise within the indicated research areas, will contribute to the professional training of participants, and will foster new research collaborations.<br/><br/>The project combines work in restriction theory (within Fourier analysis) and the theory of projections (within geometric measure theory). One component of the planned research involves the study of the mass of a function, with Fourier transform supported on the sphere, on a fractal set.  Another component investigates the dimensions of fractal sets under certain linear or nonlinear maps parametrized by curved manifolds. A final component concerns the Kakeya conjecture, which asks how large must a set be if it contains a unit line segment in every direction. These three components, while distinct, are highly interrelated, and progress in each area is anticipated to inform ongoing work in all of these areas.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Scientific breakthroughs in developing innovative and green energy technologies can move economies away from fossil fuels, reducing the effects of climate change. Hydrogen possesses the highest energy content per weight among combustion fuels and produces only water as the product; therefore, hydrogen is regarded as a promising ""green fuel."" Hydrogen production from the photocatalysis process by splitting water utilizing sunlight and photocatalyst materials is a promising method of generating clean energy. Designing innovative photocatalysts is the primary step to realize efficient hydrogen production. Dr. Dahal is developing innovative, low-cost, and potentially highly efficient heterostructure photocatalysts comprising two-dimensional (2D) metal oxides and 2D transitional metal dichalcogenides. As part of the project, Dr. Dahal will also examine the correlation between the photocatalytic efficiency of the heterostructures to their size, density, chemical composition, and electronic properties. The project will offer opportunities to train students in cutting-edge nanoscale science within the context of modern energy and environmental applications. The proposed research is strongly interdisciplinary and teaches students physics and chemistry concepts that better prepare students for entry into advanced degree programs and/or careers in academia and industry. <br/><br/>In this project, the Dahal research group is studying fabrication methods and growth mechanisms of heterostructures incorporating 2D-ZnO and 2D-WS2. Dr. Dahal will implement the physical vapor deposition (PVD) approach to grow 2D-ZnO nanoislands on the 2D-WS2 support prepared using the chemical vapor deposition (CVD) method.  PVD is a desirable method because it enables the control over morphology, size, density, chemical composition, and electronic properties of the heterostructures. Dr. Dahal will characterize nanostructure morphology, size, and density using atomic force microscopy. Photoemission will give insight into the chemical composition and electronic states of these heterostructures, and the conducting mapping measurements should provide additional insight into the quality of the interfaces. The PVD and CVD growth methods have the potential to enable the formation of high-quality interfaces. Dahal and his team will evaluate the photocatalytic efficiency by measuring the rate of degradation of an organic dye solution in the presence of these heterostructures under UV/visible irradiation. The group will also directly quantify hydrogen evolution efficiency from water-splitting reactions under light irradiation using the gas chromatography technique. Due to the synergistic effects, the proposed heterostructures can potentially be more efficient than conventional photocatalysts because they can offer a wider light-harvesting range, enable a low probability of charge recombination, and provide many active reaction sites on exposed surfaces. In terms of broader scientific impact, this  project has the potential to bring forward a new class of photocatalysts using 2D metal oxides and 2D transition metal dichalcogenides and is expected to provide useful information on the properties of the target heterostructures such as crystallinity, crystallinity phases, surface structures, band gap modifications, and defects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The core goal is to support community formation, the exchange of ideas, and to foster novel cutting edge research to synthesize knowledge of this long pandemic. Activities will be organized to bridge past findings of social studies of HIV/AIDS with contemporary trajectories in the field focused around three core themes: the archive, expertise, and participation.<br/> <br/>Social and humanistic scholarship on the HIV/AIDS epidemic in North America has distinct phases. The period prior to 1996, before effective treatments for HIV, was marked by a wide array of scholarship on the pandemic. However, public attention to HIV/AIDS experienced a decline and fragmentation after more effective treatments became available ? sometimes with the mistaken rationale that the pandemic was over (or at least well-managed) and coupled to a ?second silence? in public attention to AIDS. Biomedical innovation has resulted in treatments that can enable a person living with HIV to live a lifespan comparable to that of an HIV-negative person. However, antiretroviral therapies are not cures, they come with side effects, require access to resources and stability to remain in care (from health insurance to housing), are dependent on the pharmaceutical industry, and overall, have not ended the pandemic locally or globally. Four decades into the pandemic, even as many countries proclaim that they will end their HIV/AIDS epidemics by 2030, there is no actual end in sight. HIV has become a long pandemic, one that is both exceptional while also overlapping with many ongoing human rights, economic and public health crises.<br/> <br/>This RCD project aims to overcome the intellectual fragmentation that accompanied the second silence on HIV/AIDS in STS and its constituent disciplines by creating infrastructure to support a scholarly community around these topics. This project will assemble a productive research community via a series of three annual workshops; by developing an online forum for coordination; by supporting new research collaborations with small grants; and by creating a robust mentorship program that will pair early career scholars with more established scholars. The project will support the next generation of scholars focused on social studies of illness and will seek to develop general insight for both long-standing and emerging pandemics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Results from this project will be applied to increasing the efficiency of using this organism to genetically engineer and breed crops in a predictable, directed manner. Results from this project may also be applied to basic research questions involving genetic manipulation of a variety of plant species, providing a new set of tools for understanding the genomics and evolution of multiple plant species. Finally, results from this project may be applied to close relatives of Agrobacterium, some of which are involved in beneficial relationships with their hosts and some of which are potentially pathogenic to plants, livestock, and humans. This project provides education and outreach activities that emphasize solidifying the identity of students as scientists. These activities include incorporating research experiences into undergraduate coursework and supporting students and faculty from nearby colleges as summer research scientists in an active research lab. Both of these sets of activities will have participants performing hypothesis-driven experimental work in support of the research objectives of the project.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to detail the genetic framework governing cell cycle control in Agrobacterium tumefaciens and how cell cycle control is modulated in ecologically relevant contexts, contributing to persistent colonization. The central hypothesis tested in this work is that in Agrobacterium the PdhS-DivK-CtrA regulatory pathway is a central point of environmentally-responsive cell cycle regulation enabling efficient host colonization, niche construction, and pathogenesis. The first research objective will determine the molecular mechanism by which the PdhS sensor kinases coordinately regulate CtrA activity, specifically exploring the in vivo and in vitro interactions of protein components of this pathway. The second research objective will catalogue the full suite of genetic loci under CtrA transcriptional control using transcriptomics approaches. The third research objective will quantify the contribution of PdhS-DivK-CtrA pathway activity to niche construction and pathogenesis through competition assays during plant infection. The rationale for this project is that it will establish the validity of targeting cell cycle regulation to control plant colonization. This project will contribute to our understanding of the ecological significance of observed cell cycle changes during plant interactions in Agrobacterium and how such changes are effected. This work will expand our mechanistic understanding of cell cycle regulation in Agrobacterium, as well as how cell cycle control integrates with other phenotypes.

The major thrust of this research is based on photoassisted approaches, i.e. using light as a readily available energy source, allowing for rapid access to complex molecular architectures. Besides the fundamental importance of learning about the interactions of light and matter in the context of synthetic chemistry, the targeted complex heterocycles, i.e. molecules that contain nitrogen, sulfur, or oxygen atoms as a part of a ring, are intentionally designed to resemble alkaloids, an important class of natural products that may possess useful therapeutic properties. Importantly, this award will also support research experiences for undergraduate and graduate students, including those from historically underrepresented groups in science, thereby working toward inclusive excellence in the field of organic chemistry. <br/><br/>This research aims to further expand the synthetic photochemistry toolbox, specifically to further develop excited state intramolecular proton transfer (ESIPT)-based photoassisted synthetic reaction cascades. For example, the Kutateladze group is targeting hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) in triplet states, designed to achieve large step-normalized complexity increases in the synthesis of complex heterocyclic molecular architectures. This work will also include a vertical growth in complexity through post-photochemical transformations. Reaction mechanisms and the stereochemistry of these ESIPT-triggered cascades will be investigated to better understand how these transformations achieve their stereo- and regiochemical outcomes. The experimental work will be augmented by computations that have been designed to facilitate solution structure elucidation of the complex heterocyclic products by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. The newly integrated machine learning-augmented density functional theory (DFT) method for fast and accurate calculations of the NMR parameters will be expanded to explicitly account for the effect of solvents on the predicted spectra. This sub-theme of the proposed research is critical for the success of this project because of the structural complexity of the target molecules.

If intelligently coordinated, these systems will unlock transformative societal benefits across broad economic sectors. They also promise to contribute to the most pressing challenge of the century??climate change??by substantially utilizing resources more effectively, such as from supply chains, energy systems, and urban systems. Unfortunately, effective coordination schemes have been elusive due to the sheer scale and diversity of scenarios that these systems encounter. To advance robust coordination in large-scale CPS, this project investigates the generalization of learning-enabled methods as a key solution concept, in light of their potential to translate coordination schemes across disparate scenarios. The project's impact will be enhanced through the dissemination of open-source research and teaching material, and via experiments derived from large-scale CPS applications in collaboration with public sector, industry, and academic partners. The project also boosts K-12, undergraduate, graduate, and professional education, by supporting and actively engaging students in research activities, promoting the translation of research to practice, and through outreach efforts targeting middle school students from underrepresented and underserved communities.<br/><br/>This NSF CAREER project focuses on an enabling methodology for large-scale CPS: understanding generalization of learning-enabled methods, and further applying it to reduce the complexity of system design and analysis. Recent evidence shows that controllers trained using machine learning sometimes have the remarkable ability to generalize to other scenarios, such as to different problem sizes or between simulated and physical robotic systems. However, generalization is currently more of an art than a science; the conditions under which generalization is successful are not well understood. At the same time, large-scale CPS often induce parameterized families of scenarios; for example, traffic control must consider different weather conditions, sensing modalities, and numbers and types of agents. This family of related CPS scenarios thus provides a platform for carefully examining generalization across scenarios. The project will: 1) advance learning algorithms for large-scale CPS by designing coordination-aware model-based reinforcement learning methods for multi-agent systems; 2) leverage the algorithms to understand generalization by formalizing, measuring, and characterizing generalization with respect to deviations in CPS scenarios; and then 3) harness generalization for robust coordination, by efficiently solving large families of scenarios necessary to provide high performance and assurances.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Decades of studies have generated significant knowledge about how to improve the oxidation resistance of structural materials, with strategies including the use of alloying elements, coatings, and surface treatments. However, many of the mechanisms behind these strategies remain elusive limiting our ability to design better performing alloys. In this context, the project addresses the impact of deformation and small grain sizes on the oxidation response of selected structural alloys. The work specifically focuses on elucidating the key role of diffusion along moving grain boundaries supplying elements to the alloy surface to form an oxide layer. This ubiquitous mechanism has been largely ignored and therefore unexplored in the context of alloy oxidation; yet it can explain the impacts of surface deformation and small grain sizes on the oxidation behavior of alloy systems.<br/><br/>This program contributes to the general scientific understanding of diffusion along moving grain boundaries as a ubiquitous mechanism in crystalline materials under diffusive conditions and increases our mechanistic understanding of materials under extreme environments with impact on the development of new alloys and microstructures, particularly in the context of advanced manufacturing processes.

In addition to its scientific and technological impacts, the program also contributes to the recruitment, retention, and training in advanced research methods and techniques of a diverse student body and workforce through its research activities.

While avenues to improve the oxidation resistance of structural materials, i.e., alloying, coating, and surface treatments, are commonly used, many of the mechanisms behind these strategies remain elusive limiting our ability to design better performing alloys. The project addresses the hypothesis that diffusion-induced grain boundary migration (DIGM) is ubiquitous in alloy oxidation and uniquely explains the impacts of surface deformation and grain refinement on the oxidation behavior of alloy systems. To support this hypothesis, this project uses a series of increasingly complex alloys, from model Ni alloys to multi principal element alloys for which diffusion kinetics have been the object of debate. The program quantifies DIGM during alloy oxidation, generating observations, experimental data, and analyses necessary to increase our understanding of solute transport and phase transformation during DIGM with implications for not only oxidation modeling and mitigation but also for any conventional and complex concentrated alloy under diffusive conditions at intermediate temperatures where DIGM can occur. The approach combines systematic series of experiments using state-of-the-art characterization techniques tying micron scale observations to atomistic mechanisms, establishing the knowledge base for future modeling and computational approaches within the Materials Genome Initiative.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Quantum mechanics was initially developed in the early twentieth century as a theory of the motion of a single electron around the nucleus of a hydrogen atom, but it can also describe the motion of a large number of electrons in metals and semiconductors, and this description was vital to the electronics revolution. The past few decades have witnessed the discovery of numerous ""quantum materials"" in which the role of quantum mechanics is more profound than previously thought and not well understood. In quantum materials, it is important to treat the motion of electrons collectively, and account for the entanglement between the different electrons. Most prominent among these new materials are the high temperature superconductors found in a series of compounds which contain copper, oxygen, and numerous other transition metals, which can conduct electricity without any loss of energy above a relatively high temperature. In this project, the PI and his team will develop a theory of electronic motion in such materials focusing especially on a regime of temperatures and electron density where the motion of electrons is most unlike those in conventional materials. This regime is often called the ""strange metal"" phase, and it is clear that the mutual entanglement of electrons plays an important role in bringing out the peculiar properties of this phase. This project will build on the successes of a model previously developed by the PI, which provides a simple setting in which the entanglement between the electrons is, in a sense, maximal, and yet the equations of quantum mechanics can be solved exactly. The PI and his collaborators have recently extended this model to a more realistic setting which maintains its solvability, and this yields an encouraging correspondence with observations on strange metals. This project will extend this understanding of the strange metal to other phases of quantum materials, including those exhibiting superconductivity at high temperatures and microstructures that consist of one-atom-thick sheets of carbon atoms stacked in various configurations on top of each other.<br/><br/>This award will also contribute to the development of the scientific workforce by supporting the training of graduate students and postdoctoral associates in topics at the forefront of theoretical condensed matter physics. Furthermore, the PI will continue to pursue an active program of public lectures, interviews, colloquia, and lectures at schools for advanced graduate students.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>This award supports theoretical research which will examine the ""strange metal"" phase of quantum matter, which is ubiquitous in correlated electron systems, especially those that exhibit higher temperature superconductivity. A complete, quantitative understanding of the strange metal phase is essential to progress in the theory of quantum materials. The PI and his team have recently made progress on a theory of strange metals, which has the attractive features of being simple, universal, and broadly applicable across the range of correlated materials. In this project, the team will further develop the Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model and related theories and compare the results quantitatively with numerous experimental probes. For the cuprate superconductors, the strange metal phase will be related to various neighboring phases, including the pseudogap, the superconductor, and the charge-ordered phases.

The zeta function is the most fundamental example of an L-function, which is a mathematical construction that combines arithmetical information about all the primes at once.  More general L-functions, such as Dirichlet L-functions, are useful for understanding primes in arithmetic progressions.  One of the main ways that L-functions are studied is by placing them into families, such as the family of all Dirichlet L-functions, and viewing their properties through this framework.  Much of the proposed work in this proposal concerns the development of properties of new families of L-functions.  One of the main goals is to better-understand the size of these L-functions, especially in certain ranges that have been inaccessible using previous methods. The PI will continue to mentor and collaborate with undergraduate students, particularly through the Texas A&M REU. Such opportunities are important for preparing students for graduate studies, particularly for undergraduate students from non-PhD granting institutions as well as from population groups underrepresented in STEM fields. The PI will also continue to advise PhD students to work on problems related to families of L-functions and their moments.<br/><br/>The PI will study new families of automorphic forms and their associated L-functions, especially via moments of L-functions and large sieve inequalities.  The PI plans to study high moments of L-functions in order to make progress on the challenging but important L-functions in conductor-dropping families.  The proposer will also study narrower families of L-functions through the use of new versions of the relative trace formula that isolate small families based on their local behavior.  In a related vein, the proposer will study large sieve inequalities for families of automorphic forms, with two main goals.  One objective is to establish large sieve bounds in some of the new, narrow families.  A second goal is to develop heuristics for conjecturing the size of a large sieve bound for more general families.  The PI will mentor PhD students on problems on moments of L-functions for both narrow families and for higher degree L-functions.  The proposer will study newform Dedekind sums with his undergraduate students.   The methods employed will be techniques from analytic number theory such as functional equations, exponential sums and integrals, and the spectral theory of automorphic forms, including the Arthur-Selberg trace formula and the relative trace formula.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A major goal in chemistry is the development of sustainable chemical reactions that minimize the production of hazardous waste and operate under energy-efficient conditions. The co-principal investigators (co-PIs), Drs. Chianese and Keith, are using a combined experimental- and computer-modeling-based approach to elucidate the mechanisms of catalysts for the epoxide hydrogenolysis reaction. While this is an important reaction in the pharmaceutical and chemical industries, current methods for this reaction produce significant amounts of hazardous waste, which limits the sustainability of the process. Replacing traditional chemical reagents with hydrogen gas has the potential to significantly reduce the reaction?s cost and environmental impact. Understanding how the reaction works at a microscopic level would contribute basic scientific knowledge and facilitate the design of the next generation of improved catalysts. The research for this project is being conducted by undergraduate students in the laboratories of the PIs at Colgate University. Participation in undergraduate research, especially early in a student?s career, is increasingly recognized for its positive impacts on students and for broadening participation in the sciences. Chianese and the students working in his research group devote a day each summer to an outreach activity for high school students attending Camp Fiver, a residential summer camp that hosts a group of at-risk students New York City and rural upstate New York.<br/><br/>In previous NSF-funded research, PIs Chianese and Keith used a combined experimental/computational approach to determine the mechanism of ester hydrogenation catalyzed by a widely used complex, Milstein?s catalyst, and showed how the catalyst converts from its original form to the form active in catalytic hydrogenation reactions. In the current project, Chianese and Keith are applying this knowledge to a new transformation, the ruthenium-catalyzed hydrogenolysis of epoxides. The project aims to develop highly active catalysts for epoxide hydrogenolysis that are selective for one isomer of the product alcohol, and to understand how these catalysts operate at the molecular level. In another thrust, the Chinese-Keith research team will revisit the previously proposed mechanisms of related hydrogenation reactions promoted by Milstein?s catalyst, building on their recent discovery that Milstein?s catalyst irreversibly transforms upon heating to a different form with a catalytically relevant hydrogen bound to a nitrogen atom. This project has the potential to result in new, more sustainable chemical transformations, and to improve our understanding of how these reactions proceed at a molecular level.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematically, such optimal shapes are interpreted as solutions to free boundary problems, a kind of generalized differential equation where the edge of the shape is one of the unknowns being solved for. Free boundary problems are a classical but difficult topic in mathematical analysis, and the goal of this project is to develop more robust tools for understanding the local and global characteristics of wider classes of such equations. Better mathematical understanding may lead to smarter and safer approaches to the applied problems through rigorous approximation schemes, analysis of stability under perturbations, and rigid qualitative properties of solutions. This project offers training opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers, in a mathematical area with important industrial applications.<br/><br/>The specific topics to be considered include multi-phase or vectorial Bernoulli problems, two-phase parabolic free boundary problems of various types, discontinuous semilinear problems lacking scale invariance, free boundaries for nonlocal operators, and transmission problems.

However, the connections between these processes and how they influence the discharge, source, and nutrient concentrations of water in Arctic rivers are not well understood. To characterize shifting river source contributions and bridge this knowledge gap, this project will measure multiple components of the water cycle in permafrost watersheds across a range of glacial coverages (including glacier free) in Greenland. Models will test the hypothesis that in the warmer and wetter future Arctic, contributions from flow through the ground to the river will both increase and persist later in the season, which will help offset the loss of river water from steadily decreasing ice masses. Research and education are integrated by collaborating with several Arctic focused institutions and local Greenland communities to develop a platform that increases student participation in hydrology. This platform includes programs like Greenland field research opportunities for Alaskan and Greenland students and development of Arctic water cycle focused courses. <br/><br/>Three important hydrological shifts associated with a warmer and wetter High Arctic Greenland occurred within the last million years: 1) increased freshwater from glacier melt; 2) deepening active layer (permafrost thaw); and 3) increased precipitation. Current climate shifts are leading to an Arctic Greenland more like these past environments. A warmer Arctic will likely increase active layer depths, which when coupled with greater rain expected in the Arctic, could result in more flow through the active layer contributing to river discharge, but this remains unknown. This project will measure multiple components of the water cycle in permafrost watersheds across a range of glacial coverages (including glacier free) in High Arctic Greenland. These data will characterize shifting river source contributions and provide critical field data needed to calibrate novel numerical hydrological models. These models will then help test river discharge hypotheses given future Arctic change under different climate scenarios (e.g., more precipitation, deeper active layer). These analyses will help understand how increased active layer flow could mitigate the hydrological impact of glacier recession and future transition to ice-free watersheds. This project will support graduate and undergraduate students and develop a powerful multifaceted platform to increase participation in STEM fields. A new Arctic focused hydrology course will be taught via distance delivery. This project will also provide students with a transformative experience learning together in the field while working with researchers. Larger societal benefits include understanding how the Arctic water cycle is changing, which can impact the global water cycle, freshwater resources, and climate patterns across Earth.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Moreover, as criminal groups become involved in the industry, rural workers and small landholders are often dispossessed of land and forced to migrate. Violence, deforestation, and forced migration have each been associated with profitable commodities separately, but the interrelationship between them has rarely been examined holistically. Building on an interdisciplinary research group, this study addresses three questions: what type of native vegetation is lost when the cultivated area of a lucrative agricultural commodity expands? Is the high profitability of a commodity linked with increased cartel presence, and are women and children disproportionally impacted and forced to migrate? The project?s results have implications for commerce, human rights, and national security. Furthermore, it provides training, mentorship, and professional development to postdoctoral researchers and to undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>As Land Change scientists collect evidence and develop analytical approaches for understanding the relationship between global markets and loss of habitats, it is essential to know how markets create additional social externalities, as crime and violence flourish in the absence of effective institutions.

This project will improve flood hazard assessments for lowland rivers by understanding and harnessing fluvial dynamics, thus improving the safety and sustainability of river management science. A research plan focusing on observing and simulating floodplain sedimentation to improve flood hazard assessments is coupled with an education and outreach plan that increases participation in geomorphology and redefines rivers as dynamic features that provide beneficial services to people and ecosystems. The research tests hypotheses describing controls on fluvial sedimentation that are critical for predicting and managing the accumulation of pollutants and sediments for floodplain management and restoration. Increasing the geoscience workforce and public engagement in research are critical for the long-term move towards improved river management, and this project is expressly designed to increase participation in Earth sciences through immersive research experiences for community college students and to elevate public awareness of fluvial dynamics through K-12 initiatives.<br/><br/>The traditional paradigm in lowland river and floodplain management relies almost exclusively on systematic stream gage data as the key dataset informing flood hazard assessments, while largely neglecting the geomorphic dynamics and resulting sedimentary records preserved in floodplains. This project builds on the PI?s prior work in the development and application of alluvial stratigraphic records by harnessing recent advances in hydraulic modeling to constrain flood hazard assessments via robust paleoflood estimates. The research objectives are to (1) establish a long-term observatory to monitor floodplain sedimentation, (2) develop hydraulic model simulations on modern and theoretical floodplain geometries, and (3) integrate models and observations of sedimentation to link streamflow to sedimentation patterns in a dynamic alluvial setting. The research plan leverages state-of-the-art hydraulic modeling with an observational network of environmental sensors and sediment cores to test a series of hypotheses describing the landscape controls on alluvial sedimentation patterns, and then it applies the findings to constrain flood hazard assessments through high precision paleoflood estimates. This research is integrated with an education and outreach plan designed to (1) attract, motivate, and train community college students in geoscience research through an established internship program, and (2) develop a platform for raising public awareness of dynamic fluvial processes through K-12 initiatives.  <br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Geomorphology & Land-use Dynamics and Hydrologic Sciences programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cells communicate by directly touching or by sending materials out to other cells. One of the ways that cells send materials is via extracellular vesicles. Extracellular vesicles are collections of nucleic acids, proteins, and lipids that are held together by a protective envelope. When cells receive these extracellular vesicles and unpack the vesicle?s contents, they change their behavior. Even though this form of communication is important, the nature of vesicle formation and selection of their contents is not well understood. The goal of this project is to enhance understanding by determining the factors that cause cells to produce vesicles and the factors that influence what materials are packaged inside of them. Understanding extracellular vesicle formation and packaging has the potential to result in new medical interventions. This work will be undertaken with secondary students and undergraduates. The research experience will equip them with the training and professional development necessary to create knowledge for this project. The outcomes of student engagement in this research will also expand understanding, by generating outcomes and new research questions in vesicle biogenesis.<br/><br/>The specific knowledge that will be enhanced by this project is the role played by integrin-substrate interactions on extracellular vesicle biogenesis, subpopulation production, and selective cargo packaging. In this work, engineered hydrogel substrates will be deployed to engage integrins expressed by astrocytes, which represent a compelling system for studying extracellular vesicle biogenesis. Because their function is coupled to environmental cues, the ability of these astrocytes to respond to extracellular signals is necessary for the fitness, survival, and healthy function of the nervous system. This project seeks to determine how cell engagement with integrin-specific peptides influences the extracellular vesicle production and to provide an experimental platform that can be modified to decipher the signals and mechanisms that promote extracellular vesicle production. An understanding of the mechanisms underlying extracellular vesicle biogenesis will afford new insights into the fundamentals of cell-cell communication and provide new avenues for creating vesicle-based therapeutics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project trains a post-doctoral scholar and PhD student in scientific and mathematical methods and theory.

While these theories are well supported, they often present a limited, unidimensional characterization of identity. In this project, investigators develop cultural evolutionary theory to understand how multifaceted group affiliations respond to individual incentives, including the costs and benefits of coordinating identities and cooperation. Specifically, it builds a new statistical approach that identifies and measures the relationships between real groups.

One promising solution for sustainable food production in indoor plant environments is the novel concept of using fertilizer as a dehumidification agent for climate control. In this process, fertilizer-based liquid desiccant is used to draw water vapor out of the humid environment for delivery to the plants. In this way, water is recycled while the indoor environment is dried, and significant energy savings are achieved by avoiding the need for intensive regeneration cycles that are common to most liquid desiccant systems. To realize the goal of unlocking the potential of fertilizer desiccant for efficient dehumidification and water recycling, this project addresses two fundamental scientific and engineering challenges: (1) to develop operational protocols for the real-time control of liquid desiccant temperatures so as to maintain high dehumdification rates and low specific energy use throughout the dynamic recirculation batch process; and (2) to identify mechanisms for improved performance by advancing fundamental understanding of polarization when it occurs across multiple concurrent domains. In addition, this project will support the development of sustainability hubs in Detroit and Pontiac through collaboration with student, community, and industry partners on a series of outreach and education initiatives.<br/><br/>A computational model of polarization across multiple concurrent domains will be developed to describe temperature, vapor concentration, and individual ion concentrations. Because polarization across multiple concurrent domains occurs in a great many different membrane processes, the models developed from this work may have far reaching utility to the membrane science community to improve treatment of polarization analysis. Likewise the analysis of fertilizer dehumidification performance in response to desiccant temperature, and then the subsequent development of appropriate control protocols, will provide insight into batch process dynamics and thermal management strategies more generally. Fertilizer-based liquid desiccant dehumidification can open up new possibilities for energy efficient closed-loop water recycling and humidity control of indoor plant environments, and thereby contribute to a sustainable farming future. In addition, an important teaching and outreach component of this project is included to complement research activity and help align scientific progress with the needs of society. A series of at least 6 student-led volunteer projects will support community gardens and other sustainability initiatives throughout Detroit and Pontiac. Involvement of at least 60 university students is targeted, and will be facilitated by student clubs. This will help to connect students to their communities and foster lasting partnerships between student clubs and community organizations. In addition, new curriculum focused on energy engineering will be developed in close collaboration with industry partners, to help prepare the next generation of engineers for a sustainable energy future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is difficult to study this relationship in humans because of our long lifespans, which may encompass many different periods of food availability that might not be known. This Doctoral Dissertation Research project assesses how lifetime nutrient intake and diet influence survival and reproduction in a wild primate, including during an extreme drought, which had major impacts survival. Extreme climatic events are increasing in severity and frequency world-wide, and the results of this project can therefore enhance our understanding of how diet and nutrition interact with survival during such events. This project serves as the doctoral dissertation for a student in biological anthropology and nutritional ecology, trains two early career female scientists, contributes to the conservation of a wild primate and its endangered habitat, and provides early education opportunities for local school children. <br/><br/>This project focuses on three objectives: 1) Identify the nutritional goals of female white-faced capuchins (Cebus capucinus) across the life course, 2) Identify the best possible diets of female white-faced capuchins across the life course, and 3) Examine how poor nutrient and dietary intake relates to survival and reproduction, especially during an extreme drought that occurred between 2014 - 2016. To address these objectives, researchers collect feeding data on capuchins to determine what individuals eat. Researchers also collect food samples to determine nutrients that capuchins consume. Lastly, researchers use a long-term database (33+ years) to relate intake to survival and reproduction, especially during the drought.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research has the potential to push current research and development boundaries, transform cumbersome analysis protocols, and unfold new opportunities, for example, continuous asymmetric reaction development workflows that eliminate slow and work-intensive laboratory practice. The proposed work is highly collaborative involving industrial and academic partners and provides multiple training opportunities for graduate, undergraduate and high school students from groups underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>Chiroptical sensing assays for primary and secondary amines, amino alcohols, amino acids, alcohols and hydroxy acids have been introduced to date.

However, autistic people remain underrepresented in STEM careers due in part to a lack of transitional supports between high school and college. This project will address this critical gap by providing these transitional supports through a comprehensive, person-centered, near-peer mentorship program in the context of maker clubs attended by over 135 autistic youth and undergraduates. In this program, autistic college students who major in STEM fields will act as near-peer mentors to autistic high school students as they engage in self-directed projects in maker clubs. In partnership with college and high school counselors, the mentors will connect the STEM interests of the high school students with relevant STEM careers and career pathways, while sharing practical advice about resources, networks, and practices that foster self-advocacy and self-determination in post-secondary STEM education and employment. Research will explore whether and how the transition program fosters increased STEM identities, self-advocacy skills, and greater quality of life among the high school students and their mentors. The resulting field-tested and empirically-based transition program will be disseminated widely to makerspaces and other settings, ultimately providing increased access to STEM careers for autistic youth. <br/><br/>Autistic high school students and autistic undergraduate STEM majors will co-design a STEM mentorship program, embedded within maker clubs, which will support the transition between high school and college. Diverse mentors and youth will be paired based on attributes that they identify as important to their mentorship experience, including but not limited to race, ethnicity, gender, language, autistic traits, and STEM interests. Participatory, mixed-methods research will investigate whether the co-designed mentorship program is associated with greater quality of life, self-determination, self-efficacy, self-advocacy, and STEM identity among the high school students and undergraduates. Additionally, this research will examine how and why specific aspects of the mentorship experience have an impact on the effectiveness of the program. To achieve these research purposes, statistical analyses will be conducted on pre- and post-surveys, including the Autism Specific Quality of Life Survey and a STEM Self-Efficacy and Career Interest Survey that has been adapted for and validated with autistic youth. The findings from these data will be triangulated with qualitative analyses of pre- and post-interviews with the mentors and youth. The resulting research will advance knowledge of how strengths-based, participatory approaches can support autistic youth in pursuing STEM career pathways. This research will be disseminated widely through conferences and journals for autism researchers and educators, in addition to STEM education researchers and educators. The co-designed, mentorship-based transition program will be shared through a digital Making Mentors Toolkit. Because this toolkit is based in the experiences and expertise of autistic youth and undergraduates, it is likely to support the accurate and authentic translation of research into practice for autistic people.

These black holes have masses of millions or even billions of times the mass of our Sun. Sometimes black holes feed on surrounding gas or consume stars, ripping them apart along the way. These processes can release enormous amounts of energy, which can have a significant effect on the host galaxy. Despite the importance of supermassive black holes, their origin is far from understood. We do not know how the initial ?seed? black holes formed in the early Universe, how massive they were originally, or in what types of galaxies they formed. We do know, however, that larger galaxies host more massive black holes, suggesting galaxies and black holes grow together. Therefore, finding and studying the smallest ?dwarf? galaxies hosting supermassive black holes can provide clues to the origin of supermassive black holes. The investigator will study the properties of supermassive black holes in dwarf galaxies, leading to a better understanding of black hole formation and galaxy evolution. The research activities will directly relate to the investigator?s educational efforts to inspire Montana youth to engage in STEM and empower K-12 teachers to offer space-related activities in their classrooms. The investigator is a leader in the Montana Space Public Outreach Team (SPOT), which reaches 10,000 students each year in Montana.    SPOT is a science ambassador?s program in which undergraduates are trained to help teachers present science topics in high schools.<br/><br/>The investigator will (1) systematically search for supermassive black holes in dwarf galaxies using untapped multi-wavelength observations and a variety of techniques, (2) characterize the least-massive galaxies that can form a massive black hole, (3) estimate masses of the smallest black holes to constrain seed masses, (4) determine the accretion and radiative properties of low-mass black holes in dwarf galaxies, and (5) probe black hole feedback in dwarf galaxies to inform galaxy formation models at low masses. Finding and characterizing these systems is important for a holistic understanding of dwarf galaxy evolution and feedback, as well as advancing our understanding of the birth and growth of the first black holes in the earlier Universe.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Astronomy and Astrophysics Grant Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These reactions are important for making products ranging from pharmaceuticals to fragrances and any number of fine chemicals. Traditionally these types of reactions are done using specialized equipment and hydrogen gas. The work proposed here bypasses the storage of hydrogen by generating hydrogen during the reaction from readily available precursors. Another emphasis of this research is to make the reactions simpler and less expensive. This will be done through design by constructing catalysts that perform hydrogenations using mild conditions. This funding will support the work of undergraduate students from diverse backgrounds by providing training in various chemistry techniques and an immersive summer research experience. This unique opportunity is preparing them for both obtaining advanced degrees in science fields and contributing to a globally competitive STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce.<br/><br/>The hydrogenation of double and triple bonds is an important reaction in the synthesis of various organic compounds. Transfer hydrogenation is a reaction that uses an easily handled reagent like isopropyl alcohol as a substitute for hydrogen gas, negating the use of specialized equipment associated with using gaseous reagents. Most catalysts for this reaction require the use of base additives and/or an atmosphere free of oxygen and moisture. Dr. Kalman and his research group are developing new ruthenium catalysts based on imidazole carboxamide ligands that operate under aerobic conditions and without additives, which allows for a simpler and less expensive reaction setup. These catalysts operate by metal-ligand cooperation in which the ligand participates in the bond breaking and bond forming steps rather than acting solely as a spectator in the reaction. Specifically, Dr. Kalman and his students are studying how modifications to the ligand structure impact the catalytic activities of the ruthenium complexes, leading to the development of more active and selective catalysts. Further, they are applying these new catalysts to other organic reactions such as acceptorless dehydrogenation, a reaction that is important in both organic synthesis and hydrogen storage.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite an extensive body of work on TBI in biomechanics and neuroscience domains, there is still much progress to be made to advance the knowledge of TBI mechanics and associated motor impairments. In particular, fundamental knowledge of how and to what extent mechanical force impacts brain neuronal activity and, in turn, how and to what extent brain impairment affects neck muscle responses remains unknown. Therefore, this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project seeks to develop a breakthrough computational framework that can mimic realistic brain-muscle activation dynamics and support discovering fundamental knowledge about TBI mechanics and associated interventions. This research requires methods and knowledge from various disciplines, including neuroscience, biomechanics, human factors, and control engineering, thus impacting the convergence of engineering and medicine. The project?s synergistic education and outreach activities outline a plan to strengthen the interdisciplinary field of neuro-biomechanics in bioengineering, industrial engineering, mechanical engineering, and chemical engineering through course development, involvement of graduate and undergraduate students in the research activities, and K-12 outreach activities. In addition, the outreach through webinars and video blogging will enhance scientific literacy levels about TBI among broad audiences, including first responders and TBI patients.<br/><br/>The investigator?s long-term goal is to discover the fundamental relationship between brain multiphysics and neuromuscular dynamics in order to develop engineering technologies (i.e., helmet technologies, neuroprosthetics, etc.) and therapeutic interventions (e.g., TBI-focused rehabilitation, surgical treatments, etc.) to reduce TBI in sports, workplaces, and daily activities. In pursuit of this vision, this project will provide a Brain-Muscle-Interaction framework, called BMI-frame, a closed-loop framework composed of multiscale brain neuronal models, head-neck finite-element (FE) structures, proportional-integral-derivative (PID) algorithms, and neural network (NN) agents. This objective will be accomplished through three specific tasks: 1) investigate the effects of mechanical impacts on brain neuronal signals, 2) identify NN agents to predict brain and muscle PID gain parameters, and 3) characterize brain and muscle responses to mechanical impacts. Task 1 focuses on developing and validating brain electromechanical models to understand brain neuronal response to various (sub) traumatic impacts. Task 2 will explore novel NN algorithms in order to accurately tune brain signals and individual neck muscle activations with a minimal number of iterations and loop delays. Task 3 focuses on validating the BMI-frame platform by exploring the dynamics of brain-muscle interactions in response to various (sub) traumatic mechanical impacts and TBI conditions. The research is a breakthrough innovation as it transforms brain-muscle interaction dynamics into a mathematically-grounded engineering framework, with the purpose of creating unprecedented scientific knowledge about how (sub) traumatic mechanical impacts cause electromechanical disruptions of brain neuronal dynamics and, in turn, how brain neuronal disruptions affect neck muscle responses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Understanding the intersecting identities that result from these connections is a pressing challenge for social science and policy. This project uses both cross-cultural empirical research and theory-driven mathematical modeling to conceptualize and measure group affiliations, developing a suite of empirical and conceptual tools for social scientists to better engage with the complexities of modern social life. The project trains a post-doctoral scholar and PhD student in scientific and mathematical methods and theory. It also creates interactive, publicly available online tools that (1) explain theories of group membership, (2) illustrate how we can empirically measure group affiliations and the relationships between groups, and (3) demonstrate how the integration of theory and measurement can create a more accurate picture of how our social worlds evolve.<br/><br/>This work builds on theories that assert that outward expressions of identity are used instrumentally to facilitate assortment and expedite social interactions, including cooperation and aggression. While these theories are well supported, they often present a limited, unidimensional characterization of identity. In this project, investigators develop cultural evolutionary theory to understand how multifaceted group affiliations respond to individual incentives, including the costs and benefits of coordinating identities and cooperation. Specifically, it builds a new statistical approach that identifies and measures the relationships between real groups. Models are iteratively refined via tests using ethnographic data collected to capture how people understand their own and others? identities across multiple realms of interaction. Despite being evident that individuals hold multiple group affiliations, we do not currently have analytical tools or language that adequately describes the complex nature of group affiliations. This project builds these tools to contribute to understanding how individuals position themselves across a range of social relationships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The answers to these questions underpin the key information conveyed in the overwhelming majority, if not all, of language-based communication. However, current research paradigm suffers from several shortcomings in extracting event knowledge from the open world scenarios. In these scenarios, knowledge extraction from data is limited to a few large domains (e.g., news or biomedical) or common languages (e.g., English, Spanish and Chinese), because of the heavy reliance on the human effort to contextualize data. This includes creating large-scale manual annotations or defining the schematic templates for a few target event types. This project aims to lay the foundation and establish new paradigms for open world event knowledge extraction by developing new and more efficient algorithms to extend the extraction capability to the wide range of scenario, while requiring minimal human effort. This foundation should provide extensive coverage of different event types and be easily adapted to emerging scenarios. The success of this project will directly benefit users of the intelligent information access systems. For applications that analyze emerging and trending topics and events, such as natural disasters, national elections, protest and disease outbreak, success of the proposed research will not only provide an accurate and abstractive summary and easy access of each topic for humans, but also allow analysts to better discover the participants of the events, the cause, effects and temporal orders among them, and help discover more insights. <br/><br/>The technical aims of the project are divided into three thrusts. Thrust 1 develops schema-guided event extraction approaches. This is done by leveraging the knowledge from the complex target event schema, such as the event type structures (i.e., type name and argument roles), hierarchy and temporal/causal/part-whole relations among the event types, which provide valuable guidance, especially when there is few to no annotations available. While event annotations for most of the domains and scenarios are not existing and extremely expensive and time-consuming to obtain, the large-scale unlabeled in-domain data are usually accessible. Thus, Thrust 2 will further develops a suite of more efficient and novel self-training strategies to make use of the large-scale unlabeled data through self-supervision. In practice, there is even no event type schema available to most of the domains and scenarios, such as natural disaster or disease outbreak. Manually defining an event schema with high coverage is extremely challenging and time consuming as it requires background knowledge in both linguistics and the target domain, and humans need to manually examine a large amount of in-domain data to determine the salient event types. Considering these challenges, Thrust 3 further explores novel solutions to automatically deduce the target event schema, including event types, the roles of their participants, as well as their relations from the raw text and extract their event mentions accordingly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The first, the ""Hubble constant"", is a measure of the rate of the expansion of the Universe today. The second describes the equation-of-state of ?Dark Energy?.  Dark Energy is required to explain the increasing rate of expansion of the Universe. Some rare, bright, exploding stars, called ""type Ia supernovae"" (SN Ia), are perfectly suited to this task. Each of these supernovae provides us a single measurement of the size of the Universe at the instant that the star died. Using a new observational project, the Young Supernova Experiment (YSE), the investigator will measure the most uniform sample of SN Ia in the nearby Universe. The investigator will use this sample to develop novel methods of determining the cosmological parameters. With a team of citizen scientists, the investigator will develop new tools to identify type Ia supernovae in the distant Universe, using observations from NSF?s Vera C. Rubin Observatory. Where YSE will find thousands of supernovae, the Rubin Observatory survey, called the Legacy Survey of Space and Time (LSST), will discover hundreds of thousands.   The investigator will also involve schools and citizen scientists in this research.  The investigator will place the observations on the public Zooniverse platform and create Jupyter Notebooks for instruction for local students, including the ?Women Astronomy Summer Camp? and ?Girls who Code? groups. They will recruit students from underserved communities in the greater Central Illinois Region, teaching them machine learning and data science using the material developed in this research.<br/><br/>The investigator will use the YSE supernovae together with the sample from LSST. With an anticipated 1.6% measurement accuracy of the Hubble constant and sub-percent measurement of the equation-of-state of Dark Energy, the investigator will connect the nearby to the distant Universe. Citizen-science is central to the research plan. The investigator will use the Zooniverse platform to identify the host-galaxies of supernovae for the full sample, providing a valuable cross-check on the performance on automated algorithms. <br/><br/>This research award is partially funded by a generous gift from Charles Simonyi to the NSF Astronomy division.

However, the excessive storage and computational needs of centralized approaches, alongside regulatory challenges in sharing private data, put the utility of this paradigm in doubt. Collaborative machine learning is a recent alternative paradigm to tackle these issues by developing algorithms collaboratively without exchanging or centralizing the data. For example, different geographically distributed hospitals, each being in possession of limited patients? data, may collaboratively develop predictive algorithms to improve diagnostics and treatment beyond what could be accomplished alone. Unlocking the full potential of collaborative learning strongly depends on the ability to encourage a large pool of individuals or corporations to share their private data and resources. Towards this aim, this CAREER award offers an intersectional approach to develop theoretically-grounded collaborative algorithms to facilitate learning optimally from fragmented, heterogeneous private data under resource constraints by jointly addressing various computational, statistical, systems, and game-theoretic challenges. By promoting a stable and fair ecosystem to benefit and retain all participants, without imposing stringent data and resource constraints, this project?s outcomes promise to make data-driven intelligent systems more effective, personalized, and robust in a myriad of application domains, such as personalized healthcare, precision agriculture, and education.<br/><br/>To promote a healthy data and compute ecosystem and enable optimal use of distributed heterogeneous data under resource constraints, this project offers an intersectional approach to rigorously address computational, statistical, and game-theoretic challenges. On the practical side, it introduces a pluralistic learning paradigm and develops distributed algorithms that are cognizant of statistical heterogeneity and confined to learning models that meet available resources. On the statistical side, the project focuses on establishing generalization guarantees and understanding information-theoretic tradeoffs, providing an opportunity for synergistic advancements and insights. The project makes an intimate connection between collaborative learning and aggregative games and leverages developed theoretical and algorithmic investigations to answer questions related to equilibrium, incentivization, fairness, and stability to promote a healthy ecosystem. The intersectional and unified study the project proposes, creates essential connections, and fosters new transformative methods not developed by efforts within the individual disciplines. The research will be integrated with education through hosting workshops, mentoring students, and developing courses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Metalated porphyrins are widespread in nature, e.g. hemes, and play crucial roles in photosynthesis and oxygen transport. Porphyrins also have numerous applications in a number of diverse areas, including materials science, catalysis, and medicine. Porphyrins have 4 nitrogen atoms within a central cavity that allow the structure to bind metal ions. However, an important class of related compounds, called carbaporphyrins, have a carbon atom in place of one of these nitrogens. Carbaporphyrins have modified properties that often complement those of naturally occurring porphyrins. The supported work is leading to the development of efficient routes to novel carbaporphyrins and related porphyrin-like systems that have unique reactivity and unusual properties. The results are increasing our understanding of fundamental chemistry concepts such as aromaticity, a fundamental property of molecules that leads to enhanced stability. Furthermore, structures of this type act as ligands to  form stable complexes with important catalytic metals such as palladium and rhodium. Professor Lash and his students are studying applications of these metalloporphyrins in the preparation of fine chemicals. In addition, related such complexes are being explored for use as photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy. These projects are not only providing an excellent environment for training undergraduates and Masters level graduate students for careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) but are also exposing these students to the multidisciplinary nature of modern scientific research.<br/><br/>In this research, new synthetic routes to porphyrin-like systems are being developed, including methodology that makes use of cyclopropane dialdehydes. Applications of the ?3 + 1? variant of the MacDonald reaction will provide structures having extended conjugation with alternative properties. For instance, porphyrin-like structures with fused aromatic rings, including phenanthrene, pyrene and acenaphthylene, will extend the platform and are expected to substantially alter the properties of these systems. Other examples of unique porphyrins include carboporphyrins hydroxyporphyrinoids, and tripyrrolic porphyrins. All these molecules have unique conjugation pathways and, as a result, interesting properties. The strategy to synthesize these substrates should be applicable to virtually all fused aromatic ring systems. These investigations are quite fundamental, providing access to important new porphyrinoid systems, and thus have the potential for major impact on the field of porphyrin chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The actual value of the virtual screening relies on the accuracy of the target-ligand binding affinity prediction. It is recognized as a grand challenge for the virtual screening to accurately predict the target-ligand binding structures (molecular geometries) and binding affinities associated with diverse and massive datasets. This project aims to address the grand challenge in development of machine-learning (ML)-CADD models by introducing new, more effective mathematical representations of molecular geometries with the ability to track molecular geometry changes via Ricci curvatures and their associated spectral information. The outcomes of this project will furnish novel, more reliable computational approaches in essential areas of computational drug design, biomolecular modeling, data analysis, dimensionality reduction, and mathematical biology. Moreover, this project will provide graduate and undergraduate students with training in data analysis, biological modeling, algorithm development, and computational drug design. The enhancement of curricula from this project is planned as a continuation of the investigators' teaching-research practice. The new mathematical framework and deep learning architectures are directly integrated into computer software packages to ensure extensive usage by the community of researchers in drug design, biology, computer science, and mathematics. Additionally, the project will help train the next generation of researchers in advanced mathematics, data science, and molecular biology.<br/><br/>This project will develop novel low-dimensional representations for biomolecular data analysis from mathematics-based approaches and robustness training data to revolutionize the current practice in structure-based virtual screening. The main objectives are: 1) to introduce molecular shape guided persistent Ricci curvature and, at the same time, to provide local geometry and spectral information to reduce the structural complexity while still maintaining an adequate description of biomolecular interactions; 2) to develop a target-ligand adaptive deep learning protocol for post-docking pose selection, binding affinity prediction, ranking, and estimation of other molecular properties; 3) to extensively validate the proposed methods on a variety of datasets to optimize the mathematical representations and learning networks. Specifically, this project will focus on the development of the proposed models for the virtual screening of phosphodiesterase-2 (PDE2) inhibitors, providing valuable hits of a promising therapeutic strategy for the treatment of various human diseases. A close loop integrating computational-experimental models will further strengthen the robustness and accuracy of the proposed models.; 4) to develop user-friendly software packages and web servers using parallel and GPU architectures for researchers who are not formally trained in advanced mathematics or sophisticated machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An innovative aspect of this project is the close integration of experimental and mathematical analyses to investigate impacts of habitat fragmentation, interspecific competition, and predation on coexistence of species at patch and landscape levels. This research will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships that drive ecological systems and contribute to the development of effective conservation strategies. Two important questions regarding biology of interacting species are considered: 1) do predators affect the relationship between density and prey emigration, Allee effects and local or regional stability of prey species? and 2) does the presence of predators affect occurrence or strength of competition-dispersal, competition-reproduction or dispersal-reproduction tradeoffs and therefore coexistence of competitors? The project will also provide significant contributions towards analysis of mathematical models created to study this behavior via development of new tools to better understand model dynamics. Project results will be disseminated to the ecological and mathematical communities through various media including peer-reviewed mathematical and ecology journals and talks at national conferences. This project will involve training of graduate and undergraduate students through mentorship of independent research projects and PI-hosted workshops, with a session geared toward high-school students/teachers that focuses on illustrating value and applicability of mathematical models and ecological experiments to address societal problems. Moreover, an app that estimates key dispersal parameters from field data will be created and made publicly available.<br/><br/>This project combines reaction-diffusion models, mathematical analysis, and experimental research to investigate how habitat fragmentation, conditional dispersal, interspecific competition, and predation influence population dynamics and species coexistence at single patch to landscape scales. The project will involve the study of diffusive Lotka-Volterra competition and predator-prey systems with nonlinear boundary conditions designed to model how density dependent emigration (DDE) affects the dynamics of species at different spatial scales and experiments with two Tribolium flour beetle species and a shared natural enemy to measure DDE relationships and life-history tradeoffs under predation pressure. The Investigators will develop and analyze mathematical models based on the experimental data to explore effects of DDE on coexistence, invasion, and pattern formation. This project is expected to be novel and significant by providing (1) much-needed experimental evidence that interspecific competitors and predators affect boundary behavior namely, the strength and form of DDE, and important life-history tradeoffs linked to species coexistence; (2) the first theoretical framework for the effects of conditional dispersal on the population dynamics and coexistence of competing species and a shared predator in fragmented landscapes; and (3) a significant contribution toward the analysis of systems of elliptic boundary value problems with nonlinear boundary conditions, to better understand model dynamics.

However, disruptions and transitions of routines, such as moving, job changes, or family illness, can interfere with their ability to stick to their goals. When these transitions happen, they might influence how individuals access healthy eating resources or create challenges for people to maintain their healthy eating behavior outside their established routine. Transitions may also create new needs or change people?s priorities around healthy eating. However, current personal informatics technology is typically designed based on the assumption that everyday behavior remains static. As a result, when transitions happen in everyday life, existing technologies struggle to help people assess and adapt to the changing needs, constraints, and priorities. Thus, this project aims to examine how personal informatics systems can be designed to support people in healthy eating when experiencing transitions in their routines, individually and collaboratively. <br/><br/>The initial line of work will be to systematically understand people?s needs and the challenges of healthy eating when transitions in their routines occur. These findings will help create design principles and theoretical foundations supporting technology design around these transitions. The second line of work will iteratively design and develop technologies that can support people to cope with transitions and continue to eat healthily. Finally, the project team will conduct field studies to evaluate the usefulness, usability, and engagement with these technologies over time and in the context of transitions. The project will contribute empirical knowledge, design guidelines, theoretical frameworks, and field-evaluated technology to support healthy eating during transitions in routines.

To function in our information society, consumers must read and accept terms of service agreements, financial agreements, health care agreements, rental agreements, privacy policies, and other varieties of ""fine print"" to receive essential goods and services. These consumer-oriented legal documents (COLDs, for brevity) specify requirements, penalties, boundaries of acceptable use, options for recourse if something goes wrong, privacy practices, intellectual property stipulations, and many other important topics. People tend to accept COLDs without reading or understanding them, and the lack of understanding disempowers individuals and affects them unequally. This project will answer three related questions: (1) What recurring information structures and types of knowledge exist in COLDs?; (2) What are the capabilities and limitations of text mining applied to automating extraction of information from COLDs?; and (3) To what extent do the contents of COLDs intersect with the interests and needs of consumers? Toward answering these questions, the project will develop natural language processing methods that support user engagement with typically unengaging but important text. Additionally, this project will introduce first-year undergraduates to research and encourage them to pursue STEM careers.<br/><br/>The project will advance knowledge by focusing on the following goals. First, the project will discover the availability and characteristics of common types of COLDs by creating large-scale corpora of them from online sources. These corpora will enable studying issues in availability, accessibility, navigation, and readability. Second, the project will develop methods for automated extraction of two particularly salient features of COLD text: choice points (statements in text that describe actions a reader can take potentially for their benefit) and outlier statements (statements that deviate from what is typical for the relevant type of COLD, differentiating a COLD from its peers and motivating acute attention). Third, the project will build browser extensions to explore how choice points and outlier statements affect people's engagement with COLDs' contents. To support further research,  the project also will produce and disseminate an array of corpora, language models, and other tools for researchers in natural language processing and public policy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time, artificial intelligence (AI) and automation continue to penetrate every aspect of human life. Yet despite decades of advances, current technologies in complex transportation, work, and healthcare environments fail to account for the wealth of knowledge that older adults accumulate through their life experiences, which often shapes how they interact with AI and automation. This research aims to overcome this challenge by employing a novel perspective that focuses on the cognitive abilities that improve with age as opposed to those that decline. Specifically, the project will build a framework to: (1) evaluate how older adults apply their crystallized knowledge to decide whether and when to use automation in safety-critical, dynamic settings; and, (2) develop customized decision support techniques that intelligently tailor information to this population's specific needs. Project outcomes will help to change the narrative on older populations from incapable to empowered, inform the design and capabilities of AI to better align with older adults? mental models, promote increased technology usage, extend older individuals? ability to safely and independently collaborate with sophisticated technologies in work, transportation, and leisure settings, and reduce overall technology training needs. A tightly integrated research and education program will engage and empower older adults as well as undergraduate, graduate, and underrepresented students through the development of an interactive online learning community and technology platform, community-based ?design for aging? research projects, and annual ?digital design for aging? competitions.  <br/><br/>Over the next several decades, the presence of autonomous systems will become even more widespread across many environments. This research will provide a fundamental understanding of how older adults? prior knowledge and experiences shape their (intended) interactions with automation and incorporate this understanding into the design of emerging intelligent systems. The project has two major research thrusts: (1) identify demographic, behavioral, and performance indicators of application of crystallized knowledge that can predict automation use/disuse decisions in uncertain situations, and (2) develop an adaptive multimodal decision support system that provides older adults with real-time guidance on when to use automation to maximize safety and performance. A series of human-subject experiments will be conducted in driving, a complex task that older adults have years of experience performing and for which AI and automation promise to extend their ability to perform. Participatory design methods will be used, and data will be collected from younger and older age groups to examine how use of prior knowledge and decision-making strategies change as a function of age. Computational models will be constructed to predict automation use decisions and trigger customized feedback.

Many multimodal fusion strategies have been proposed, ranging from manually designed policies to advanced automated machine learning (AutoML)-based approaches. Although AutoML-based solutions outperform handcrafted ones, they are still far from optimal due to their lack of generalizability in model design and failure to account for the unique characteristics of multimodal data. This project takes the multimodal healthcare predictive modeling task as a representative example, aiming to discover and identify the optimal way to fuse multimodal data via a new learning paradigm, i.e., automated multimodal learning, with minimal human interventions. The success of this project will yield new fundamental knowledge in various fields, including automated machine learning, multimodal deep learning, and healthcare predictive modeling. The new automated multimodal learning paradigm will revolutionize multimodal data mining by automatically searching for new and complex yet optimal fusion strategies from the data, potentially motivating researchers and domain experts to understand the multimodal data better. In addition, recognizing unique research challenges posed by the unique nature of multimodal data in the healthcare domain and providing customized solutions will advance the research of healthcare predictive modeling significantly. <br/><br/>To meet these goals, the investigator proposes to equip automated multimodal learning with the ability to model the unique challenges of multimodal health data, including data size variety, noise, and missing modalities. The investigator also proposes to validate the proposed research for different multimodal fusion tasks in healthcare informatics and beyond and gather feedback from experts to refine the proposed research.  The results of this project will provide a needed paradigm shift toward automated multimodal data fusion, impacting a broad range of research fields, including machine learning, data mining, and healthcare informatics.

These charged macromolecules in any system do not function alone, but all of them work together in collaborative manners. A fundamental understanding of such large scale cooperativity among many molecules is one of the grand challenges in physical and biological sciences. Towards mitigating this challenge, the PI will formulate a fundamental understanding of how electrically charged macromolecules move around in crowded electrolyte solutions, and how to facilitate them to form desirable structures toward novel  water-based materials for societal benefits. In addition, the proposed activities include strong support of diversity and training a new generation of scholars and enable their future participation in industries on water-based materials and maintenance of global sustainability.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The PI proposes experiments and theoretical developments to investigate hierarchical structure and dynamics of charged macromolecules,  topologically frustrated non-diffusive dynamical state, coacervate gel composites, and assembly and phase diagrams for polyzwitterions, by combining light scattering, neutron scattering, fluorescence spectroscopy, fluorescence microscopy, impedance spectroscopy, rheology, single molecule electrophoresis, statistical mechanics, field theory, and several multi-scale simulation techniques. Specifically, the proposal addresses (a) the nature and origin of the newly discovered topologically frustrated dynamical state of polymers, and its transition into the other conventional dynamical modes, such as the Rouse-Zimm and reptation, (b) non-equilibrium forces to control formation of coacervate gel composites, and (c) dipolar interactions to understand assembly and phase behaviors of polyzwitterions. This project is aimed at understanding the intricate behaviors of charged macromolecular systems, and discovering new conceptual models for structure, dynamics, and transport in aqueous charged polymer systems. A fundamental understanding of the behavior of this important class of materials will help to design novel water-based polymeric materials to secure global sustainability with enhanced benefits to society.

Mineral scaling on surfaces, or the unwanted deposition of mineral precipitates, poses a technological challenge to many industrial processes. In membrane-based water treatment, mineral scaling of polymer membranes decreases membrane flux, diminishes energy efficiency, and shortens membrane module lifespan. In the oil and gas industry, mineral scale deposition on the interior surface of pipes can result in complete blockage of pipelines and disrupt oil and gas production. Despite its importance, the role of polymeric solid substrates on mineral scaling is poorly understood.  This research aims to understand how the surface characteristics of polymers impact the formation of mineral scales. The investigators will employ combined experimental characterization and theoretical analysis to examine the nanoscale interactions that drive mineral scale formation on polymeric substrates. The findings of this work will inform design of anti-scaling polymer surfaces in submerged aqueous environments, which will bring significant economic benefits to industries in which mineral scaling plagues system performance and long-term durability. This research project will provide outreach activities  through public engagement at both George Washington University and University of Maryland. The investigators will host a yearly student-run symposium on environmental nanoscience, and host high school student interns and deliver guest lectures to local high school students. <br/><br/>Mineral scaling on surfaces, or the unwanted deposition of mineral precipitates, is a ubiquitous yet unwanted phenomenon in many industrial processes including reverse osmosis, water desalination, heat exchangers, and oil and gas production. One promising strategy for mitigating scaling is to modify polymer surface characteristics or apply polymer coatings to non-polymer surfaces to render the surface scaling resistant. Currently, there is a significant knowledge gap in understanding the nanoscale interactions and physicochemical processes in the initial stages of scale formation on polymers. This knowledge gap limits rational development of scaling-resistant membranes and surface polymer coatings. In this research, the investigators will integrate liquid phase transmission electron microscopy, real-time measurement of scale formation dynamics using quartz crystal microbalance, and theoretical modeling to establish nucleation mechanisms during scaling of silica and gypsum on polyamide surfaces. The research objectives are to 1) investigate the effect of surface charge and hydrophobicity of polyamide films prepared via molecular layer-by-layer assembly on mineral scaling rate, 2) employ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy  to visualize and quantify mineral nucleation dynamics on polyamide surfaces in real time at the nanometer length scale and 3) derive theoretical models for nanoparticle attachment and nucleation kinetics to identify the nanoscale interactions involved in scale formation as a function of polymer surface chemistry. The results of this work will facilitate rational manipulation of nanoscale mineral-membrane interactions to prevent mineral scaling on engineering polymers in the aqueous environment. Educational and outreach aspects of the project will incorporate research findings into undergraduate and graduate course materials, host joint student-run nanomaterial and water symposia, and enhance the participation of underrepresented students in research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In recent years, these rich interactions have led to several remarkable developments between these two fields, and the goal of this project is to essentially capitalize as much as possible on this momentum. <br/><br/>The first part of this project concerns Ramsey theory around the Erd?s-Szekeres problem about the existence of large convex polytopes in finite configurations of point sets in general position, with an eye particularly towards establishing new upper bounds for various classical Ramsey numbers for graphs and hypergraphs. The second part of this proposal is about incidence geometry, an area with roots in Turn-type problems in extremal graph theory which is also fundamentally connected with other branches of mathematics, such as harmonic analysis and number theory, via the so-called sum-product phenomenon. The PI intends to further develop these connections by studying several old and new natural problems that arise on the different sides of this story. Examples of motivating (longstanding) questions include: the Zarankiewicz problem, the unit distance conjecture, and the Heilbronn triangle problem.

Extremal combinatorics is focused on developing a better understanding of discrete mathematical objects that optimize interesting or desirable properties, while probabilistic combinatorics studies discrete mathematical objects that are generated by a series of random choices. These two research directions are intimately related as randomized algorithms are a remarkably powerful tool for the construction of interesting discrete mathematical objects. Furthermore, randomness is a major theme of the work on extremal problems for discrete structures as a deep understanding of the ways in which deterministic objects mimic their randomized counterparts often leads to major progress. This research has the potential to benefit society through the development of new algorithms for computational problems on large networks, new methods for analyzing existing network algorithms, and new codes and communication protocols. The project also provides training opportunities at both the undergraduate and graduate level.<br/><br/>This research is in the broad areas of probabilistic and extremal combinatorics. The work in probabilistic combinatorics is focused on very sharp concentration of global parameters of the binomial random graph and problems regarding the decomposition of the edge set of the uniform random graph into cliques or bicliques. The work on sharp concentration in the binomial random graph is motivated by a recent result of the investigator and a doctoral student that establishes 2-point concentration of the independence number of the binomial random graph over a broad range of the probability parameter. The comprehensive understanding of the extent of concentration of the independence number of the binomial random graph is one of the goals of this part of the research program.

This decomposition was originally developed to prove the existence and study the properties of solutions to certain time-dependent partial differential equations (particularly the heat and wave equations) that are used to model physical processes.  With the demands of such applications as quantum mechanics, medical imaging, and signal encoding/compression, the field has expanded.  Approximating natural signals by mathematical functions, decomposing these functions as superpositions of simpler parts, modeling physical processes by mathematical operations on the parts, and, finally, reconstituting the parts by summation each necessarily leads to errors.  Theoretical harmonic analysis seeks to establish a general mathematical framework by which we can say that, provided the initial approximation and model are close to reality, subsequent errors introduced by the decomposition, mathematical operation, and reconstitution steps are small.  One mathematically proves that such approximations lead to manageable losses by ?bounding? certain linear operators, and it is also of interest to understand the corresponding ?reverse inequalities? by determining what kinds of data lead to the largest possible output. This project seeks to bound and study reverse inequalities for certain mathematical operators, called Fourier restriction and averaging operators in which the curvature of some underlying manifold plays an important role.  Such operators arise, for instance, in studying truncation methods for multidimensional Fourier series, as well as certain partial differential equations motivated by questions in physics.  Curvature causes these operators to behave better than would be predicted by simply counting the dimension of the manifold, and yet many open questions remain about precisely how much better.   The cases when the curvature goes negative or vanishes along some nonempty set or when the underlying manifold lacks the expected degree of smoothness are of particular interest.  These scientific endeavors are inextricably linked with the investigator's efforts to help train the next generation of mathematicians. This workforce development encompasses two main directions: advising and mentoring Ph.D. students in mathematics and creating opportunities for mathematicians at all career stages to meet and interact at conferences and other meetings.<br/><br/>This project will follow three lines of inquiry regarding Lebesgue space bounds for operators in harmonic analysis in which the curvature of some underlying object plays an important role.

The main part of this proposal considers such problems in pathological situations where the curvature of the manifold goes negative or vanishes along some nonempty set, with a particular focus on optimal estimates by using a measure that gives small weight to regions where the curvature is small or by changing the Lebesgue exponents under consideration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, future neural recording and modulation techniques require simultaneously interfacing with multiple neural sites that are distributed over a large brain area. However, current neural interface devices typically consist of a single, centralized structure with transcutaneous connections to electrode/LED arrays, leading to scalability issues. A small number of recording/stimulation channels limits spatial coverage, whereas a large number of channels results in bulky device size, concentrated heat generation, and a high risk of wire connection failure. The goal of this CAREER project is to explore a novel scaling solution involving a distributed untethered network of mm-scale, wirelessly powered, free-floating neural interface implants that enable optical stimulation and electrocorticography (ECoG) recording of large-scale neuronal ensembles over a large brain area. The proposed distributed neural interface system in this CAREER project will advance neuroscience studies and enhance the foundational understanding of the brain. Additionally, this project will expand the utility and capabilities of the rapidly growing field of optogenetics, contributing to the development of new neural prostheses and neuromodulation therapies that can supplement current medication-based treatments for neurological disorders. The education plan of this project will make a significant impact on STEM engagement. The plan involves developing multidisciplinary courses that can be cross-listed with related majors such as biomedical engineering, neural engineering, and neural science, providing research opportunities for students from a broad range of  groups in STEM, and offering mentorship to students for their career development. Outreach activities will also be organized to facilitate the sharing of resources, tools, and knowledge with teachers and students. <br/><br/>The motivation of this CAREER project is to drive progress in the field of neural interfaces by enabling precise neural recording and targeted neuromodulation across a large brain area while minimizing invasiveness. Building upon this motivation, the primary goal is to create an innovative distributed untethered framework that consists of an array of untethered mm-scale wirelessly powered implantable opto-electro stimulation (WIOES) devices. Each WIOES device will incorporate a flexible polyimide board that houses four planar recording electrodes and one LED along with an application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) via a passive carrier chip, all packed in a compact (smaller than one mm cube) and lightweight package. These WIOES devices placed on the brain surface will record electrocorticography (ECoG) and apply energy-efficient optical stimulation while being wirelessly powered and monitored by an external controller via a dual-band resonance-based inductive wireless link.

RT1 will be dedicated to developing the first compact neural implant smaller than one mm cube that has both optical stimulation and neural recording modalities. RT2 focuses on the development of a wireless and untethered neural interface system that relies on an innovative dual-band resonance-based inductive wireless link and an energy-efficient data communication protocol for wireless power and data transmission with the array of WIOES implants. RT3 aims to assess the functionality and reliability of the proposed distributed WIOES implants through a series of in vitro and in vivo tests. The successful completion of this CAREER project will establish a new paradigm for neural interfaces, offering unique features such as wireless and untethered operation, wide spatial coverage, and minimal invasiveness. This new paradigm will create new opportunities for neuroscience research and enable a deeper understanding of the brain.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This imposes high costs on the judiciary as an institution, and can be particularly harmful to defendants who have insecure employment situations, care-giving responsibilities, or lack transportation to court. These disparate impacts have profound negative effects. To address these issues, this project investigates Fair and Explainable Learning to Schedule, a novel approach that tightly integrates machine learning, constrained optimization, and knowledge representation to learn schedules with certifiable fairness guarantees and enable neuro-symbolic reasoning to provide meaningful and refinable explanations.

From medical implants to food packaging to green energy producing windmills, synthetic polymers offer enabling solutions to many of the world?s most demanding technical challenges. However, these materials are largely indestructible and are accumulating in the environment at an alarming rate. This research aims to develop an economically tractable approach to recycling polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene, which together constitute more than 60% of all plastics produced worldwide. Unlike aluminum and glass, few commercial plastics are recycled after use, representing a tragic waste of resources. One strategy for recycling is to blend these plastics together at elevated temperature followed by reformulation into useful products. Unfortunately, this results in brittle and mechanically inferior materials due to the inability of chemically different polymers to mix at a molecular level, leading to phase separation. Poor interfacial adhesion promotes cracks and bulk failure during mechanical deformation. This project will explore the synthesis of commercially viable block copolymers that can migrate to the interface when mixed with phase separated polymers, thereby stitching the plastic domains together and recovering the superior mechanical properties associated with the virgin materials. This research effort will result in the training of Ph.D. and undergraduate students, along with postdocs, in the field of polymer science and engineering, one of the largest segments of the chemical and materials industries in the United States. Interactions of the participants with the local community will inspire students, and their families, to embrace science and engineering for higher education and prospective careers.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>The crisis of plastic waste requires the development of new strategies for returning polyethylene (PE), polypropylene (iPP) and polystyrene (PS), representing more than 60% of all synthetic polymers, to product feed streams after use. One approach to recycling involves melt blending these plastics together, followed by formulation into useful items of commerce. This program will explore the synthesis of triblock and multiblock copolymers that localize at the phase separated domain interface, resulting in topological constraints and cocrystallization, which together create interfacial strength leading to mechanical properties competitive with the pure homopolymers. Butadiene and styrene will be polymerized anionically, and the polybutadiene blocks catalytically hydrogenated, yielding PE-PX, PS-PX, and PS-PE diblock, triblock and multiblock copolymers, where PX is a random copolymer containing approximately 90% ethylethylene and 10% ethylene repeat units. PX is melt miscible with iPP. Micelle formation and interfacial activity of these block copolymers with the respective pairs of homopolymers will be explored using small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS and SAXS), and atomic force and transmission electron microscopy (AFM and TEM). Blends will be formulated by melt mixing and evaluated in the solid state by tensile and impact testing. Interfacial adhesion will be quantified using peel tests. The overall goals of this program are to establish the dependence of blend ductility on: block copolymer molecular weight, composition, and architecture; block copolymer concentration; and processing conditions. This sustainability effort aims to create an economically viable approach to recycling the most prevalent commodity plastics.<br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The importance of modified peptidic organic molecules in chemistry, pharmacology, and agriculture cannot be overstated. These peptidic molecules are typically produced by genetically encoded enzymes acting upon a substrate peptide. The proposed project is aimed at the discovery and biochemical study of peptide modifying enzymes, and understanding how these enzymes recognize and bind to the substrate peptides. This pursuit will allow graduate students to gain valuable training in genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and analytical chemistry procedures. This project also aims at integrated curriculum innovation at the host institution wherein undergraduate students will receive theoretical and hands-on training in microbiology and analytical chemistry experiments with the aim to motivate their retention in postgraduate programs in science, thusly enriching the nation?s future technically trained workforce.<br/><br/>The enzymatic modification of peptides and proteins continues to furnish new chemical reactions. Starting with the mining of bacterial genomes and metagenomes, this project will reconstitute the biochemical activities of biosynthetic enzymes and query the reactions catalyzed by and the substrate scope for the peptide modifying enzymes. Of particular interest is the atomistic-level understanding of intermolecular peptide-protein interactions that underlie the above-mentioned chemical modifications. Using a variety of biophysical techniques, the mechanism of interactions between purified substrate peptides and purified modification enzymes will be queried. The biophysical studies will be corroborated with biochemical experiments, with the aim to develop a deeper understanding of the rules of intermolecular recognition. These efforts have the potential to provide new general-purpose biocatalysts that allow for tailored modification of peptidic substrates. Concomitantly, with material and personnel support from the host institution, new coursework for undergraduate students will be developed which will provide instruction in state-of-the-art mass spectrometry-based workflows aimed towards the discovery of peptidic natural products from bacterial sources, together with training in scientific communication and writing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An innovative aspect of this project is the close integration of experimental and mathematical analyses to investigate impacts of habitat fragmentation, interspecific competition, and predation on coexistence of species at patch and landscape levels. This research will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships that drive ecological systems and contribute to the development of effective conservation strategies. Two important questions regarding biology of interacting species are considered: 1) do predators affect the relationship between density and prey emigration, Allee effects and local or regional stability of prey species? and 2) does the presence of predators affect occurrence or strength of competition-dispersal, competition-reproduction or dispersal-reproduction tradeoffs and therefore coexistence of competitors? The project will also provide significant contributions towards analysis of mathematical models created to study this behavior via development of new tools to better understand model dynamics. Project results will be disseminated to the ecological and mathematical communities through various media including peer-reviewed mathematical and ecology journals and talks at national conferences. This project will involve training of graduate and undergraduate students through mentorship of independent research projects and PI-hosted workshops, with a session geared toward high-school students/teachers that focuses on illustrating value and applicability of mathematical models and ecological experiments to address societal problems. Moreover, an app that estimates key dispersal parameters from field data will be created and made publicly available.<br/><br/>This project combines reaction-diffusion models, mathematical analysis, and experimental research to investigate how habitat fragmentation, conditional dispersal, interspecific competition, and predation influence population dynamics and species coexistence at single patch to landscape scales. The project will involve the study of diffusive Lotka-Volterra competition and predator-prey systems with nonlinear boundary conditions designed to model how density dependent emigration (DDE) affects the dynamics of species at different spatial scales and experiments with two Tribolium flour beetle species and a shared natural enemy to measure DDE relationships and life-history tradeoffs under predation pressure. The Investigators will develop and analyze mathematical models based on the experimental data to explore effects of DDE on coexistence, invasion, and pattern formation. This project is expected to be novel and significant by providing (1) much-needed experimental evidence that interspecific competitors and predators affect boundary behavior namely, the strength and form of DDE, and important life-history tradeoffs linked to species coexistence; (2) the first theoretical framework for the effects of conditional dispersal on the population dynamics and coexistence of competing species and a shared predator in fragmented landscapes; and (3) a significant contribution toward the analysis of systems of elliptic boundary value problems with nonlinear boundary conditions, to better understand model dynamics.  Results from this study are expected to be applicable to conservation programs and reserve design. Specifically, this model framework can be used to investigate how Allee-like effects can arise from context-dependent dispersal to affect minimum patch sizes, carrying capacities, density-area relationships, species-area relationships, and multiple stable states.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the BIO Division of Environmental Biology through the Population and Community Ecology Cluster.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, existing methods ignore the imbalance's fundamental causes, metadata, such as demographics (e.g., gender and age), geolocation, and data sources. For example, given two cancers in a dataset, lung and breast cancers, while lung cancer is more frequent overall and in males, breast cancer occurs less frequently than lung cancer and more frequently in females, demonstrating imbalance patterns vary across metadata (gender in this case). Metadata includes essential information to describe the diversity and imbalance natures of health data. However, few studies have considered the diverse imbalance patterns across metadata factors, which has posed urgent needs and unique challenges in promoting robust and reliable imbalance modeling. This project proposes novel learning strategies that guide imbalance modeling by metadata and incorporate the varied imbalance patterns (e.g., breast cancer frequency for males and females) into training machine learning models. The general goal is to create reliable, open-source tools that other health researchers and practitioners can easily adopt. For example, one particular project outcome will be improving the machine learning classifiers for late effect assessments of pediatric cancer treatment at the St. Jude Children's Research Hospital. Materials (e.g., publications) and education activities will raise awareness and empower decision-making for health stakeholders with actional methods of developing and deploying machine learning on imbalanced healthcare data with rich and diverse metadata, such as demographics.<br/><br/>This project will create a novel metadata-guided imbalance-learning framework by meta-learning that can achieve reliable and robust machine learning across different metadata factors. The investigator will start with individual metadata at a time, develop novel extensions to joint imbalance learning across multiple metadata factors (e.g., gender and disease category), and propose a self-adapting weighting mechanism to balance different metadata and prevent meta-learning overfitting. Finally, the investigator will propose an unsupervised generative model to infer missing metadata attributes, which jointly works with the imbalance-learning framework. While the framework generally aims to promote model robustness, the method can also apply to demographic fairness due to its goals to achieve balance performance across demographic groups. This project will examine and evaluate the proposed framework on a variety of health data by 1) new settings on different metadata factors and 2) effects and sensitivities of metadata factors for imbalance learning. Specific deliverables include developing a novel meta-learning toolkit with broad utility and educational activities to train the next-generation computational healthcare workforce.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An innovative aspect of this project is the close integration of experimental and mathematical analyses to investigate impacts of habitat fragmentation, interspecific competition, and predation on coexistence of species at patch and landscape levels. This research will provide a more comprehensive understanding of the complex relationships that drive ecological systems and contribute to the development of effective conservation strategies. Two important questions regarding biology of interacting species are considered: 1) do predators affect the relationship between density and prey emigration, Allee effects and local or regional stability of prey species? and 2) does the presence of predators affect occurrence or strength of competition-dispersal, competition-reproduction or dispersal-reproduction tradeoffs and therefore coexistence of competitors? The project will also provide significant contributions towards analysis of mathematical models created to study this behavior via development of new tools to better understand model dynamics. Project results will be disseminated to the ecological and mathematical communities through various media including peer-reviewed mathematical and ecology journals and talks at national conferences. This project will involve training of graduate and undergraduate students through mentorship of independent research projects and PI-hosted workshops, with a session geared toward high-school students/teachers that focuses on illustrating value and applicability of mathematical models and ecological experiments to address societal problems. Moreover, an app that estimates key dispersal parameters from field data will be created and made publicly available.<br/><br/>This project combines reaction-diffusion models, mathematical analysis, and experimental research to investigate how habitat fragmentation, conditional dispersal, interspecific competition, and predation influence population dynamics and species coexistence at single patch to landscape scales. The project will involve the study of diffusive Lotka-Volterra competition and predator-prey systems with nonlinear boundary conditions designed to model how density dependent emigration (DDE) affects the dynamics of species at different spatial scales and experiments with two Tribolium flour beetle species and a shared natural enemy to measure DDE relationships and life-history tradeoffs under predation pressure. The Investigators will develop and analyze mathematical models based on the experimental data to explore effects of DDE on coexistence, invasion, and pattern formation. This project is expected to be novel and significant by providing (1) much-needed experimental evidence that interspecific competitors and predators affect boundary behavior namely, the strength and form of DDE, and important life-history tradeoffs linked to species coexistence; (2) the first theoretical framework for the effects of conditional dispersal on the population dynamics and coexistence of competing species and a shared predator in fragmented landscapes; and (3) a significant contribution toward the analysis of systems of elliptic boundary value problems with nonlinear boundary conditions, to better understand model dynamics.  Results from this study are expected to be applicable to conservation programs and reserve design. Specifically, this model framework can be used to investigate how Allee-like effects can arise from context-dependent dispersal to affect minimum patch sizes, carrying capacities, density-area relationships, species-area relationships, and multiple stable states.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the MPS Division of Mathematical Sciences (DMS) through the Mathematical Biology Program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the BIO Division of Environmental Biology through the Population and Community Ecology Cluster.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mineral scaling on surfaces, or the unwanted deposition of mineral precipitates, poses a technological challenge to many industrial processes. In membrane-based water treatment, mineral scaling of polymer membranes decreases membrane flux, diminishes energy efficiency, and shortens membrane module lifespan. In the oil and gas industry, mineral scale deposition on the interior surface of pipes can result in complete blockage of pipelines and disrupt oil and gas production. Despite its importance, the role of polymeric solid substrates on mineral scaling is poorly understood.  This research aims to understand how the surface characteristics of polymers impact the formation of mineral scales. The investigators will employ combined experimental characterization and theoretical analysis to examine the nanoscale interactions that drive mineral scale formation on polymeric substrates. The findings of this work will inform design of anti-scaling polymer surfaces in submerged aqueous environments, which will bring significant economic benefits to industries in which mineral scaling plagues system performance and long-term durability. This research project will provide outreach activities  through public engagement at both George Washington University and University of Maryland. The investigators will host a yearly student-run symposium on environmental nanoscience, and host high school student interns and deliver guest lectures to local high school students. <br/><br/>Mineral scaling on surfaces, or the unwanted deposition of mineral precipitates, is a ubiquitous yet unwanted phenomenon in many industrial processes including reverse osmosis, water desalination, heat exchangers, and oil and gas production. One promising strategy for mitigating scaling is to modify polymer surface characteristics or apply polymer coatings to non-polymer surfaces to render the surface scaling resistant. Currently, there is a significant knowledge gap in understanding the nanoscale interactions and physicochemical processes in the initial stages of scale formation on polymers. This knowledge gap limits rational development of scaling-resistant membranes and surface polymer coatings. In this research, the investigators will integrate liquid phase transmission electron microscopy, real-time measurement of scale formation dynamics using quartz crystal microbalance, and theoretical modeling to establish nucleation mechanisms during scaling of silica and gypsum on polyamide surfaces. The research objectives are to 1) investigate the effect of surface charge and hydrophobicity of polyamide films prepared via molecular layer-by-layer assembly on mineral scaling rate, 2) employ liquid phase transmission electron microscopy  to visualize and quantify mineral nucleation dynamics on polyamide surfaces in real time at the nanometer length scale and 3) derive theoretical models for nanoparticle attachment and nucleation kinetics to identify the nanoscale interactions involved in scale formation as a function of polymer surface chemistry. The results of this work will facilitate rational manipulation of nanoscale mineral-membrane interactions to prevent mineral scaling on engineering polymers in the aqueous environment. Educational and outreach aspects of the project will incorporate research findings into undergraduate and graduate course materials, host joint student-run nanomaterial and water symposia, and enhance the participation of underrepresented students in research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This condition massively increases risk for cardiovascular diseases associated with high rates of morbidity and mortality. Current noninvasive approaches lack effective and targeted damage repair. Light therapy, when administered through a particular radiation mode, can extract significant advantages, and thus, is often considered a noninvasive therapeutic approach in regenerative medicine. Nanostructures made from materials with magnetic properties are attractive possibilities for designing novel platforms for similar applications. Thus, it may be possible to enhance the effectiveness of these approaches by aptly combining the optical and the magnetic excitation for tissue repair. In this project, the PI will use simultaneous optical-magnetic stimulation to the targeted cells in combination with the delivery of energy-harvesting nanodevices to create a novel therapeutic approach. The knowledge derived from this research will directly contribute towards reliable platforms for high-throughput screening of pharmaceutical or toxicological agents and their effects on cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, the societal impacts are broad since this research derived technique will be useful to release a combination of therapeutic agents plus infection preventing molecules simultaneously from a drug reservoir. In the middle of an ongoing pandemic or in future situations like this, where infection prevention is of supreme importance in conjunction with the critical care, this will be extremely useful to conduct efficacy assessment on selected drugs. The project, due to its inter-disciplinary nature, will involve students from multiple fields of science and technology. Students, especially those under-represented within STEM fields, will be recruited, and supported to boost the research and innovation culture of the institution.  The students involved in the project will be  exposed to a wide range of perspectives and ideas, thus fostering diversity. <br/><br/>Chronic oxidative stress exposure of the endothelium leading to depletion of intracellular energy and, therefore, induction of apoptosis, which massively increases the risk for cardiovascular diseases, is a significant health problem. Mechanisms to re-establish normal endothelium functioning and induce cell growth and proliferation following chronic oxidative damage are complex and still not well understood. The understanding of these processes is important towards comprehensive control to treat the diseases that involve endothelium damage. Introduction of combinatorial therapeutics consisting of synergistic photo-magnetic stimulation, and multifunctional nanoscale energy-harvesting devices that are biocompatible, remotely tunable, and capable of performing on-demand release of a specific drug or a combination of drugs to the targeted cells can revolutionize the treatment outcomes for diseases that involve endothelium damage. This research, by implementing an innovative multimodal comprehensive strategy that has been unexplored thus far ? hybrid photo-magnetic stimulation ? will focus on synergistically modulating the intracellular pathways to restore homeostatic functioning of the endothelium following the induction of oxidative stress. In this project, the primary objectives will be: (a) Introduce molecular level energy-harvesting devices to provide photo-magnetic and chemical cues; (b) Determine whether the combinatorial photo-magnetic therapy can restore homeostatic functioning of the endothelium following induction of oxidative stress; and (c) Explore the cellular and molecular mechanism(s) by which the photo-magnetic combinatorial therapeutics would reverse the endothelium damage. Opto-magnetically responsive nanodevices will be encapsulated within a thermo-activated poly(ethylene glycol) based biopolymer network, which is non-toxic, and anti-immunogenic. The energy-harvesting devices will be targeted to cells by derivatizing the polymer shell with ligands for specific plasma membrane receptors. The cell-bound nanodevices, when placed inside the hybrid photo-magnetic excitation exposure, will perform the controlled release of small molecules that activate signal transduction pathways leading to endothelium damage repair, and convert the excitation energy to chemical potential for Adenosine triphosphate synthesis. Additionally, the hybrid photo-magnetic excitation strategy will permit the use of a less intense alternating current magnetic field in combination with optical stimulation during the irradiation process, thus removing the safety concerns associated with using only alternating current magnetic field assisted therapies. A unique approach of nanodevice and chemical cues integration with an opto-magnetic excitation strategy for endothelium damage repair will stimulate several technical fields, including cardiovascular disease monitoring, high-throughput screening of pharmaceutical or toxicological agents, and identification of potential effects on endothelium damage.  The primary educational benefit of this project will be the interactions and direct participation of students at Southeast Missouri State University. Educational and outreach activities include training students  in advanced instrumentation and conducting cross-listed courses, involving upper-level undergraduate and graduate students. In addition, research and educational activities of the project will be integrated with the current undergraduate educational efforts of the Ronald F. McNair post-baccalaureate achievement initiative at Southeast, which promotes research experiences among members of students under-represented in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project?s community-centered recruitment pathway and continued support that includes a professional learning community targeting pre-collegiate, prospective, early career, and veteran STEM teachers has the potential of becoming a sustainable mechanism to support the continued development of diverse STEM educators committed to teaching STEM for equity and justice in their communities. The necessity to adapt equity- and justice-seeking instructional practices to fit the realities of secondary STEM teaching is a primary focus of this work, and it is predicted that leveraging the strengths inherent in a diverse community of experiences, backgrounds, and knowledge will be essential for overcoming recruitment, development, and retention challenges. The project will evaluate the successes and challenges of the community-centered pathway in meeting project goals and disseminate results in district professional development workshops, district leadership meetings, STEM education conferences, and research journals.

Face-to-face human contacts, financial transactions, and computer communications can all be viewed as temporal networks where interactions are active only at certain points in time. Analyzing such networks is important for various applications such as maintaining cyber-secure environments in the context of national security. Another example, in the context of a client-server network of interactions, is determining whether there is a set of servers that interact with clients in an unusually coordinated way. In the context of money laundering, the lifeblood of criminal activities and a source of damages to economic competitiveness in the U.S., can we detect the accounts involved in coordinated cryptocurrency laundering while also performing licit transactions? This project devises a new paradigm for analyzing temporal networks effectively and efficiently and trains next-generation of computer scientists from diverse backgrounds by increasing public scientific engagement, performing outreach to marginalized communities, and course development. In particular, the investigator organizes workshops to reach high-school students from Hispanic, Burmese, and Somalis communities in the Buffalo area to inform and educate them about the basics of computer science and network science. Outputs, such as an open-source software framework for temporal network analysis and know-how on critical applications such as intrusion detection and anti-money laundering, are designed to advance and contribute to scientific understanding in various disciplines such as cybersecurity, economics, finance, and social network analysis.<br/><br/>This project designs and develops motif-based models and algorithms to analyze and process temporal networks. It will devise generic formalizations in a bottom-up approach by first building primitives in the microscale, then analyzing the subgraphs and periodicity in the mesoscale, and lastly extending the techniques for graphs encountered in real-world applications. This project broadens the knowledge with new models and algorithms that can work on temporal networks with fine resolution and a large timespan. To this end, there are two main research thrusts: (1) a framework for temporal motif analysis; and (2) mesoscale structures and graphs in the wild. The investigator performs theoretical and empirical evaluations for all the proposed models and algorithms. In particular, this project considers two real-world applications in collaboration with industry and government research labs; (1) intrusion detection in bipartite cyber logs; and (2) anti-money laundering in financial and cryptocurrency transactions. This project will make contributions to the fields of graph mining and network science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The choice of iron complexes as the catalysts for these methods is rooted in their ability to interact with the three coupling partners in a controlled fashion, each at a specific stage of the reaction pathway. The catalysts of interest have the added benefit of being based on the most abundant transition metal in the Earth?s crust, as well as one of the least expensive and least toxic, accentuating the sustainability and potential practical utility of the processes under development. The broader impacts of the funded project will extend to providing evidence that the distinct behavior of Earth-abundant metals can complement the reactivity of the rare precious metals that are more commonly deployed in current transition metal-catalyzed technology. Students participating in the funded research will gain a comprehensive education encompassing all aspects of transition metal catalysis, providing them with the capacity to become knowledgeable and insightful contributors to the scientific community. The activities supported by the award include outreach efforts directed toward establishing an undergraduate summer research program for students from minority groups underrepresented in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) from the Saint Louis area.<br/><br/>The funded research is focused on the development of iron-catalyzed three-component coupling reactions of nitrene precursors (e.g., azides), alkynes, and nitrile or isonitrile substrates for the synthesis of value-added, nitrogen-containing compounds. The methods under investigation capitalize on [2+2] cycloaddition reactivity of sterically congested iron imide complexes that is highly sensitive to the nature of the alkyne substrate, allowing for the incorporation of unsymmetrical alkynes with high regioselectivity. Reactions of nitrile coupling partners will provide a general and modular route to imidazoles, a pervasive structural motif in biologically active compounds, with further application to the preparation of diversely substituted N-heterocyclic carbenes. Early efforts in imidazole formation will focus on translating the stoichiometric behavior observed in preliminary studies to catalytic reactivity, with later work aimed at optimizing reaction conditions and exploring the scope of the process with respect to each of the three substrates. Iron-catalyzed coupling using isonitriles will be explored to access imidoyl ketenimine products that have broad utility as synthetic intermediates. Initial stoichiometric studies will target conditions that favor three-component coupling over a competing process identified in preliminary experiments.

Examples of such solutions include the temperature distribution in a body, electromagnetic fields, and gravitational fields. One of the tools in the analysis of solutions to elliptic equations is the so-called frequency function, which describes the local complexity of the solution. The overreaching goal of the project is to understand how the frequency function controls various local characteristics of the solution and its gradient. The work on quantitative properties of solutions of elliptic equations has numerous applications in other areas of mathematics, including spectral geometry, geometric measure theory, control theory, and mathematical physics. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students. The principal investigator (PI) is active in disseminating the new ideas and results obtained as part of this project through series of lectures and minicourses on the frequency function method. As an educational initiative within this project, the PI will prepare an expository article based on these series of lectures. <br/><br/>The frequency function was introduced by Almgren and was applied to quantitative unique continuation for solutions of elliptic equations by Garofalo and Lin. Recent progress in the understanding of the behavior of the frequency function led to a proof of Nadirashvili's conjecture and a partial solution of Yau's conjecture. These results and the geometric combinatorial method on which they are based open up new possibilities in the study of analytic, geometric, and topological properties of solutions to second order elliptic PDE. One of the goals of the project concerns the study of solutions to elliptic equations with bounded frequency and their applications to Laplace eigenfunctions, which includes restriction estimates and localization properties of eigenfunctions. Another goal is to introduce a new framework to study random harmonic functions of bounded frequency and investigate the typical behavior of such functions. For a number of deterministic questions on the behavior of solutions of elliptic PDE that are currently out of reach, the PI studies the typical behavior of the corresponding random solutions defined by taking random combinations of the Steklov eigenfunctions with independent Gaussian coefficients.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although many of the problems studied as part of the project are centered around noteworthy questions in SPDEs, a successful resolution of these problems will likely also help study other complex systems. The developed ideas and techniques are expected to have sufficient novelty to open new research areas, solve a number of long-standing open problems and promote further applicability of the theory of SPDEs.

Adams State University?s project will examine the effects of place-based high-impact experiences and cost-of-attendance scholarships on developing effective STEM teachers in high-need schools. Using the excitement of astronomy and rural dark skies, collaborative math and science circles, STEM Saturdays, and a summer academy for migrant students, this project aims to inspire prospective and practicing teachers to develop new approaches in STEM teaching and learning and generate P-20 enthusiasm for careers in K-12 STEM education. This model has the potential to increase the number of students completing STEM degrees with teaching licensure from a single Adams State student to eight per year. Increased representation of underserved groups among rural teachers to improve equity in access to STEM education and careers for students of color and those who are low-income is a priority outcome. <br/><br/><br/>This project at Adams State University, a Hispanic-Serving Institution, includes partnerships with five high-need local school districts and the San Luis Valley Board of Cooperative Educational Services to address the need for STEM teachers across the rural San Luis Valley. Project goals include implementing astronomy-themed activities, hands-on workshops, mentoring, and other collaborative STEM programming to engage prospective teachers as innovators and leaders. These high-impact experiences and annual scholarships aim to inspire 31 undergraduate STEM majors (e.g., in mathematics, physics, chemistry, biology, and geosciences) and post-baccalaureates to complete degrees and teaching licensure in 4 years. Engaging K-12 students and prospective teachers with local assets, such as ASU?s planetarium and observatory and the dark skies of Great Sand Dunes National Park, have the potential to attract and retain students as they develop their passion for STEM studies and teaching. The project?s research questions focus on the impacts of this intentional P-20 STEM ecosystem of local resources and supportive activities, which aim to validate students? focus on STEM and grow their identities as effective teachers, leaders, and future mentors working in high-need districts. This pilot effort will generate knowledge on identity development of students in STEM education and add to the evidence on closing gaps in the representation of ethnic and racial minorities and females in STEM fields. Successful strategies will provide a model that other Hispanic-Serving Institutions and school districts may replicate. An evaluator will review institutional and survey data to monitor progress in objectives attainment and inform improvements.

PFAS molecules are collectively known as ?forever chemicals? because they do not break down naturally in the environment and can accumulate in water, soil, and sources of food. Given the health risks posed by such forever chemicals, new methods are urgently needed for removing PFAS contamination from our waterways. To address this problem, the research team will develop nanostructured, highly porous materials that are also photocatalytically active, enabling the simultaneous adsorption and degradation of PFAS to convert them to benign products. Specifically, the team is developing photochemically-active covalent organic frameworks (COFs) for removal of PFAS from water. COFs are fully organic macromolecules with a honeycomb-like molecular structure, and the Rice scientists will seek to engineer these materials to interact strongly with PFAS for both adsorption and photochemical degradation. This project has the potential to advance the development of low-cost approaches for remediating PFAS-contaminated water, toward ultimately developing sustainable and economically viable approaches for water treatment. The project also will establish new outreach activities. The PIs will host students from a local community college to provide hands-on laboratory experience for students who otherwise would have limited research opportunities. The PIs also will work with teachers from a local high school through a Research Experiences for Teachers (RET) program at Rice University, which will produce high-quality learning modules to bolster K-12 STEM education in the Houston area.<br/><br/>Under this project, Drs. Senftle and Verduzco and their team will apply computational and experimental methods to develop covalent organic frameworks (COFs) as photocatalysts for the degradation of poly- and perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS). The modular nature of COFs offers several avenues for tuning their interactions with PFAS molecules, which can be used to enhance adsorption and control catalytic degradation mechanisms. The group will study a series of COF structures with variations in backbone and side-chain functionalization, which is expected to enhance to provide knowledge of the structure-property relationships that govern photocatalytic PFAS degradation mechanisms in COFs. The combined use of simulation and experiment is expected to lead to an improved understanding of the physical mechanisms that influence COF performance both as an adsorbent and a photocatalyst. Studies will focus on clarifying the influence of optoelectronic properties at the electronic scale to better understanding molecular diffusion and adsorption at the atomic scale.

However, teacher education programs vary in how pre-service teachers are prepared to use culturally relevant instruction. Also, little is known about how beginning teachers apply these teaching approaches in mathematics teaching in elementary school classrooms. This project will explore how teacher education programs differ in their approaches to preparing elementary school teachers for culturally relevant mathematics teaching. The project will also investigate how teachers? use of culturally relevant instruction influences their instructional effectiveness, student mathematics learning, and teacher retention in the profession.

The experienced research team aims to conduct a longitudinal, mixed-method research design that will, over three years, investigate a sample of 200 elementary school teachers. Teachers will include those working in minority-serving schools and prepared at minority-serving institutions. Investigations will span teachers' experiences during their final year of teacher preparation through their first two years of teaching. The research team will collect evidence about participating teachers? opportunities to learn culturally relevant teaching and their attitudes towards culturally relevant teaching over time. Additionally, the research will collect classroom observation evidence to explore how teachers apply culturally relevant teaching practices in the context of their mathematics teaching, as well as access data on elementary school students? mathematics learning outcomes. The research will use structural equation modelling to explore key mediating and moderating factors to understand how teacher education experiences influence beginning teachers? effectiveness and retention. Further, the research will benefit from input and evaluation by an advisory board that includes experts in culturally relevant teaching, mathematics teaching and learning, and quantitative research methods.

This CAREER program will explore the potential of systems containing more than two objects (i.e., multi-body systems) to lead to new physical and transport behaviors and, as a result, enable new applications in domains of national importance such as aerospace electronics, energy conversion technology, and information processing. To create these new technologies, it is essential to experimentally study and understand nanoscale radiative heat transfer between multiple objects and explore its use for improving heat exchange and thermal control. Thus, a primary outcome of this research will be a novel technique that enables the study of nanoscale radiative heat transfer among multiple objects. In addition to providing the fundamental knowledge necessary to advance thermal control at the nanoscale, this program will implement an innovative educational platform that promotes practical workforce development in academia by bridging the gap between academic work and industrial problems and stimulates curiosity among K-12 students in exploring engineering careers. <br/><br/>This CAREER program will apply the physics of radiative transport in multi-bodies to solve thermal control problems in nanodevices. Specifically, this research will experimentally uncover the governing physics that drive electromagnetic waves-matter interactions in multi-body systems to identify the contributing factors in near-field radiative heat transfer (NFRHT). This work will provide new knowledge critical to the development of next-generation nanodevices by: (1) understanding the effect of structural factors on NFRHT in multi-bodies and (2) elucidating the role of multi-body physics in NFRHT for active thermal management. Significant structural and material factors in the spatial confinement of evanescent photons between multi-bodies will be identified through precision heat transfer measurements.

Understanding the transformation between nitrogen and ammonia offers a potential carbon-free fuel cycle to interconvert chemical and electrical energy. The project will focus on the synthesis of new catalysts using inexpensive metals such as chromium, iron, and nickel. By design, the novel behavior of these catalysts will be used to both form ammonia and convert ammonia to nitrogen. The project will establish strategies for the interconversion of nitrogen and ammonia by removing and attaching hydrogen atoms using chemical reagents, electricity, and/or light energy in conjunction with the metal catalysts. Additionally, the Mock group will host Native American undergraduate students from Montana Tribal Colleges to work in the laboratory to learn about synthetic chemistry and catalysis, and to acquire hands-on laboratory skills. Providing hands-on experience in chemistry to Native American students will serve to increase the involvement of underrepresented minorities in chemistry and will contribute to strengthening the technical workforce in Montana and in the United States. This project will enable outreach activities at area primary and secondary schools to engage students on the topics of renewable forms of energy and new energy technologies.  Science outreach activities at area schools will engage students on the topics of renewable forms of energy and new energy technologies that have a positive impact on the environment and society.    <br/><br/>Under this project, Professor Michael Mock of Montana State University is studying molecular catalytic systems to develop a nitrogen-based cycle to store and utilize energy in N?H bonds.

The Developing Identities in STEM to Cultivate Opportunities that Validate, Empower, and Retain Teachers project, a.k.a. DISCOVER, intends to address some of the barriers related to STEM education for youth in the Commonwealth of Virginia, including that academic achievement in science and subsequent matriculation in STEM career fields has been limited for many students, particularly those of color and low-income youth. The DISCOVER project will present a four-year pathway for prospective teachers beginning with extensive, broad-based, and far-reaching recruitment initiatives, aimed at increasing diversity among secondary STEM teachers. Teacher candidates will be supported in exploring teaching through in- and out-of-the-classroom experiences and engaging in navigated community building and customized coursework to better know and understand the unique context and challenges of high-need schools. DISCOVER will increase prospective teachers? understanding of the nature of science and mathematics to better prepare them to work with culturally, ethnically and linguistically diverse students.  <br/><br/>This project at the University of Mary Washington (UMW) in collaboration with Germanna Community College includes partnerships with Fredericksburg City and Orange, Spotsylvania, and Stafford County public schools. Project goals include cultivating Scholars? identities in their STEM discipline and preparing Scholars to exhibit cultural competency awareness to effectively teach STEM curricula. DISCOVER will provide scholarships to 18 undergraduates pursuing baccalaureate degrees in a STEM discipline over five years who will be supported in learning evidence-based educational practices and become certified as secondary teachers. Four objectives will guide the project. First is to recruit from a broad base to expand diversity among the STEM teaching population. Second is to increase prospective teachers? understanding of STEM to have sound disciplinary teaching identities. Third is to provide opportunities for prospective teachers to work with individuals from diverse backgrounds with varied aptitudes/attitudes toward STEM. Fourth and finally is to enhance prospective teachers? abilities to understand and promote healthy attitudes towards STEM and foster STEM literacy through classroom instruction and public engagement. This project will study the effect of increased and deliberate attention to the connections between content and pedagogy on the quality of STEM teaching, particularly in high-need schools. Further, this project will investigate how an increased STEM-specific focus on culturally responsive pedagogy impacts the cultural competency of STEM teachers. DISCOVER will add to an improved understanding of how exploring STEM teaching as a career option in the first years of an undergraduate program and coordinating with community colleges by establishing a robust professional learning community has the potential to lead to an increase in the number of STEM teachers. The involvement of STEM faculty in recruiting, advising, and mentoring roles is an impactful initiative of DISCOVER. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But much about how humans process color is still a mystery. A better understanding of human color vision has many practical applications in imaging, materials and textiles, architecture and lighting design. Many of these models are only loosely tied to basic human color mechanisms, in part because of a lack of good models of fundamental color processes. The human brain contains millions of nerve cells that respond when an event occurs in the environment.  For visual stimuli, the neural responses start in the retina of the eye and are transmitted to the brain where they create our conscious awareness of the world around us. Among other things, the neural activity signals the color of the light.   This process is fast, but not instantaneous.  This project uses novel procedures to measure behavioral responses that are triggered by color in the very first fraction of a second of nerve activity in the eye and study how those responses change over time over a range of colors, contrasts, and adapting backgrounds.<br/> <br/>This research uses innovative psychophysical methods to explore how light adaptation and the bifurcation of neural visual signals underlie chromatic detection and color categorization.  One goal is to explore whether the fastest behavioral responses are triggered by the very early activity in the light-sensitive cells of the retina of the eye.  A second goal rests on the hypothesis that neural responses to the start and end of a stimulus are carried in two different nerve pathways to the brain (the ON and OFF pathways). The aim is to test whether the ON and OFF responses can be measured and studied separately, by determining whether responses triggered by the start and end of a stimulus can have different colors even though the physical stimulus is the same for both.  Results from all experiments will be analyzed using advanced computational methods and compared with the known properties of nerve cells in the eye.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new materials will be of broad importance as they are intended to teach the process of scientific reasoning and data visualization across a range of science, technology, engineering, and math courses. Curriculum materials will feature the early 20th century work of the foundational Black social scientist, W.E.B. Du Bois who pioneered data visualization techniques that are still considered state of the art across science disciplines. Additionally, centering the scholarly work of Du Bois is of importance as he investigated the social causes of racial inequality and promoted empowerment of Black scholars in ways that were accessible for broad audiences. The project team plans to include faculty and students from multiple institutions and science disciplines to contribute to curriculum development and participate in testing its impact. The project intends to measure how the curriculum influences undergraduate student learning, sense of belonging in science, and persistence in science. Curricular materials and study results will be widely shared in an open, online repository, which could benefit large numbers of students and faculty in undergraduate science courses across the country. <br/><br/>The project aims to develop, implement, and assess the Du Bois curriculum module that could be implemented in a variety of science courses during three, 50-minute class or laboratory sessions, along with three homework assignments. Undergraduate students will be engaged in exploring the scholarly work of Du Bois in data science, using data analysis and visualization techniques employed by Du Bois with domain-appropriate data for their particular disciplinary course, and completing metacognitive written reflections on their learning. The curriculum will be developed in collaboration with science faculty and students at each of the three partner institutions ? a Hispanic Serving Institution, a Historically Black College and University where Du Bois earned a degree, and a top-ranked, Ivy League and Primarily White Institution ? each of which has unique student populations. Developed curriculum will be piloted in 40 courses reaching over 1,600 students across the three collaborating institutions. The project will test the hypothesis that implementation of this inclusive curriculum can promote science learning and sense of belonging among undergraduate students, in particular fostering positive science associations and reducing stigma associated with scientists from marginalized backgrounds. Investigation of curriculum impact will use a pre/post-assessment design and published assessment tools that have evidence of validity for measuring constructs such as: 1) belonging, 2) positive (stereotype boost) vs stigmatized (stereotype threat) associations with racial and ethnic identity and scientist identity, stereotypes, and relatability, and 3) self-efficacy. Further, the project will collect assessment evidence in course offerings that use the module intervention as well as in course offerings that do not, enabling direct analyses to test for shifts in student assessments over time that are associated with the intervention. The project has strong potential to advance understanding of how development and implementation of curriculum highlighting the accomplishments of scientists from marginalized groups might promote student success and retention, while also integrating the teaching of science concepts and social justice. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

Some of these intraplate volcanoes, such as those in Hawaii, are linked to hot mantle that flows upward from depths of more than 2500 km in the lower mantle. Others, however, have more enigmatic origins. One group of volcanoes in the enigmatic category erupt lavas whose chemistry is consistent with melting of rocks at depths of 410 km to 660 km. The New Zealand Auckland Volcanic Field is an example of this type of volcanic zone. The goal of this project is to image the melting region for these volcanos. This will be carried out by measuring the properties of the mantle beneath the North Island of New Zealand and the surrounding ocean using seismic waves from distant earthquakes recorded by seismometers on the ocean floor and on land. These results will be combined with numerical models and geochemical measurements to understand origins of these volcanic rocks. Broader impacts include support for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The goal of this study is to develop a better global understanding of the processes that produce intraplate volcanism by resolving the origins of the Holocene Auckland Volcanic Field (AVF). The AVF is spatially separated from the subduction zone arc, and its magmas do not bear obvious contributions from subduction-related melting. Neither are these magmas clearly connected to a lower mantle plume, based on existing seismic tomography and helium isotopes. Rather, geochemical data raise the possibility that the AVF magmas provide a global end-member case of mantle melting that emanates from transition zone depths, a class of intraplate volcanism that has recently emerged. However, other processes such as melting driven by upwelling related to lithospheric instabilities and small-scale convection cannot be ruled out, and even upwelling from the lower mantle needs to be further evaluated. New seismic data will be collected from a temporary array of 20 US seafloor broadband seismometers (OBSs). These stations will be complemented by New Zealand-based land arrays, and an OBS deployment from SUSTech (China). With the proposed array, seismic analyses will test for the presence or absence of seismic velocity and attenuation anomalies, transition zone discontinuity topography, and seismic anisotropy associated with the competing hypotheses. US work will be integrated with seismological and volcanological analyses by New Zealand collaborators and a SUSTech geodynamical modeling effort. Results from this synthesis will provide estimates of the depth extent of melting, volatile ascent, and the degree to which this intraplate volcanism is driven by processes in the lithosphere, transition zone, or both. A range of critical questions will be addressed, including: What is the thermal structure from surface to transition-zone depths? Does upwelling occur, and from what depth, and are lithospheric instabilities present? What pathways do fluids and melt take as they ascend, and how do those pathways interact with large-scale flow? How does volcanism far behind the arc interact with the subduction system, if at all? This project will support graduate and undergraduate students at Cornell and Brown. Results from the project will be incorporated in the outreach and teaching activities of the PIs. The proposed project will enhance international collaborations. The project will provide a better understanding of the deep drivers for volcanic hazards, including young (<1 ka) volcanism within the Auckland urban area.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Marine Geology and Geophysics program in the Division of Ocean Sciences and the Geophysics program in the Division of Earth Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has been conjectured and partially proved that all models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class exhibit the same limiting behaviors. Understanding these behaviors has become an important area in probability theory and more generally in mathematics. The awardee mentors graduate and undergraduate students and is engaged in educational outreach.<br/><br/>The height functions of models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class are expected to converge to a limiting space-time fluctuation field, which is called the KPZ fixed point. Moreover, there is a random directed metric on the space-time plane that is expected to govern all the models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class. This directed metric is called the directed landscape. While both the KPZ fixed point and the directed landscape are central to the study of the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, they have only been characterized very recently. The project aims to study these random fields using the approach of exact formulas. The research will first focus on finding  exact formulas for the limiting fields in certain exactly solvable models in the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang universality class, such as the directed last passage percolation; these formulas can be used to understand probabilistic properties of the limiting fields.

As thaw progresses, a well-drained landscape with a maze of tiny surface drainages may form. This dense network of small channels represents the capillaries of the Arctic hydrologic system and serves as the originators of the water that feeds large rivers. An expanding capillary hydrologic system may change habitat for wildlife due to an overall drying of the tundra landscape, increased river runoff, and through more nutrients exported from terrestrial to aquatic environments. Further, an expanding capillary hydrological network that is identifiable from sub-meter resolution satellite imagery can serve as an indicator of ice-rich permafrost thaw and, therefore, warn of hazard to infrastructure. The development and expansion of a surface drainage system may also decrease the likelihood of moss to thrive, which results in loss of a vegetation cover that effectively cools the ground and preserves the upper permafrost from thawing. The project will produce a pan-Arctic map of the capillary hydrological system and in selected areas, advance understanding of how the capillary system has changed over time. The geospatial products will be made publicly accessible on the Permafrost Discovery Gateway to enable discovery and knowledge-generation by scientists, stakeholders, and the public.<br/><br/>Field observations have shown that runoff from many Arctic rivers has increased in recent decades. Simultaneously, several studies have documented ice wedge degradation across the Arctic, and a handful of local field and remote sensing studies in Northern Alaska have shown that the capillary hydrologic system is expanding due to partial melting of ice wedges. This project aims to map the extent of the capillary hydrologic system across the pan-Arctic tundra and assess the role of the capillary system in generating water flow and lateral carbon flux to large rivers. Graph analysis techniques applied to the pan-Arctic ice-wedge polygon map, as well as deep learning/AI algorithms trained to detect a capillary system from very high spatial resolution satellite imagery, will allow the network of ice wedges and the capillary hydrologic system to be mapped across the Arctic tundra. Field measurements in northern and northwestern Alaska will include geochemical water sampling, coring of permafrost to assess ice-wedge status (degradation or stabilization), and ground-truthing for the remote sensing hydrologic network analyses. This new information will inform a numerical hydrology model to quantify how important the capillaries are in contributing freshwater and carbon flows to the Arctic Ocean. Earlier hydrological model experiments have shown that the formation of connected troughs-networks can double the runoff from the landscape even if the rain and snowfall amounts remain unchanged. The pan-Arctic map of hydrological capillaries will support a first study on how important sub-meter wide channels are to large Arctic river runoff.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Spatial resolution of biomedical images, however, sometimes do not suffice for specific applications due to constraints of image acquisition time. Conventional software-based improvement bears high costs in computation and visualization, opening a niche to optimize the framework towards super-resolution at reasonable costs. It aligns with NSF?s mission to promote the process of computer science and to advance the national health. This project is to investigate novel algorithm development to adaptively improve digital resolution and minimize the cost of computation in super-resolution process. Technically, this method combines the effort of object detection and super-resolution to bring a generalizable tool to potentially benefit multiple biomedical imaging modalities, such as optical coherence tomography (OCT), histological microscopy, confocal images, MRI, ultrasound, etc. The educational emphasizes activities to broaden the participation of underrepresented groups in biomedical pursuits.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop intelligent object-adaptive super-resolution algorithms to improve resolutions of biomedical images in a robust, efficient, and generalizable manner. This project will develop robust object detection neural network to identify regions to be super-resolved. A scale factor will be determined for adaptive super-resolution. This project will investigate on computationally efficient algorithms to super-resolve biomedical images to multiple scale factors during a complex-valued image reconstruction process.  This project will also develop a transferrable framework such that the super-resolution technology developed in one image modality can be adapted into the super-resolution technology developed by a different imaging modality. The approaches will be validated using OCT data and the domain adaption will be validated by transferring from OCT domain to histopathological domain. The research outcome will also result in artificial intelligence-based educational materials and software to reduce the need of biomedical facilities that are conventionally required but not cost-effective to underrepresented groups. In addition, this project includes outreach activities to promote biomedical participation in regions with limited access to biomedical resources and a new model to mentor a diverse and inclusive team and create motivation to the next generation of researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Curiosity is a hallmark of scientific discovery and can propel students to ask questions, explore scientific ideas, enhance memory, and boost persistence during learning. Yet, studies of curiosity have mostly focused on whether curiosity increases learning rather than how curiosity increases learning. Therefore, to understand how curiosity impacts learning about scientific phenomena, this project will conduct a set of three studies with high school and undergraduate students to test whether sparking curiosity about scientific phenomena changes students? visual processing. These experiments will test whether feeling curious changes visual processing in ways that support student learning about science. This project will also develop citizen science projects to engage K-12 students in cognitive science research about curiosity and visual processing. Results from this project will contribute to understandings of curiosity and visual processing, provide recommendations for future interventions to increase the positive impact of curiosity, and will be the first to examine relations between curiosity and visual processing during science learning. The project is supported by a CAREER award to American University by the EHR Core Research (ECR) program, which supports work that advances the fundamental research literature on STEM learning.<br/><br/>Within educational research, it is clear that both motivational processes, such as curiosity, and cognitive processes, such as visual-spatial thinking, support student learning across STEM fields. The potential relations among motivational and cognitive processes are well-articulated at the theoretical level. However, empirical research studies in education have not yet maximized the potential for cognitive science methods such as eye-tracking to elucidate these relations, and cognitive science research has tended to utilize domain-general stimuli (e.g., trivia facts, faces) to investigate intersection of motivation/emotion and cognition during learning. Therefore, the central question of this project is: How does curiosity shape visual processing when students use visuals to learn about scientific phenomena? To investigate this question, this project will conduct a set of eye-tracking and behavioral studies to investigate the specific ways curiosity modulates cognitive correlates of visual processing. In these studies, high school and undergraduate students will learn about scientific phenomena using visuals such as maps and diagrams. Study 1 will experimentally manipulate curiosity using a question-asking intervention. Studies 2 and 3 will examine within-subject fluctuations in curiosity as students are exposed to visuals about scientific phenomena designed to spark or resolve curiosity. As brain regions implicated in curiosity-driven reward processing (i.e., dopaminergic circuits) are also associated with a range of visual processes including visual information-seeking and mental imagery formation, this project will target these visual processes as potential mediators to explain why students learn better when they feel curious. Because these findings will provide insight into how (rather than just whether) curiosity supports learning about science, the proposed research will generate specific recommendations for the types of science learning tasks that would benefit most from supporting curiosity. Knowing that, for instance, curiosity impacts learning by supporting visual information seeking more than by enhancing mental imagery (or vice versa), has implications for identifying the types of educational tasks that may benefit most from curiosity-promoting instruction and for developing curiosity-promoting interventions that are maximally effective in supporting the underlying processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many natural mathematical questions are independent of the usual mathematical axioms. The most famous example is the continuum hypothesis (CH), which is the statement that any infinite set of real numbers is either countable or has the same size as all the reals. This became Hilbert's First Problem. The first breakthrough was in 1940 by Kurt Godel, who showed that CH cannot be refuted by the standard mathematical axioms, known as ZFC (Zermelo-Fraenkel set theory with the axiom of choice). Then in 1964 Paul Cohen invented the method of forcing and used it to show that the continuum hypothesis is actually independent of ZFC. In other words, neither CH, not its negation is a logical consequence of the ZFC axioms. Since Cohen's work, modern set theory investigates ZFC constraints (i.e. ""what is necessary"") versus relative consistency results obtained by forcing (i.e. ""what is possible""). Both questions are addressed by infinitary combinatorics, the study of infinite objects in mathematics. This study generates many projects and research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>The PI will focus on using forcing and large cardinals to investigate properties of infinite objects. The main motivation is analyzing ZFC-constraints against consistency results. The project will center on analyzing combinatorial principles, such as the tree property, stationary reflection and square principles, and their relation to cardinal arithmetic, especially singular cardinal arithmetic. The tree property and stationary reflection are compactness type properties that follow from large cardinals. Compactness is the phenomenon where if a certain property holds for every smaller substructure of a given object, then it holds for the object itself. On the other hand, square properties are canonical instances of incompacntess that hold in Godel's constructible universe L and are at odds with large cardinals. This project will analyze their interplay and interaction with cardinal arithmetic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As thaw progresses, a well-drained landscape with a maze of tiny surface drainages may form. This dense network of small channels represents the capillaries of the Arctic hydrologic system and serves as the originators of the water that feeds large rivers. An expanding capillary hydrologic system may change habitat for wildlife due to an overall drying of the tundra landscape, increased river runoff, and through more nutrients exported from terrestrial to aquatic environments. Further, an expanding capillary hydrological network that is identifiable from sub-meter resolution satellite imagery can serve as an indicator of ice-rich permafrost thaw and, therefore, warn of hazard to infrastructure. The development and expansion of a surface drainage system may also decrease the likelihood of moss to thrive, which results in loss of a vegetation cover that effectively cools the ground and preserves the upper permafrost from thawing. The project will produce a pan-Arctic map of the capillary hydrological system and in selected areas, advance understanding of how the capillary system has changed over time. The geospatial products will be made publicly accessible on the Permafrost Discovery Gateway to enable discovery and knowledge-generation by scientists, stakeholders, and the public.<br/><br/>Field observations have shown that runoff from many Arctic rivers has increased in recent decades. Simultaneously, several studies have documented ice wedge degradation across the Arctic, and a handful of local field and remote sensing studies in Northern Alaska have shown that the capillary hydrologic system is expanding due to partial melting of ice wedges. This project aims to map the extent of the capillary hydrologic system across the pan-Arctic tundra and assess the role of the capillary system in generating water flow and lateral carbon flux to large rivers. Graph analysis techniques applied to the pan-Arctic ice-wedge polygon map, as well as deep learning/AI algorithms trained to detect a capillary system from very high spatial resolution satellite imagery, will allow the network of ice wedges and the capillary hydrologic system to be mapped across the Arctic tundra. Field measurements in northern and northwestern Alaska will include geochemical water sampling, coring of permafrost to assess ice-wedge status (degradation or stabilization), and ground-truthing for the remote sensing hydrologic network analyses. This new information will inform a numerical hydrology model to quantify how important the capillaries are in contributing freshwater and carbon flows to the Arctic Ocean. Earlier hydrological model experiments have shown that the formation of connected troughs-networks can double the runoff from the landscape even if the rain and snowfall amounts remain unchanged. The pan-Arctic map of hydrological capillaries will support a first study on how important sub-meter wide channels are to large Arctic river runoff.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such compounds are useful materials with a range of societally relevant applications, for example, as pharmaceutical agents or as modulators for chemical manufacturing processes, but traditional methods for their preparation are limited in scope and/or dependent on the use of precious metal-based catalysts. By contrast, the process of interest is quite versatile and its dependence on nickel, an earth abundant metal, means that the chemistry is more environmentally sustainable. A prominent feature of the process is that it enables the generation of biarenes in which one twisted form of the molecule (analogous to the concept of handedness) predominates over the other. The broader impacts of the award will extend to the benefits accrued to society as Professor Watson and his coworkers engage in a variety of education and outreach activities. Most notably, the Research Experiences for Academic Chemists in Training (REACT) program which is designed to maintain engagement in the physical sciences from students who are initially disadvantaged upon entering college due to poor academic preparation and consequently, of high risk of dropping out. The REACT program is anticipated to be particularly beneficial to students belonging to groups underrepresented in the STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce.<br/><br/>The funded project involves further study of the enantioselective Ni-catalyzed reductive aryl halide coupling recently reported by the Watson laboratory and which offers potential gains in efficacy and scope over established procedures for the synthesis of non-racemic axially chiral biarenes. The investigation is divided across three objectives designed to allow for development of the method while more fully realizing its synthetic potential. The first objective is focused on extending the homocoupling process to substrates not previously explored to target binaphthyl and biphenyl systems from a range of ortho-halo- (typically bromo-) substituted arenes including aryl phosphines/phosphine oxides, esters, amines, and thioethers. The second objective involves pursuit of an intramolecular variant of the method to achieve enantioselective reductive cyclizations of suitably tethered bis(haloarenes) and leading to both C2-symmetric and non-symmetric polycyclic biaryls. The latter include examples of MOP and PHOX type systems which may be useful in their own right as tunable chiral ligand frameworks. The final and most ambitious objective is directed at the realization of a highly enantioselective cross-coupling between two distinct aryl halide substrates. Here, the necessary conditions to avoid competing homocoupling events will be identified to allow for the potential emergence of a general platform for the preparation of biaryls with broad applicability. The High Throughput Experimentation (HTE) laboratory at the University of Delaware will be used extensively during the course of the outlined studies to facilitate the rational screening campaigns needed to evaluate and optimize factors such as ligand structure, additive and solvent effects, temperature, and other reaction variables. The findings of this work are anticipated to lead to fundamental advances impactful to the practice of biaryl synthesis and to the wider field of enantioselective catalysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Deterministic systems with unstable behavior appear in a wide range of applications, ranging from atomic to planetary scales. In many cases the instability is caused by exponential divergence of nearby trajectories. Long time behavior of such systems cannot be predicted exactly unless the initial conditions are known precisely, and consequently it is necessary to use statistical descriptions of the orbits. The project also addresses simple models of mixed dynamical behavior where systems exhibit features associated with both regular and stochastic behaviors. Such models occur as paradigmatic examples explaining more complicated phenomena. In addition, the project provides opportunities for research training and mentoring of graduate students. The principal investigator will also disseminate results through lectures and expository writing.<br/><br/>The project focuses on the statistical properties of dynamical systems. It consists of four parts. First, precise asymptotics in limit theorems for dynamical systems will be considered. Sharp limit theorem estimates have recently been shown by the principal investigator and others to have applications in dynamics. A local limit theorem for non-autonomous systems will be studied. The principal investigator plans to classify obstructions to classical asymptotic expansions, and to develop new tools applicable in cases where the classical expansions fail. A second topic to be considered is exponential mixing. Sharp limit theorems for exponentially mixing systems will be studied through an exploration of geometric structures in the associated phase space. Next, the principal investigator will study flexibility of statistical properties through the construction of dynamical systems with exotic properties.

In these models, the objects aiming to describe reality are functions defined in regions of space-time and satisfying certain partial differential equations. The research carried out by the PI focuses on the equations arising in the context of fluid mechanics. The solutions of partial differential equations are usually described by an infinite number of parameters. This is a complication, but the reward is that the resulting models are in some sense canonical. For example, once we make a small number of very reasonable assumptions about fluid motion, we necessarily end up with the incompressible Navier-Stokes equation. There is essentially no ambiguity about what the model should be, and the Navier-Stokes equation is widely used in science and engineering, from airplane design, weather prediction, and climate modeling to computations of various water flows. To be able to perform computer simulations of the equations, it is necessary to reduce the continuum models to models described by finitely many parameters. However, this step is not canonical, there are many reasonable ways of doing it. When the continuum model is well-understood mathematically, its reductions to finite-dimensional models and their relations are relatively well understood. Of course, one should not overstate this - even in that case there are still many interesting open problems. However, our mathematical understanding of the Navier-Stokes equation is quite incomplete, and that makes the interpretations of the results from its finite-dimensional reductions harder. One way to think about the research in this project is that it aims to contribute to filling this gap in our knowledge and ultimately make our modeling more efficient. The project provides research training opportunities for graduate students.<br/><br/>At a more technical level, this project focuses on the following topics: (i) Well-posedness, (non)-uniqueness, backward uniqueness, and critical situations for basic equations. In recent years, important advances have been made concerning well-posedness and non-uniqueness for the Navier-Stokes and related equations, but important basic questions still remain open. For example, can the solution operator be continuously extended from smooth solutions to spaces with topologies generated by natural physical quantities such as energy? Are regularity estimates in two-dimensional domains with boundary saturated by some solutions? (ii) Steady-state solutions of the three-dimensional Navier-Stokes equation and deformations of Serrin?s swirling vortex. The study of steady-state solutions, in addition to being of independent practical interest, provides insights for improving our understanding of time-dependent solutions. In this project, the focus is on deformations of certain known classes of solutions (due to Serrin) with symmetries to solutions with fewer symmetries. It is worth pointing out that both Serrin's solutions and the deformations envisaged here have connections to tornadoes; (iii) Liouville Theorems and related linear problems. Liouville theorems aim to describe global bounded solutions in all space-time and are closely related to open regularity questions about the equation. In this project, they are studied mostly in the steady-state setting. Their study also leads to interesting linear problems that will be addressed; (iv) One-dimensional models, including the study of possible avoidance of singularities by generic forcing for the quaternionic Burgers model and the global well-posedness and more detailed solution behavior for the De Gregorio model. There are many open problems even at the level of the one-dimensional models. These problems should provide good steppingstones towards improving our understanding and eventually applying the lessons learned from studying these models to higher dimensions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is considerable societal concern about the effects of media use on young children. However, we know very little about how media affects children?s language development over time. Media use could negatively impact language development by displacing other important activities like shared book reading and interactions with parents and peers. This is a crucial area to study because early language skills are critical contributors to later academic achievement. <br/><br/>This study follows children from age 3 to 5 and examine their media use and language skills. Beyond how much media children use overall, data collection includes information about how much children use media with adults, how much children use interactive (apps/games) vs. noninteractive (TV/video) media, and how much children use educational media. These factors may influence the impact of media use on language development. A wide range of data sources are used to capture a nuanced view of children?s media use. Further, information is collected about a host of covariates that are likely to be linked to both media use and language development. This allows for the identification of the unique relation between media use and children?s language development during this crucial time frame.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will strengthen a partnership with a community college to encourage more students to consider mathematics or science teaching as a profession, including those from ethnically diverse backgrounds. There is increased interest in engineering at middle and high schools around the country. Responding to this interest, the project will provide students with experiences in engineering education through supplemental coursework and the opportunity to earn an engineering education microcredential. Finally, this project provides new graduates support via a summer bridge program designed to encourage first-year teaching readiness and promote continued growth and collaborative networking.<br/><br/>This project at Northern Arizona University (NAU) includes a partnership with Coconino Community College (CCC), Flagstaff Urban School District, and Sinagua Middle School. Several project goals will guide the work of the investigators for the next 5 years. First is to provide 30 undergraduate mathematics/science majors with up to two years of scholarships to pursue teacher certification. Second is to support a partnership with CCC to increase recruitment of potential STEM majors from diverse backgrounds. Third is to support up to 48 students per year (after year 1) in an engineering education microcredential program. The fourth and final goal is to provide new graduates support in preparing for their first year of teaching through a summer bridge program. All of these efforts will contribute to the long-term retention and success of mathematics and science teachers to effectively educate students from diverse backgrounds and provide expanded STEM experiences through incorporation of engineering education in high-need districts. Program efficacy for attracting, developing, and retaining effective science and mathematics teachers will be measured by determining to what extent scholars participate in STEM recruitment and teaching/learning activities, such as the engineering education microcredential and summer bridge programs, and to what extent the university/community college partnership broadens participation in the mathematics/science teaching careers.

These models find wide applications in various disciplines, including condensed matter physics, material science, computer science, and biology, in the study of objects such as quantum particles in disordered media, the growth of bacterial colonies, traffic flow, and the kinetic theory of gases. A focus is to understand universality, the phenomenon where microscopically different probabilistic models produce the same limiting behavior. This project also contains educational components, including curriculum development and supporting K-12 extracurricular math programs.<br/><br/>The specific models to be investigated fall into three categories. The first is the Anderson model described by the lattice Schrdinger equation with i.i.d. random potentials. The main objective is to mathematically establish the localization phenomenon, where wave packets do not spread. The principal investigator (PI) plans to carry out comprehensive studies of this model under reduced regularity assumptions. The second theme of this project is the Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality, which describes the scaling limit of various random growth processes. In the past quarter-century, enormous progress has been made on those with exact-solvable structures. The PI will use geometric and probabilistic methods to study the asymptotics of several such exactly-solvable models, including local environment limits and scaling limits under large deviation, and a limiting random geometry termed the directed landscape. The ultimate goal is to extend KPZ universality beyond exact-solvability. The third topic concerns Gibbs samplers, which are Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) algorithms used to sample high-dimensional distributions. The focus is on the continuous state space setting, where tools to analyze time evolution are relatively limited. A particular instance is Kac's walk from kinetic theory, whose order of mixing time was only determined in recent years. The PI plans to develop a general framework to understand the mechanism behind the evolution of these Gibbs samplers, and prove predicted cutoffs for them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over the past three years, western Kentucky manufacturers have rapidly accelerated the adoption of these latest-generation technologies in response to challenges imposed by the COVID-19 pandemic. This has resulted in the need for industrial technicians with significantly higher skill levels in the installation, maintenance, and repair of interconnected manufacturing systems and equipment. This is an important issue in rural western Kentucky where manufacturing jobs can provide a higher income than many other occupations. Rural areas compete with urban areas for industrial employers and cannot afford to risk a manufacturer leaving due to the lack of a skilled technical workforce. This three-year project at West Kentucky Community and Technical College (WKCTC) seeks to update its Advanced Manufacturing curriculum to meet the needs of area manufacturers. The project will utilize an advisory team which includes industry partners to align curriculum with industry need. Students will benefit from revised training relevant to the Advanced Manufacturing environment and earn nationally-recognized, stackable industry certifications in 24 months or less. Faculty associated with the project will benefit from professional development with updated equipment and teaching methods. Because WKCTC has a high population of rural students who are underrepresented in their pursuit of STEM pathways, this project has the potential to broaden participation in the STEM workforce and generate new knowledge on the degree to which revised teaching methods and stronger industry and K-12 partnerships prepare students for industry employment. <br/><br/>The overall goal of the project is to better prepare students to enter the STEM workforce with industry-aligned classwork, while meeting area industry need for digitally-skilled Advanced Manufacturing technicians. The project will update and enhance technician training courses specific to advanced sensors, robotics, and artificial intelligence systems. Six principle activities provide a framework for the project's execution. First is the provision to WKCTC faculty of training so they are qualified to teach latest-generation Industry 4.0 technology curriculum. Second is updating existing Electrical, Industrial Maintenance, and Air Conditioning Technology courses to meet industry standards. Third is to add and embed relevant, nationally recognized industry certifications into coursework. Fourth is updating student lab equipment to align with what is being used by regional employers, and fifth is to engage industry partners in curriculum design and student learning. Sixth, and finally, is offering annual workshops for high school partners to increase awareness of programs, training, and career options in Industry 4.0 available to their students. This project is funded by the Advanced Technological Education program which focuses on the education of technicians for the advanced technology fields that drive the Nation's economy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This proposal focuses on a key citizenship skill: how children learn to be proficient and critical contributors to public discourse. Research on how children acquire these essential skills is lacking. Rational discourse consists of two main skills: Reason-Responsiveness, the ability to form, maintain, or revise one?s beliefs appropriately in response to reasons provided by others; and Reason-Giving, the ability to provide adequate reasons supporting one?s own claims. The proposed project advances basic knowledge of the development of these two social critical thinking skills and reveals similarities and differences between children in these developmental processes.<br/><br/>This project addresses the development of communicative rationality: how children between the ages of 4 and 9 develop fundamental skills to become proficient and critical contributors to public discourse. Using a mix of experimental and observational methods, the proposed research objectives focus on two key sets of psychological capacities: the development of reason-responsiveness and reason-giving. Additionally, the hypothesis that the development of communicative rationality can be fostered through a specific form of socio-linguistic interaction ? parent-child metatalk ? is tested. This research advances knowledge by i) developing a new perspective on rationality as a social phenomenon (communicative rationality) and further understanding of its development; ii) providing the first systematic test of how communicative rationality can be fostered in children; iii) revealing the influence of cultural factors on children?s developing communicative rationality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project seeks to extend this program from polynomials to differential forms, objects which play a key role in multivariable calculus but whose combinatorial significance is only now becoming appreciated. The combinatorial aspects of this project can be understood and worked on by students with relatively little mathematical background, which opens research possibilities for undergraduates and incoming graduate students. <br/><br/>A central problem in this proposal is a remarkable conjecture of the Fields Institute Combinatorics Group on the structure of the superspace co-invariant ring of the symmetric group. The PI will use graded symmetric group modules (developed in collaboration with Haglund, Shimozono, and Wilson) and a generalization of the flag variety (defined in collaboration with Pawlowski) to study the superspace co-invariant ring. In joint work with Wilson, the PI is developing a version of orbit harmonics which is adapted to the study of superspace quotients. The PI is also (in joint work with Reineke and Tewari) developing a combinatorial understanding of the Donaldson-Thomas invariants of quiver representation theory via orbit harmonics. An ultimate guiding light of this project is a beautiful conjecture of D'Adderio, Iraci, and Vanden Wyngaerd on a quadruply-graded symmetric group module coming from differential forms on two copies of n-space.

The new materials will be of broad importance as they are intended to teach the process of scientific reasoning and data visualization across a range of science, technology, engineering, and math courses. Curriculum materials will feature the early 20th century work of the foundational Black social scientist, W.E.B. Du Bois who pioneered data visualization techniques that are still considered state of the art across science disciplines. Additionally, centering the scholarly work of Du Bois is of importance as he investigated the social causes of racial inequality and promoted empowerment of Black scholars in ways that were accessible for broad audiences. The project team plans to include faculty and students from multiple institutions and science disciplines to contribute to curriculum development and participate in testing its impact. The project intends to measure how the curriculum influences undergraduate student learning, sense of belonging in science, and persistence in science. Curricular materials and study results will be widely shared in an open, online repository, which could benefit large numbers of students and faculty in undergraduate science courses across the country. <br/><br/>The project aims to develop, implement, and assess the Du Bois curriculum module that could be implemented in a variety of science courses during three, 50-minute class or laboratory sessions, along with three homework assignments. Undergraduate students will be engaged in exploring the scholarly work of Du Bois in data science, using data analysis and visualization techniques employed by Du Bois with domain-appropriate data for their particular disciplinary course, and completing metacognitive written reflections on their learning. The curriculum will be developed in collaboration with science faculty and students at each of the three partner institutions ? a Hispanic Serving Institution, a Historically Black College and University where Du Bois earned a degree, and a top-ranked, Ivy League and Primarily White Institution ? each of which has unique student populations. Developed curriculum will be piloted in 40 courses reaching over 1,600 students across the three collaborating institutions. The project will test the hypothesis that implementation of this inclusive curriculum can promote science learning and sense of belonging among undergraduate students, in particular fostering positive science associations and reducing stigma associated with scientists from marginalized backgrounds. Investigation of curriculum impact will use a pre/post-assessment design and published assessment tools that have evidence of validity for measuring constructs such as: 1) belonging, 2) positive (stereotype boost) vs stigmatized (stereotype threat) associations with racial and ethnic identity and scientist identity, stereotypes, and relatability, and 3) self-efficacy. Further, the project will collect assessment evidence in course offerings that use the module intervention as well as in course offerings that do not, enabling direct analyses to test for shifts in student assessments over time that are associated with the intervention. The project has strong potential to advance understanding of how development and implementation of curriculum highlighting the accomplishments of scientists from marginalized groups might promote student success and retention, while also integrating the teaching of science concepts and social justice.

Though ubiquitous, wave-type equations are far from well-understood. The goal of this project is to understand how waves are affected by interference with themselves or with their environment. The research seeks to learn when and why some waves disperse, other waves persist, and still others collapse. Knowing how waves behave drives technological progress - smaller microchips, faster data transmission, and deeper insights into the fundamental physics of the universe. The project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate students, graduate students, and postdoctoral researchers.<br/><br/>The investigator studies the long-time dynamics of solutions to nonlinear wave and dispersive equations, focusing on equations that admit topological solitons, which are used to model the physical phenomena described above. Solitons are localized solitary waves with a nontrivial topological invariant. They were introduced by Skyrme in the 1960s as candidates for particles in classical field theories. They have properties required from a particle in classical mechanics - one can define their position, momentum, and energy - and viewed from a distance, configurations of multiple solitons resemble systems of interacting particles. The investigator's work on multi-soliton dynamics makes this connection with classical mechanics explicit, reducing the dynamics of strongly interacting solitons to underlying n-body problems for their positions, momenta, scales, etc. A guiding principle in the analysis of soliton dynamics is the Soliton Resolution Conjecture, which predicts that generic solutions decompose near the final time of existence into a superposition of finitely many solitons and a term capturing the radiation, often a solution to the underlying linear equation. The investigator will work towards proving the conjecture in certain settings and going beyond it in others by considering three categories of problems: (1) the soliton resolution conjecture for evolution equations without symmetry assumptions, starting with the harmonic map heat flow in two dimensions, which is a long-standing open problem; (2) the unique continuation problem for singular nonlinear waves past the blow-up time;  and (3) the question of giving asymptotic descriptions of multi-soliton solutions and their collisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A fundamental problem in geometry is the classification of algebraic varieties, as it helps us gain a better understanding of the structures and relations between them. The first step in classification is called birational classification, i.e. two algebraic varieties are called birational if they are equal outside some lower-dimensional loci. In this proposal, the PIs will investigate new birational invariants. These invariants will shed new light on the birational classification problem. The Principal Investigators will bring new ideas from differential equations, category theory, mirror symmetry and conformal field theory for achieving this goal. This project will provide research training opportunities for graduate students and early-career researchers.<br/><br/>More concretely, the Principal Investigators will develop an extended theory of variations of non-commutative Hodge structures. It will be based on a new singularity theory of Landau-Ginzburg models and a non-commutative refinement of the notion of spectrum of quantum multiplication operators.

Despite progress in various fields, large disparities in cognitive, economic, and health outcomes persist across social groups in the US based on various characteristics such as race/ethnicity. Since it is not possible to modify ascribed characteristics, the interests of disparity researchers and policymakers often center on identifying malleable risk factors that may play a role in reducing such disparities. However, there are limitations with the current methods for identifying risk factors. This project will address those limitations by developing a comprehensive framework that leverages longitudinal observational data and sequential randomized experimental designs to identify risk factors. Methodological guidance on how to use these approaches will be provided to researchers. An R package, sample code, and video tutorials will be developed. Graduate students will be mentored, and an undergraduate course on quantitative causal reasoning for the social sciences will be created at a Minority Serving Institution.<br/><br/>This project will develop model-based and design-based approaches to causal decomposition that allow for time-varying risk factors (referred to as 'mediators') and outcomes. Current causal decomposition models are restricted. They only consider time-fixed mediators and outcomes and do not provide insight into the optimal time for interventions to reduce disparities. There also is the possibility of omitted variable bias, even with thorough sensitivity analysis, since the results are based on the researcher's subjective judgment on what constitutes a reasonable level of confounding. To develop a framework for analyzing longitudinal observational data, the project will use a generalized linear mixed model, incorporating age as a clock. This approach will enable the determination of when the effects of mediators' peak, fade, or remain flat. The results from this analysis could inform the timing of interventions, including whether sequential or simultaneous interventions may be more effective for reducing disparities over time. The project also will develop randomized sequential experimental designs that identify their effects (i.e., disparity reduction and remaining disparity). Experimental designs rely on fewer assumptions and allow researchers to test actual (rather than hypothetical) interventions to reduce disparities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Exclusionary school discipline, such as school expulsion, is an important component of the school-to-prison pipeline and associated with youth drop out, delinquency, and justice system contact.  Mentoring interventions for expelled students may represent a key, untapped potential lever of change for preventing and reducing risk behaviors, while promoting positive youth development, and disrupting the school-to-prison pipeline from a midstream vantage. However, research is needed to determine the most effective structure of mentorship programming for this population of youth.  <br/><br/>The research will be conducted on participants in the University of South Carolina Adolescent Mentoring Program (USC AMP).  Developed in 2017, USC AMP is a university-community partnership program that matches trained university student mentors who are planning to pursue a career in a criminal justice, human services, or law-related field with youth who have been expelled from their traditional high school and currently attend a disciplinary alternative school.  To explore whether alternative school-based mentoring programs promote positive youth outcomes, the researchers will use a mixed methods experimental design and draw upon quantitative survey data and qualitative interview data collected from mentor-mentee pairs.  The researchers will evaluate differences in 9- and 18- month educational, vocational, and delinquency outcomes between expelled students receiving one-on-one mentoring alone and those receiving a supplemental structured curriculum.  The researchers will also examine the impact of the mentorship experience on the university student mentors, particularly their perceptions of cognitive, personal, and interpersonal skill growth.  This project will advance the scientific understanding of the impact of mentoring programs and has the potential to provide a scalable blueprint for reducing the school-to-prison pipeline and illuminate a curricular experience that allows undergraduate students to move beyond skill competency to develop emotional intelligence, personal, and interpersonal professional skills. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Law & Science, and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR) programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Migrations have occurred throughout human history and were as important in the past as they are today, particularly with concerns such as cultural identity, interactions between groups of people, land, and security. Along with the movement of people come not just practices and ideas, but physical bodies and objects that occupy area and space differently. The results of such massive social and cultural changes occur throughout time and space all over the world, with archaeological interest particularly focused on changes in political institutions and subsistence patterns. However, these archaeological studies in the past have often assumed that changes occur ubiquitously and unilaterally. This assumption minimizes the autonomy and agency of the local populations who are acting, interacting, and reacting to these changes and to the immigrant populations. This study examines one such shift that highlights and provides a case-study for these large-scale changes which in this case was characterized by an increase in population, sedentism, agriculture, trade networks, shared iconography and ideologies, intensified political stratification, intensified monumental construction, and the emergence and peak of chiefdoms and chiefly centers. <br/><br/>This case relates to the impact of immigration on these local non-stratified communities and how they adapted with the arrival of the earliest agricultural peoples. The researchers focus on two archaeological sites in the same region .By focusing on evidence for local and regional-scale transformations, this project provides unique insights into the social and political processes and practices that defined the spread of the agricultural lifeway. The researchers evaluate several interrelated domains of archaeological data including subsistence, crafting, site organization, and regional organization from these sites before, during, and after evidence of agriculture appears. One goal is to determine whether local people welcomed this new practice or actively resisted doing so. By integrating data from archaeological excavations, radiocarbon dating, botanical analyses, and museum collections this project permits the researchers to evaluate different possible models. By producing a more complete record of social and cultural practices the project  informs the broader study of processes involved and variation in changes to complex socio-political phenomena such as practices of agricultural intensification and social inequality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The U.S. alone wastes approximately 200 billion pounds, which accounts for $240 billion in revenue loss, equal to 30-40% of the total food supply. This waste ends up in landfills, contributing to 3.3 gigatons of greenhouse gas emissions. To reduce waste and greenhouse gases, this research proposes the conversion of food waste to 2,3-butanediol and other valuable end-products. Food waste will be collected from Elementary and Middle Schools within the Nashville, TN Metro Public Schools District to evaluate its potential in bioproduct production, while also increasing awareness and participation from young, underrepresented future scientists. Food waste samples collected from schools will be analyzed with regards to nutrient composition, sorting methods, and storage conditions. These results will help determine the best methods for collecting food waste in the future. To carry-out conversion of food waste to valuable compounds, heat-stable bacteria will be added to food waste to take advantage of naturally occurring microbial fermentation. Unique heat-tolerant bacteria can outcompete other contaminant microbes found in food waste when incubation temperatures are increased to approximately 50 C. In doing so, food waste will not require sterilization, reducing the cost of conversion and the impact on the environment. Overall, this study will address the existing knowledge gap and help to provide an efficient means of converting food waste to bioproducts. The project will also provide educational and research opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>The major goal of this project is to convert non-sterile food waste into valuable bioproducts through ?open? thermophilic fermentation. One of the major concerns of using food waste for bioproduct production is the unpredictable heterogeneity and inconsistent nature. While food waste does contain high energy macromolecules for microbial fermentation, a consistent feedstock is needed to sustain a potential bioeconomy through food waste remediation. Another issue limiting the usage of food waste is the cost associated with sterilization. To remove native contaminant microorganisms, sterilization methods (e.g., high-pressure steam) must be carried out. However, to skip these processes and suppress native microbes, a novel high-heat fermentation method with Bacillus licheniformis YNP5-TSU is proposed. In addition to this approach, collections of new thermophilic microorganisms and metagenomic sequencing of hot springs, within Yellowstone National Park, will be conducted to yield novel heat stable enzymes and/or microorganisms that can be used to improve current thermophilic food waste conversion. The effectiveness of this study will impact future endeavors to use food waste as a sustainable feedstock.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will show that the degree to which producers can shift cost increases on to consumers depends on the shape of the demand curve.  The research also provides a new and better way of measuring the shape of the demand curve as well as under what conditions producers can shift cost increases to consumers.

Economists have favored the use of mixed logit to accommodate idiosyncratic preferences over product attributes and price because it allows for unrestricted substitution patterns. However, the curvature properties of this model remain unknown. The first project explores how different elements of consumer preferences condition demand curvature and shows that only price random coefficient has any influence, and that the distribution of price random coefficients is key to expanding the range of estimable curvature in discrete choice models. The results show that the key to identifying demand curvature is the pass-through rates of common cost shifts at different price levels for multi-product firms.  These results can be extended to accommodate demographic- and other price interactions in quasi-linear preferences models. The second project applies this methodology to study the impact of updating alcohol taxes on the noncompetitive liquor industry to show how the methodology leads to more accurate predictions of the effects of supply chain disruptions.  The third project applies the flexible modelling in the first project to evaluate whether changing preferences affect demand curvature, hence secular markups.

The PI will also be involved in organizing conferences and seminars.<br/><br/>This project will develop and expand general techniques to determine when certain classifying invariants are possible for a given classification problem.

Specifically, the PI will further develop the relationship between symmetric models of set theory, in which the axiom of choice fails, and Borel equivalence relations which are ""classifiable by countable structures"". This relationship will be applied to settle several problems about such equivalence relations and to further analyze their structure up to Borel reductions and Borel homomorphisms. Furthermore, generalized frameworks of classifying invariants, beyond ""classification by countable structures"", will be studied.

The proposed activity will result in deeper insights into the small scale structure of dynamical systems, in the training of highly qualified postdoctoral fellows and graduate students, in broader interactions between senior and junior experts in various branches of real and complex dynamics, and in the preparation of a book to assist the research community in acquiring background in the area. In addition, the Principal Investigator will facilitate communication within the field through the organization of international conferences and scientific programs and by maintaining a dynamics-related web site.<br/><br/>The project addresses several geometric themes within complex low-dimensional dynamics, making a gradual transition from the one-dimensional to the two-dimensional world. In connection with dynamics in one dimension, renormalization will be investigated as a unifying and powerful tool for elucidating the small-scale structure of dynamical objects. Specific topics under consideration include a semi-local theory of neutral maps and a priori bounds for infinitely renormalizable quadratic polynomials with applications to the problem of local connectivity of the Mandelbrot set. Other topics of study include the dynamics generated by Schwarz reflections in quadrature domains and the dynamics of dissipative complex Henon maps. In connection with the latter, specific themes include the construction of two-dimensional examples of real and complex wild attractors and the development of a general theory of unimodal Henon maps. The project will also explore applications of higher dimensional holomorphic dynamics to the spectral theory of self-similar groups. Finally, the principal investigator will continue to work on a multi-volume book on the conformal geometry and dynamics of quadratic polynomials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A prominent example of these types of structures is the tunable and reversibly iridescent reflectors. These proteins are found within specialized cells, called iridocytes, present in the skin of certain squid species. Iridescence in these cells is driven by reversible phosphorylation of reflectins. Due to their fascinating properties, reflectins and the light-manipulating assemblies that contain them have served as bioinspiration for a range of work aiming to develop next-generation active biophotonic biomaterials and nanotechnologies. However, the molecular details of reflectin assembly, as well as the mechanisms and evolution of tunability, remains poorly understood. Reflectin proteins have a unique amino acid sequence that is likely critical in enabling them to serve their biophotonic functions. This project seeks to disentangle the effects of multiple features within reflectin's unique amino acid to its assembly properties and biophotonic function. Soka University of America undergraduates will receive scientific training and research experience as they work with the PI and contribute to this project. The PI will also engage a broader group of undergraduates in research by offering a Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience that enables students to participate in an authentic semester-long research project involving reflectins.<br/> <br/>Reflectins proteins are intrinsically disordered block copolymers. Recent work suggests that reflectin proteins undergo liquid-liquid phase separation to form biomolecular condensates. While condensate formation by many proteins has been linked to a range of cellular processes, reflectins are unique in their biological role as drivers of tunable biophotonics and in their observed ability to assemble into dynamically arrested spherical assemblies of predictable size. The PI and undergraduate coworkers will characterize reflectin proteins using a range of techniques including microscopy, light scattering, and more, to elucidate the hidden design principles that link reflectin's sequence to its assembly properties. These discovered design principles will then be applied to rationally re-engineer reflectin to improve its capability as a tunable biomaterial. The PI will extend the characterization of single- and multi-component reflectin condensates to within eukaryotic cells, elucidating how these proteins behave within more complex cellular environments. This project will offer insight into possible mechanisms for the evolution of tunable iridescence in loliginid squids and will also produce a deeper understanding of the molecular mechanisms that drive reflectin tunable assembly and dynamic arrest, providing knowledge that may be potentially applied towards the development of future biophotonic technologies and biomaterials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Model theorists aim to isolate certain combinatorial features enjoyed by definable sets in tame structures and to develop a general theory of structures satisfying these properties. This unifies and explains the tameness of a structure or family of structures, but also provides an engine for proving deep structure theorems by exploiting the combinatorial similarity of a structure under analysis to well-understood mathematical objects.  The model-theoretic notion of simplicity was a distillation of the tameness of sets definable in random graphs, pseudo-finite fields, and algebraically closed difference fields and has served as a key ingredient in applications of model theory to combinatorics and algebraic dynamics.  Simplicity was the first of the model-theoretic tree properties to be isolated and studied, but since then there have been a number of model-theoretic properties that have received intensive study, generalizing and deepening the achievements of simplicity theory.  The PI will continue to develop the theory of model-theoretic tree properties and pursue applications in algebra and combinatorics. The project also provides research training opportunities for graduate students. <br/><br/>The simple theories were defined by Shelah as the class of theories without the tree property, a combinatorial property of a formula that he isolated in the study of independence in stable theories.  The first applications were set-theoretic, but the core tools of simplicity theory also led to a consolidation of the techniques at play in the analysis of concrete structures coming from algebra and combinatorics, most notably in the case of pseudo-finite fields and smoothly approximable structures built out of classical geometries over finite fields.  The development of the theory, then, sparked a two-way exchange between the theory and the examples, leading to refined understanding of core notions in model theory. The template established by simple theories, of a theory for class of theories defined by a combinatorial condition on trees of definable sets built on a theory of independence, was successfully replicated for a variety of dividing lines.  Moreover, this extension has revealed striking connections and applications to combinatorics, allowed for the analysis of core new algebraic examples, and led to the resolution of difficult open problems in model theory.  This project takes a systematic approach to model-theoretic tree properties, consolidating the core techniques to address both internal questions within model theory and applications to a diverse array of structures coming from algebra, geometry, and combinatorics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For systems that evolve with time, one aims to determine which perturbations will preserve the system?s long-term behavior and which perturbations will lead to radically different outcomes. This project concerns stability and bifurcations in the setting of complex algebraic dynamical systems. Such systems are defined by polynomial formulas in one or several variables. The algebraic nature of the defining equations connect the dynamical study with the rich theory of algebraic geometry. Moreover, in the case of examples where all of the defining polynomials have, for example, integer coefficients, the relevant dynamical stability questions have surprising connections to number theory and to the Diophantine geometry of the underlying equations. The project will extend the theory of dynamical stability for complex analytic examples to new settings that arise naturally in arithmetic geometry and complex dynamics. The project also provides research and training opportunities for graduate students and postdocs.<br/><br/>This project develops the theory of stability for analytic families of maps on projective spaces, in both a complex analytic setting and in the setting of non-archimedean-valued fields and p-adic analysis. It was recently discovered, in earlier work of the PI and of other researchers, that certain questions about height functions and arithmetic intersection theory can be analyzed using complex dynamics. In a series of recent breakthroughs in arithmetic geometry, especially concerning uniform bounds for numbers of rational points on families of algebraic varieties, stability theory played a crucial--if somewhat hidden--role. This project aims to shed new light on the role of stability theory and to push the theory further. Many of the proposed problems and applications of the theory are related to the occurrence of `unlikely intersections? in families of abelian varieties or in more general families of polarized dynamical systems. Specific goals of this project include (1) to characterize positivity properties of certain bifurcation currents and measures; (2) to provide bounds on the geometry of invariant subvarieties for algebraic dynamical systems; and (3) to formulate a theory of bifurcations in the setting of p-adic analytic families of maps. The research activity conducted under this award is expected to impact multiple areas of mathematics, including number theory, geometry, and dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conjugated polymers carry significant potential for applications as organic electronic materials owing to their lightweight, flexible nature and diverse optoelectronic properties. However, realization of advanced technologies necessitates a degree of structural control beyond current synthetic capabilities.  This work addresses this limitation and will seek to achieve length- and sequence-controlled polymerization of conjugated polymers using a combination of electrochemical and photochemical tools to polymerize a broad range of simple arene substrates. The developed methodology will be applied to the synthesis of novel polymers for organic electronics and new methods for additive manufacturing. The synthetic innovations associated with this research have the potential to create advanced organic electronic devices with applications in sustainable energy, healthcare, and communications. Furthermore, the designed photochemical reactivity of monomers may be applicable to the upcycling of conjugated polymers once used rather than discard these as waste. The interdisciplinary nature of this research will provide educational and professional development opportunities for student researchers. The research team will work to increase representation of non-majority scholars through inclusive mentoring, teaching and service.  Outreach activities to local communities will focus on educational resources related to electronic waste handling and disposal, sustainable polymer feedstocks and biodegradable plastics.<br/><br/>This research will focus on developing the length- and sequence-controlled polymerization of thiophene based monomers using a combination of electrochemical and photochemical tools.  The modular platform for precision synthesis of conjugated polymers will utilize electrochemical C-H functionalization to selectively couple an arene and a sulfide to form an arylsulfonium salt, which will also serve as monomer in a novel photo-mediated chain growth polymerization. By performing electrolysis and photolysis simultaneously, the sulfide will essentially act as a catalyst to achieve controlled oxidative polymerization.  The developed direct method for the preparation of arylsulfonium salts through C-H functionalization aims to improve upon the atom economy of existing multi-step chemical methods. The photopolymerization studies have the potential to provide fundamental knowledge on the photochemical reactivity of conjugated polymers and introduce conceptually novel mechanisms for controlling molecular weight through wavelength modulation. Strategies that reduce the reliance on transition metals for polymerizing aromatic units are important for improving the sustainability of polymer science and technology. In general terms, this research has the potential to provide a more universal approach to sequence-defined and controlled polymerizations of conjugated polymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Shaw of the University of California, Davis is studying the development of new methods for the synthesis of sulfonimidamides (SIAs). SIAs are organic molecules that do not occur in nature and, as such, are relatively unexplored. They exhibit chirality, i.e. the ability to exist in a ?right-? or ?left?-handed configuration. This property makes them interesting molecules to study both for their reactivity and for the unique properties that they are expected to impart to new drugs, materials, and other useful applications. The funded research includes investigations into how to make these molecules selectively of one  handedness or of largely one enantiomeric configuration using new catalytic methods that will be optimized for efficiency and examined for breadth of application. In addition, this project will examines how this chirality or ?handedness?at a sulfur center can influence the formation of new bonds adjacent to the SIA, which will enable the synthesis of new, complex SIAs that have been not been accessed or explored heretofore. These related studies will lay the groundwork for future applications in  engineering and medicine that have the potential to open up new vistas for discovery and application. In parallel to the scientific experiments, this project will involve a monthly science caf that provides an accessible (and fun!) event where scientists communicate their work to the general public at an off-campus venue. The broader impacts of this work center on enabling the discovery of new molecules to benefit society as well as the public discussion of science from across UC Davis and how it benefits the state, community, and society.<br/><br/>The funded research centers on the development of new synthetic methods related to sulfonimidamides (SIAs). This underexplored functional group in organic chemistry provides fertile ground for the discovery from potentially new pharmaceutical lead compounds to new materials and catalysts. This research examines several new catalytic, enantioselective methods for the synthesis of SIAs, including cyclic versions of these molecules that are currently unknown outside of patent literature. These catalytic methods include dynamic kinetic resolution (DKR) using transition metal complexes as well as new phosphorous-based conversion of S=O bonds to S=N bonds. In addition, the impact of sulfur-based chirality on nucleophilic addition reactions that generate new stereogenic centers will be examined. Although previous methods used S-chiral compounds, e.g. sulfinimides, as chiral auxiliaries, this work seeks to make structurally novel SIAs with multiple adjacent carbon stereogenic centers as useful target molecules. Collectively this project aims to take a vertical step in the knowledge of how to make a new functional group in organic chemistry and how that functional group influences the reactivity of adjacent carbon atoms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The kinds of heterocycles being targeted have potential applications as therapeutic agents, agrochemicals, and advanced materials, and as such the outcome of the research could have a variety of societal benefits. The potential advances being offered are made possible with the design of new ligands for palladium that possess unconventional properties. Through both hypothesis-driven and data-driven ligand design strategies, the Paradine laboratory expects to discover selective and broadly useful reactions that will allow for refined tuning of the properties of the molecules of interest. In parallel with research activities, Dr. Paradine will expand mentoring experiences for chemistry graduate students at the University of Rochester and develop a formal course in scientific communication for undergraduate and graduate students. These activities are designed to support the personal and professional development of chemistry students, with a special focus on addressing the needs of students from marginalized groups, and to equip students of all backgrounds with the capacity to be effective scientific communicators in a broad range of contexts and media.<br/><br/>The ability of palladium to form broadly reactive organometallic species has led to the introduction of a diverse array of practical methodologies for synthetic organic chemistry. Indeed, Pd-catalyzed methods have become ubiquitous for the construction of molecular scaffolds rich in sp2-hybridized carbon atoms. Ligand development has been a key driver of this innovation, with electron-rich and bulky ligands such as phosphines and N-heterocyclic carbenes being predominantly used in efforts to uncover new Pd-catalyzed reactivity. However, the success of these ligand families has led to other areas of ligand space for palladium being left largely unexplored, leaving considerable opportunities for reaction discovery, particularly in regard to methods for the construction of sp3-hybridized carbon-rich domains. To address this imbalance, the funded project involves study of unconventional ligand platforms derived from ureas and phosphines to facilitate Pd-catalyzed selective olefin difunctionalization reactions, with an emphasis on heteroannulation processes leading to non-planar heterocyclic scaffolds. The investigation is divided across four aims: (1) development of urea ligand-enabled heteroannulation reactions involving ambiphiles (e.g., 2-bromoanilines) and 1,3-dienes; (2) exploration of the reactivity of new pi-coupling partners with urea-enabled Pd catalysis; (3) elucidation of the fundamental properties of urea ligands and their role in catalysis; and, (4) realization of ligand-controlled site-selectivity in olefin functionalization reactions. Pursuit of these aims will include the foundation of data-driven, predictive models for ligand design that are anticipated to facilitate general strategies for ligand development in the field of transition metal catalysis with associated benefits for future reaction discovery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is designed to support the development of science teacher leaders who will become known as Noyce Master Teaching Fellows (MTFs). These MTFs will learn to provide their students, as well as other science teachers, with success in a STEM learning ecosystem. A STEM learning ecosystem refers to the way a variety of environments, such as schools, community settings, families, businesses, and museums, converge to create an array of learning opportunities for students. When teachers connect school science with diverse ways that science is done across a STEM learning ecosystem, they can likely support a greater diversity of students in gaining interest in science and experiencing increased achievement in science. This project intends to develop, mentor, and retain a cadre of 12 experienced and exemplary science teachers to strengthen a STEM learning ecosystem by pursuing three objectives. First is to build relationships and leadership across the STEM learning ecosystem which includes families, informal and formal STEM organizations, and STEM career and college pathways. Second is to organize diverse learning experiences that leverage connections across the STEM learning ecosystem and that broaden student interest and success in K-12 science. Third, and finally, is to take advantage of mentoring to become leaders in a science teacher professional association. <br/><br/>This project at the University of New Mexico includes partnerships with the Taos, Gallup-McKinley, and Cuba school districts as well as the New Mexico Science Teachers Association, two national laboratories, two businesses, two cultural and community associations, and three museums. Over five years the project intends to provide fellowships to 12 experienced and exemplary practicing teachers from grades K-12. Project goals include building capacity for greater formal and informal networking among K-12 science teachers and other people in the STEM learning ecosystem. The project plans to provide summer institutes, a system of mentoring and networking, and university online micro-courses to support science teacher leaders in advancing their leadership skills, pedagogical skills, and content knowledge. A main goal is for science teacher leaders to use their new knowledge and network connections to create, implement, conduct action research, and disseminate lessons with storylines that connect to family, community, laboratory, and workplace ways of doing science. The project builds on theoretical knowledge about the STEM learning ecosystem and a relational form of leadership called Maize leadership. Similar to an ecosystem perspective, the Maize Model will guide the MTFs to build relationships and respect for diverse people because of a core purpose of holistic interdependent balance and well-being in life. It honors Indigenous values and has demonstrated success in creating pathways to school leadership for diverse cadres of people in New Mexico.

The new materials will be of broad importance as they are intended to teach the process of scientific reasoning and data visualization across a range of science, technology, engineering, and math courses. Curriculum materials will feature the early 20th century work of the foundational Black social scientist, W.E.B. Du Bois who pioneered data visualization techniques that are still considered state of the art across science disciplines. Additionally, centering the scholarly work of Du Bois is of importance as he investigated the social causes of racial inequality and promoted empowerment of Black scholars in ways that were accessible for broad audiences. The project team plans to include faculty and students from multiple institutions and science disciplines to contribute to curriculum development and participate in testing its impact. The project intends to measure how the curriculum influences undergraduate student learning, sense of belonging in science, and persistence in science. Curricular materials and study results will be widely shared in an open, online repository, which could benefit large numbers of students and faculty in undergraduate science courses across the country. <br/><br/>The project aims to develop, implement, and assess the Du Bois curriculum module that could be implemented in a variety of science courses during three, 50-minute class or laboratory sessions, along with three homework assignments. Undergraduate students will be engaged in exploring the scholarly work of Du Bois in data science, using data analysis and visualization techniques employed by Du Bois with domain-appropriate data for their particular disciplinary course, and completing metacognitive written reflections on their learning. The curriculum will be developed in collaboration with science faculty and students at each of the three partner institutions ? a Hispanic Serving Institution, a Historically Black College and University where Du Bois earned a degree, and a top-ranked, Ivy League and Primarily White Institution ? each of which has unique student populations. Developed curriculum will be piloted in 40 courses reaching over 1,600 students across the three collaborating institutions. The project will test the hypothesis that implementation of this inclusive curriculum can promote science learning and sense of belonging among undergraduate students, in particular fostering positive science associations and reducing stigma associated with scientists from marginalized backgrounds. Investigation of curriculum impact will use a pre/post-assessment design and published assessment tools that have evidence of validity for measuring constructs such as: 1) belonging, 2) positive (stereotype boost) vs stigmatized (stereotype threat) associations with racial and ethnic identity and scientist identity, stereotypes, and relatability, and 3) self-efficacy. Further, the project will collect assessment evidence in course offerings that use the module intervention as well as in course offerings that do not, enabling direct analyses to test for shifts in student assessments over time that are associated with the intervention. The project has strong potential to advance understanding of how development and implementation of curriculum highlighting the accomplishments of scientists from marginalized groups might promote student success and retention, while also integrating the teaching of science concepts and social justice. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

Such objects appear in nature as coastlines, mountainous landscapes, river networks, lightning bolts, snowflakes, growth models of plants and crystals, and soap films. The questions the PI plans to study have applications whenever storage of three-dimensional information (landscapes, faces, human brain surface) in a two-dimensional image is desired without loss of information. While in the case of smooth objects (the opposite of fractals) the corresponding mathematical theory is well understood, this is not the case for fractal objects, which require the development of new techniques. Another focus of this project is on rigidity problems, asking whether it is possible to deform a fractal object that is made out of a flexible material into another fractal object, with controlled distortion. Also, fractal sets appear sometimes as boundaries of otherwise smooth objects; another rigidity problem concerns whether these fractals are removable, in the sense that their presence can be ignored for transformation purposes. Rigidity problems on fractal sets have applications in mathematical problems that require ""gluing"" together two functions, or two dynamical systems, or two surfaces, and could result in the better understanding of dynamical systems in physics. This project will also incorporate the training and professional development of graduate students. <br/><br/>The main focus of the project is on two interrelated types of problems on fractals: uniformization and rigidity problems. The uniformization problem asks for geometric conditions on a fractal metric space so that it can be transformed to a smooth space with a well-behaved transformation that preserves the geometry, such as quasiconformal or quasisymmetric maps. Major progress has been made recently towards the quasiconformal uniformization problem with the involvement of the PI. The current project expects to develop an analytic theory for two-dimensional surfaces of locally finite area under no other assumption; the classical approaches in the field of analysis on metric spaces require instead several additional and restrictive geometric assumptions. Specifically, the PI will study the quasiconformal classification of non-smooth surfaces, the embedding of fractal surfaces in Euclidean space, the uniformization of 2-dimensional spheres of infinite area, and potential theory on fractal surfaces. Regarding rigidity problems, the PI will work on the problem of conformal removability, which asks whether a given compact subset of Euclidean space is negligible from the domain of a conformal map. The PI in recent works has displayed several new examples of removable and non-removable planar sets and has found a striking connection between the problems of uniformization and removability. Moreover, the PI has identified a new general class of sets that he conjectures to provide a characterization of removable sets. The PI will study this conjecture, as well as several related removability and rigidity problems in complex dynamics, geometric group theory, and circle domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As evidenced in recent years, a resilient manufacturing sector is critical for coping with an international supply chain disruption. In addition, a strong manufacturing sector is essential to economic prosperity and national security as it generates employment and wealth while encouraging research and technological innovation. The ASI will help prepare an advanced manufacturing workforce for the United States to succeed in an increasingly competitive global market. The ASI will promote collaborative and global thinking and prepare the participating students to become more comfortable with international collaborations. The ASI will also expose participating students to emerging manufacturing technologies, as well as strong bridges between fundamental research and industrial applications. Novel technologies and manufacturing processes or systems resulting from the workforce development and international collaborative research will lead to long-term economic benefits for both the U.S. and Italy. The ASI will help train the next generation of American manufacturing leaders who can leverage the global resources to contribute to a more resilient U.S. economy. <br/><br/>The Advanced Studies Institute (ASI) leverages the unique facilities in Italy to train U.S. manufacturing engineering students and foster innovative research ideas. Italy?s strong manufacturing sector embraces emerging technologies that are the building blocks of Industry 4.0, or the Fourth Industrial revolution. Industry 4.0 transforms a physical model of manufacturing to a digital one, creating ?smart factories? and introducing digital business models.

As thaw progresses, a well-drained landscape with a maze of tiny surface drainages may form. This dense network of small channels represents the capillaries of the Arctic hydrologic system and serves as the originators of the water that feeds large rivers. An expanding capillary hydrologic system may change habitat for wildlife due to an overall drying of the tundra landscape, increased river runoff, and through more nutrients exported from terrestrial to aquatic environments. Further, an expanding capillary hydrological network that is identifiable from sub-meter resolution satellite imagery can serve as an indicator of ice-rich permafrost thaw and, therefore, warn of hazard to infrastructure. The development and expansion of a surface drainage system may also decrease the likelihood of moss to thrive, which results in loss of a vegetation cover that effectively cools the ground and preserves the upper permafrost from thawing. The project will produce a pan-Arctic map of the capillary hydrological system and in selected areas, advance understanding of how the capillary system has changed over time. The geospatial products will be made publicly accessible on the Permafrost Discovery Gateway to enable discovery and knowledge-generation by scientists, stakeholders, and the public.<br/><br/>Field observations have shown that runoff from many Arctic rivers has increased in recent decades. Simultaneously, several studies have documented ice wedge degradation across the Arctic, and a handful of local field and remote sensing studies in Northern Alaska have shown that the capillary hydrologic system is expanding due to partial melting of ice wedges. This project aims to map the extent of the capillary hydrologic system across the pan-Arctic tundra and assess the role of the capillary system in generating water flow and lateral carbon flux to large rivers. Graph analysis techniques applied to the pan-Arctic ice-wedge polygon map, as well as deep learning/AI algorithms trained to detect a capillary system from very high spatial resolution satellite imagery, will allow the network of ice wedges and the capillary hydrologic system to be mapped across the Arctic tundra. Field measurements in northern and northwestern Alaska will include geochemical water sampling, coring of permafrost to assess ice-wedge status (degradation or stabilization), and ground-truthing for the remote sensing hydrologic network analyses. This new information will inform a numerical hydrology model to quantify how important the capillaries are in contributing freshwater and carbon flows to the Arctic Ocean. Earlier hydrological model experiments have shown that the formation of connected troughs-networks can double the runoff from the landscape even if the rain and snowfall amounts remain unchanged. The pan-Arctic map of hydrological capillaries will support a first study on how important sub-meter wide channels are to large Arctic river runoff.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polytopes are geometric objects that include polygons, pyramids, cubes, octahedra, and their higher-dimensional analogs. They have been looked at and studied since antiquity; at present, they play a role in such diverse areas of pure and applied mathematics as optimization, statistics, combinatorics, representation theory, symplectic geometry, to name just a few. Using polytopes as building blocks and gluing them along their faces, one creates polytopal complexes. If the polytopes used are line segments, triangles, pyramids, and their higher-dimensional generalizations, one obtains a special class of polytopal complexes known as simplicial complexes. These objects appear naturally in robotics, discrete geometry, and topology, since they provide a simple way to approximate continuous spaces, such as manifolds, by discrete objects. Simplicial complexes are also useful in describing patterns of intersections of sets. Specifically, patterns of intersections of convex sets have applications in such subjects as neuro-biology (e.g., in the study of neurons which are simultaneously active in response to some stimulus).  This research project aims to deepen our understanding of various aspects of polytopes and simplicial complexes. The award will also provide support of research training for graduate students.<br/> <br/>The primary aim of this project is to gain new insights and enhance our understanding of combinatorial, algebraic, geometric, and topological invariants of simplicial complexes and polytopes through the study of their face numbers, face rings, and stress spaces, and, in the process, to develop new tools to achieve this. Specifically, research on this project will attack several fundamental questions related to (1) the upper bound type problems originated in but going far beyond the classical upper bound theorem for spheres, (2) the lower bound type problems for simplicial complexes, especially simplicial spheres, with an additional structure such as flagness, and (3) finding new construction techniques to produce many simplicial polytopes and spheres with interesting extremal properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Tritium is widely used as a radioactive tracer element in biological and chemical research and molecules labeled with this rare isotope of hydrogen are useful during the development of pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and other kinds of important substances. The findings of the funded research are anticipated to permit the incorporation of tritium (/deuterium) into small molecules with a high level of precision, such that the quantity and location of the hydrogen isotope of choice can be finely controlled. The broader impacts of the funded project extend to the benefits accrued to society as Dr.  Clark and his research team members engage in a variety of educational and outreach activities. Foremost among these efforts is a holistic undergraduate career development and training program that combines undergraduate summer research experiences with a collaborative pharmaceutical industry and academic workshop jointly facilitated by the University of Puerto Rico Cayey and Marquette University. The program is designed to provide students with critical training to prepare them for successful careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and it places an emphasis on attracting participation from individuals belonging to groups traditionally underrepresented in science.<br/><br/>Tritium is an ideal tracer nuclide because of its sufficiently long half-life (12.3 years) and the ability to prepare tritiated compounds with high specific activity for a variety of applications in chemical and biological research. For example, tritium-labeled small molecules are often used in radioligand binding assays and also for absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion (ADME) studies of drug candidates. Despite the many important roles for tritium-containing molecules, there are a limited number of effective synthetic methods for the selective incorporation of precise quantities of tritium into organic compounds. Furthermore, spectroscopic techniques to characterize and quantify tritiated small molecules, especially enantioisotopomers that are chiral by virtue of isotopic substitution, are either underdeveloped or do not currently exist. To address the first challenge, a suite of copper-catalyzed transfer tritiation and hydrotritiation reactions are being investigated that permit the regio- and stereo-controlled incorporation of tritium-atom labels into various types of alkene and alkyne substrates (including: allenes, 1,3-dienes, and enynes). The development of enantioselective variants of these transformations is also being pursued to allow for access to enantioisotopomers that are chiral by virtue of tritium substitution and/or by virtue of deuterium and tritium substitution. To support reaction development, and in regard to the second challenge  identified above, molecular rotational resonance (MRR) spectroscopy is being established as a general analytical technique to quantify enantiomeric excess of enantioisotopomeric materials and to determine their absolute configurations. It is anticipated that the findings from this research will expand access to selectively tritiated small molecules as useful tools for understanding how metabolites and/or pharmaceutical agents are processed in biological systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Biofilms can grow on diverse surfaces, such as medical implants, food containers or boat hulls. Unfortunately, biofilms can cause issues, and their removal can be difficult. For example, in the case of structures or parts of boats that are underwater, divers need to scrub the underwater surfaces. This research proposes using magnetic fields and magnetic nanoparticles to remove biofilms from a distance. Magnetic nanoparticles under the action of magnetic fields that alternate direction will rotate and move to follow the magnetic field, generating mechanical forces and temperature increases. These two effects will be explored by using different magnetic nanoparticles and applied magnetic field combinations to remove biofilms of a model marine biofilm, and the approach will be tested in natural marine biofilms. This project has the potential to yield innovative biofilm-removal technologies for other sectors, including the food industry and healthcare, impacting societal wellbeing and the US economy. Additionally, the research will involve undergraduate minority students, fostering their scientific interests and opening doors for future scientific careers. Researchers will also create easy-to-understand demonstration kits for public distribution  featuring magnetic nanoparticles interacting with magnetic fields.<br/><br/>Bacterial biofilms have a wide range of negative impacts on the economy, society, and human health, such as food spoilage, damage to military vehicles, and infections associated with medical implants. Marine bacterial biofilms grow on various underwater surfaces, like boat hulls and bridge foundations, and can be detrimental for their performance. While physical methods are often needed to remove biofilms, these are not always possible or practical, especially in cases where expensive and risky diving operations are required to access underwater structures. This project will investigate the use of magnetic nanoparticles under alternating magnetic fields to remove marine biofilms. Laboratory grown C. marina biofilms will be used as a model. Different magnetic nanoparticle sizes, shapes and surface coatings will be tested against distinct alternating magnetic field regimes. The biofilm integrity will be evaluated by quantifying the microrheology of the biofilm before and after treatment using dynamic magnetic susceptibility methods, and by analyzing the spatial distribution of bacteria and extracellular polymeric substances using fluorescence imaging. Once an optimal regime for magnetic nanoparticle application and treatment has been established, this approach will be tested with natural marine biofilms. The  project will include undergraduate students underrepresented in STEM fields, increasing their involvement in scientific research. Additionally, a demo kit will be created to showcase the potential applications of magnetic nanoparticles in biomedicine.

This part of the study seeks to understand how contemporary incarceration rates and disparities emerge from both historical residential patterns and recent changes in U.S. communities. The second part of the project examines how multiple, interrelated criminal justice system exposures, from contact to imprisonment, may accumulate to affect community well-being and political participation. An open criminal justice data project establishes a replicable system of data collection, processing, archiving, and analysis that coincides with an interdisciplinary educational program of courses, practicums, and symposia. The integrated research and educational aims of this project expand the participation of underserved students in STEM, share newly collected data on criminal justice exposures with the public, and provide useful insights for interventions addressing inequality and mass incarceration.<br/><br/>To better understand rates of and disparities in criminal justice contact, as well as their influence on community well-being and democratic membership, this project focuses on the measurement and influence of place-based mechanisms?specifically, residential segregation and neighborhood effects.

The first step in classification is called birational classification, i.e. two algebraic varieties are called birational if they are equal outside some lower-dimensional loci. In this proposal, the PIs will investigate new birational invariants. These invariants will shed new light on the birational classification problem.

It will be based on a new singularity theory of Landau-Ginzburg models and a non-commutative refinement of the notion of spectrum of quantum multiplication operators.

Additionally the PIs will investigate the connection between non-commutative spectra and R-charges of conformal field theories. This will lead to even stronger birational invariants, as well as to new unexpected bridges between geometry and other branches of mathematics, including: a new connection between Steenbrink spectra and the spectra of conformal weights in vertex operator algebras; a connection between topological invariants of 3-manifolds and non-commutative spectra of complex surfaces; semicontinuity of non-commutative spectra of algebraic varieties and the RG-flows on sigma-models with targets on such varieties; and a relation between the Kaehler-Ricci flow and the RG-flow.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This metric appears not only in pure mathematics, but frequently in applied mathematics and computer science as well. For example, a digital image may be modeled abstractly as a probability distribution over a 2-dimensional region, and the Wasserstein distance provides a natural measurement of similarity of images under this model. Despite their pervasiveness, these metrics are often difficult to compute, and large aspects of their geometric properties remain poorly understood. This project aims to advance this theory, with a particular emphasis on approximations of Wasserstein metrics through simpler metrics, such as the classical p-metrics on Euclidean spaces. The project also serves to increase the participation of underrepresented groups in mathematics through organization of conferences and seminars with diverse speakers and participants.<br/><br/>In calculating the Wasserstein distance between two distributions, the cost of transporting mass depends on the geometry of the underlying metric space on which the distributions are defined. A main goal of the project is to classify those metric spaces whose Wasserstein-1 metric admits a biLipschitz embedding into the Banach space L1. One side of this question will involve showing the nonexistence of L1-embeddings for certain metric spaces, and on this side the methodology to be used will largely be based on concepts from analysis on fractals. The other side of the challenge will be to show that L1-embeddings do exist for other metric spaces, and towards this end an incorporation of tools from geometric measure theory and metric geometry is planned. Finally, the current methods of proof for existing results rely heavily on the linear theory of Banach spaces. Another main goal of this project is to develop nonlinear methods that yield new insights into existing results as well as provide approaches toward solutions of questions unattainable via linear techniques.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Toscano of the Chemistry Department at Johns Hopkins University. The research will involve the generation and reactivity of biologically relevant reactive sulfur species, including hydropersulfides (RSSH). Hydrogen sulfide (H2S) is an endogenously generated small molecule signaling agent whose diverse physiological effects have been well documented. The chemical mechanisms responsible for these effects, however, remain inadequately defined. Recent reports indicate that much of H2S biological activity may be attributed to RSSH, which have been reported to be involved in the modification of protein cysteine residues (PSH) to generate protein hydropersulfides (PSSH). Recently, there has been intense interest in the physiological functions of these species. For example, protein persulfidation has been shown to be dysregulated and reduced in neurological disorders such as Alzheimer?s, Parkinson?s, and Huntington?s diseases. The research will afford broad, comprehensive training for graduate students and undergraduates, serving them well for future opportunities in both industry and academia. Undergraduate participation in research will continue to be a high priority since previous students have indicated that this experience was the highlight of their college careers and was instrumental in clarifying their interests and preparing them for future studies. An integrated, after school science outreach experience for high school students focusing on the chemistry/biology interface will also be developed.<br/><br/>Despite increasing evidence for the role of RSSH in physiological redox signaling, the biologically relevant chemistry of RSSH is still relatively poorly understood. One way to predict the biological functions of RSSH is to understand their fundamental chemistry. Thus, one focus of the proposed research is further exploration of the fundamental chemical properties of RSSH and related reactive sulfur species. Because RSSH are unstable and decomposes rapidly into a variety of species, they are inherently difficult to study in aqueous solution and are typically generated in situ. Although several strategies for RSSH generation have been reported, there is still an unmet need for the further development of new methods for the efficient and controlled production of RSSH for biological applications. Thus, the development of novel RSSH photoprecursors and protein persulfidating reagents, designed to react cleanly with small molecule thiols to produce RSSH and protein cysteine residues to produce PSSH, will also be evaluated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The goal of this research is to design and synthesize biocompatible organic compounds absorbing in the NIR for photodynamic therapy and other light-induced applications. The project includes elements of organic, physical, computational, and materials chemistry, and is therefore well suited to the education and training of early career scientists. Outreach and research-focused activities involving economically disadvantaged and underrepresented high school students are planned as an integral part of the funded project. Through Professor Carlos E. Crespo-Hernndez's ongoing collaborations, students receive a unique cross-disciplinary and multi-cultural training research experience, with the potential for international exchange and engagement between US chemistry students and those abroad, commensurate with the globalization of science and technology. <br/><br/>Developing new organic compounds and controlling their emissive and intersystem crossing properties represent a major priority for many phenomena of significance to society. This research may hold the key to the development of new photo-drugs for the treatment of cancer, imaging-guided cancer phototherapy, photodynamic inactivation of microorganisms, and the development of fluorescent biomarkers, which will facilitate their use in biotechnical and biomedical applications. For example, photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a clinically approved therapeutic procedure that is rapidly entering the mainstream of cancer treatments. Research in PDT has concentrated primarily on the development of photosensitizers (PSs) that incorporate heavy transition metals to increase their triplet yields. Besides poor selectivity for the target tissue, such metal complexes frequently suffer from high dark cytotoxicity and are often costly and difficult to synthesize. Professor Carlos E. Crespo-Hernndez's group has spearheaded the development of PSs based on the thionation of nucleic acid derivatives. Building on this discovery, this research focuses on the synthesis of carbonyl- and thiocarbonyl-containing chromophores and the study of their one- and two-photon absorption properties upon NIR laser excitation. Their photophysical properties, including singlet-triplet spin-orbit coupling constants, triplet decay lifetimes, and quantum yields of singlet oxygen generation, will be measured. The proposed chemistry is expected to yield new organic PSs capable of absorbing one or two photons in the NIR therapeutic window, a necessary pre-condition for developing an effective PDT agent.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Participants will receive mentoring support by partnering them with previous Noyce scholars. Through this support and training the project aims to increase both the number and quality of secondary mathematics and science teachers available to the rural communities in eastern North Carolina.<br/> <br/>This project at East Carolina University (ECU) includes partnerships with Greene County Schools, Pitt County Schools, Pitt Community College, and the East Carolina University Rural Education Institute. The project will recruit 30 future science and mathematics high school teachers over a four-year period. Students will earn a double major in science/science education or mathematics/mathematics education. They will receive scholarship support during their last two years of a Bachelor of Science (BS) program. The overarching goal is to provide training and support to better prepare secondary mathematics and science teachers to meet the unique needs of rural, high-need school districts. To meet this goal, the project has four objectives. First is to provide specialized education and support for scholars using a microcredential model with virtual reality simulations. Second is to build a Noyce Professional Community by leveraging the expertise of scholars from previous ECU Noyce Grants. Third is to optimize recruitment by building strategic relationships with rural community colleges. The fourth and final objective is to evaluate the teaching of scholars and conduct research that informs the preparation of high school mathematics and science teachers to teach effectively in rural, high-need schools. In addition to preparing 30 new mathematics and science teachers, this project will also provide an opportunity to study how the use of microcredentials and virtual reality simulations impact the knowledge of, competencies for, and self-efficacy of high school mathematics and science teachers to implement culturally responsive teaching practices during their clinical experiences and early years of teacher induction.

However, in-person conferences have significant barriers to access and inclusion, often excluding scientists and institutions with less financial resources and individuals for whom long-distance travel is difficult. The shift to virtual conferences during the COVID-19 pandemic demonstrated these historical barriers, as conferences were attended by more diverse groups of scientists. This research investigates how and whether virtual and hybrid conferences in ecology, environmental science, and allied fields have increased participation by individuals from a diverse set of institutions, including academic organizations like universities and organizations outside of academia like government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and environmental consulting firms. By focusing on increasing institutional diversity, scientific conferences can improve collaboration and knowledge exchange between academic and extra-academic scientists, facilitating evidence-based environmental management. The project will also assess whether virtual and hybrid conferences are more inclusive of a diverse set of backgrounds and career stages and assess barriers, attitudes, and preferences related to conference access, attendance, and participation. Lastly, researchers will identify future and alternative virtual and hybrid formats and features likely to best support members from diverse institutions and backgrounds. Short-term outcomes will include guidance for professional societies to develop equitable and inclusive conferences and overcome barriers to access; long-term outcomes will be increased visibility and awareness of a diversity of types of institutions in ecology and conservation communities.<br/><br/>In-person conference formats can exclude many scientists and environmental practitioners who can contribute to and benefit from the exchange of ideas and research that takes place at these events, including those from low-to-middle income countries, early career-researchers, student trainees, caregivers, and those from non-research-intensive institutions. In particular, limited knowledge sharing and exchange between academic and extra-academic audiences have stymied integration of research into management and environmental policies. This project will provide professional societies and individual scientists with evidence-based guidance to evaluate tradeoffs in access, participation, and conference experience, to design more equitable conferences that can increase knowledge exchange across institutional boundaries. Through a focus on integration of academic and extra-academic scientists from a diverse range of institutions, this work will also support student and early-career researchers in their need and desire for development toward extra-academic career paths. This project applies quantitative and semi-quantitative approaches to assess if virtual conferences facilitate access for individuals from more diverse institutions, logistical and cultural factors that can expand access, and conference features and formats that are most likely to support inclusion of student and early-career researchers from those institutions. We will accomplish this through analysis of conference attendance prior to and during the COVID-19 pandemic, surveys of current and prospective members of participating professional societies, and focus groups that iteratively identify approaches for testing as part of a future project. This project will produce multiple peer-reviewed publications, presentations, and an educational webinar.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Roughly speaking, microlocal analysis keeps track of the position and frequency, or momentum, of waves (or more generally, functions, such as the amplitudes and phases of waves) simultaneously. The planned applications are to wave propagation and other related phenomena, as well as inverse problems related to determining the structure of a material from surface measurements as well as to imaging by cosmic background radiation. Although the project concerns their mathematical theory, these problems are closely connected to the physical world. Wave propagation is ubiquitous in nature, with light and gravitational waves being important examples. Scattering theory of quantum particles is another subject governed by microlocal analysis: these aspects enter into the description of quantum waves at large distances. The inverse problems under study are also of broad significance: applications of the theory developed here include the determination of an unknown variable speed of elastic waves in an object via the measurement of travel times of waves, as well as the development of the universe through cosmic microwave background data. Many of the projects are suitable for research by doctoral students, and the PI strives to contribute to the education of a new generation of mathematicians and scientists.<br/><br/>Parts of the project describe the long-time or far field behavior, including existence, of waves, such as electromagnetic or gravitational waves, on curved space-times. The microlocal approach to analysis on these spaces has made breakthroughs possible in the PI's (in part collaborative) work on linear and nonlinear problems on asymptotically hyperbolic spaces as well as Kerr-de Sitter (KdS) space (rotating black holes in a cosmological spacetime), culminating in the proof of the stability of slowly rotating KdS spaces with Hintz. More recently, with Hafner and Hintz the PI extended some of these tools to the vanishing cosmological constant case (Minkowski, Kerr). The aim here is to extend these tools to further spaces, such as fast rotating KdS and perturbations of Kerr spacetimes. Other parts of the project study basic objects in quantum field theory, in particular the Feynman propagator. A novel direction, with Tripathy and Zimet, is construction of Ricci flat metrics on K3-type surfaces. Another main area is inverse problems, where the PI, together with Uhlmann, has introduced new tools for the spatially localized inversion of the geodesic X-ray transform, and with Stefanov and Uhlmann extended this to the boundary rigidity problem. A project with the PI's former postdoc Wang studies the light ray transform with potential applications to imaging by the cosmic background radiation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Thus, the development of rigorous statistical methods for reproducible and scalable analyses on such data sets, and the interdisciplinary training of a next generation of scientists who can straddle the computational and biomedical sciences, is crucial for our scientific advancement.   This project focuses on challenges in the analysis of data from single cell experiments, which are made possible by recent technological developments enabling genome-scale measurements to be made on individual cells, in high throughput across millions of cells at one go.  Such single cell experiments are now the bread-and-butter of biomedical research,  playing a cardinal role in our quest for a more complete understanding of cell biology as well as our pursuit of cures for every disease, from infectious diseases such as COVID-19 to cancer to aging-related maladies such as neurodegeneration.  Despite the promise of these new technologies, current methods for single cell data analysis are not designed for clinical-scale disease research, and do not adequately harness the information provided by the many recently completed single cell reference atlases, the latter realized through years of consortia-level efforts and millions of dollars in national funding.  This project aims to bridge this computational analysis gap, specifically by addressing two critical limitations in the field:  (1) The lack of a principled approach for the removal of unwanted technical variation from clinical-scale single cell sequencing studies, and (2) the need for an integrated approach to clinical-scale proteomic profiling that harness single cell reference atlases to achieve more precise cell type composition analysis.  For both problems, the project?s goal is to develop principled, transparent, and scalable methods for reproducible scientific research. Broader impacts of this project are its potential impact in improving the well-being of individuals in society; its contributions in STEM education for undergraduate and graduate students; and in the involvement and participation in research of women and under-represented minorities in STEM fields.<br/><br/>In more technical detail, the first aim of the project focuses on the removal of technical ?batch effects?.  Technical batch correction is an unavoidable and challenging step in *all* single cell data analysis pipelines.   Many methods have been proposed for batch effect correction in single cell experiments, but they were designed to align cells across all batches, ignoring design principles such as control cohorts, longitudinal sampling, and biological replicates.  Without utilizing these design principles, existing methods can not adequately estimate batch effects and often confound them with real biological signals.   Aim 1 of the project formulates new statistical methods for batch effect correction that are adaptable to a multitude of experimental designs and develops statistical inference procedures for quantifying the strength of biological signals (e.g. differential expression or emergence of a new cell type) accounting for the uncertainty in batch correction.  Aim 2 of the project tackles a different challenge arising in clinical-scale single cell proteomic profiling: Despite decreasing sequencing costs, flow and mass cytometry are still orders-of-magnitude faster and cheaper, and thus remains the method of choice in clinical-scale immunological studies where large cohorts need to be profiled on a tight timeline. However, each flow/mass cytometry run only measures a limited panel of proteins, and thus does not allow cell-type labelling at the  level of detail afforded by single cell transcriptomics. Aim 2 develops a new approach to cell type profiling that integrates multiple flow/mass cytometry runs, with complementary panels, on the same sample, with the goal of achieving cell-type tabulation accuracy matching state-of-the-art single cell sequencing protocols at only a fraction of time and cost.  This aim leverages the growing compendium of single cell reference atlases, providing a roadmap for the future use of these atlases in population-level cell type censusing projects.  Through collaborations, the developed methods will be applied to multiple ongoing large-cohort studies that have direct clinical impact. Methods developed in this project will be released as open-source software, and the datasets generated will be uploaded to public repository for general use.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Towards this end the project will focus particular attention on examples of how mathematical modeling and analysis can be used to reveal and investigate issues of social inequity that affect local communities where teachers may be placed. The investigators posit that such an approach will improve on more traditional mathematics instruction where students often leave class asking, ?Why do I need to know this??, and that it will illustrate how mathematics can be used to create a more socially just world. Additionally, instead of students leaving with a negative disposition toward the field of mathematics, this project will support teachers in creating joyful mathematical experiences that excite and engage students. Students who have a productive relationship with mathematics are more likely to pursue careers that require a mathematical background. Moreover, students who understand that mathematics has the power to describe the world can value mathematics beyond career choices; they can use mathematics to advocate for themselves and others when they see injustices in their community. By supporting preservice and beginning teachers in developing teaching philosophies and practices that highlight justice and joy in their lessons, more students are likely to engage with mathematics and see it as relevant to their lives.<br/><br/>This project at Boston University includes partnerships with the Boston Public Schools, Malden Public Schools, and Waltham Public Schools. Over a five-year period, the project intends to recruit a mix of 31 STEM professionals and highly talented post-baccalaureate students who possess a degree in a STEM discipline, most often mathematics, to teach secondary mathematics in a high-need school district. This project seeks to address the need for preparing and retaining highly effective secondary mathematics teachers in high-need-school districts who are properly trained in facilitating joyful mathematical experiences in the classroom while simultaneously increasing students? critical consciousness of how mathematics can illuminate issues of racism and other social injustices. This project will contribute to the improvement of mathematics education at the secondary level by pursuing the following two objectives. First is to generate an exemplary model for recruiting, training and retaining a diverse mathematics teacher community with a commitment to and facility with using examples of how mathematics can be applied to investigate issues of social justice. Second is to disseminate findings of this project through publications and conference presentations to teacher educators and researchers who study how teachers learn to implement and center justice-oriented mathematics. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

Paleontological studies have greatly increased our understanding of the ecological impacts of climate change and the extinction of large-bodied mammals at the end of the last Ice Age. Little is known, however, about how climate change, human impacts, and the loss of large mammals have shaped the ecology of the smallest extinction survivors: mammals under 3 kilograms (e.g., squirrels, rats and mice). This is despite the important and diverse roles that small mammals play in ecosystems. This knowledge gap is not only a problem for paleontology; ecologists also don?t fully understand the direct and indirect ways that climate change and human impacts are changing the ecosystems in which we live today. Studying how the smallest mammals have responded to major ecological disruption will thus help us better predict how mammalian communities today are likely to shift in the future. This is important because ecosystems today are often changing in ways we cannot predict using climate change alone. In addition to testing how small mammal communities have changed over time, this project will develop a Virtual Field Trip that will educate participants on the Great Basin?s natural and cultural histories. This activity will provide training to undergraduate and graduate students and a postdoctoral researcher and engage elementary age students and teachers in rural Oregon schools.<br/><br/>To meet this challenge, this research will use the paleontological and archaeological records of the Paisley and Connley Caves. The caves are in the northwestern Great Basin, a now-threatened ecoregion that was central to the peopling of the Western Hemisphere. Fossils will be used to estimate the diversity and function of small mammal communities from 17,000 years ago to today. Radiocarbon dating of these fossils, and surveys of modern small mammals, will help answer questions about how climate change and human presence have together shaped biodiversity in the past and the present. The research will also study how small mammal communities today differ from what they were like just before European contact.

IoT-enabled manufacturing systems have a physical fabric woven from a heterogeneous mix of machines carrying and processing materials across the factory floor. The cyber fabric for these systems is a heterogeneous mix of wired and wireless digital communication networks enabling the global visibility of the data streams used to manage the physical fabric?s workflows. These IoT-enabled systems are complex CPS with a great deal of modeling uncertainty. The physical and cyber fabrics are open to an external environment that can shift in an abrupt and unpredictable manner. Such shifts may be due to changes in customer work orders or due to environmental changes that cause traffic congestion in the cyber fabric?s wireless networks. The dynamics of both fabrics are coupled since congestion in the physical fabric may create congestion in the cyber fabric and vice versa. This complexity and uncertainty stand as major obstacles to the broader acceptance of IoT technologies by U.S. manufacturers. To lower the risk in adopting IoT technologies, this project proposes developing meta-learning methods that learn how to control complex CPS found in IoT-enabled manufacturing.  This project will develop algorithms and software implementations of the meta-learning approach to controlling CPS.  The project will benchmark the method?s performance on a testbed capturing the complex interactions between an IoT-manufacturing system?s physical and cyber fabrics. <br/><br/>This project uses meta-learning algorithms for the control of complex and uncertain cyber-physical systems. The approach adopts a new type of machine learning model called a behaviorally ordered abstraction (BOA). This model has greater cross-task generalization capacity, better sample efficiency, and greater interpretability than other deep learning methods. This modeling approach allows the project to address issues regarding the robust stability of deep reinforcement learning by embedding meta-learning in a generalized regulator that learns ?how? to configure controller synthesis across all tasks. This project will evaluate the project?s ?learning-how-to-control? framework on a multi-robotic testbed mimicking the use of WIFI connected robots moving materials across a factory floor.  The project will investigate how to transfer the models and policies learned on the testbed to IoT-enabled factories found in local manufacturing facilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Furthermore, there are no good tools to manipulate and measure pHi in single cells thereby limiting progress in this field.

For the Broader Impacts of this project, the PI will develop a transformative education program to explore scientific research as a creative endeavor. This includes developing project-based learning curriculum for undergraduate students and implementing activity-based learning modules for STEAM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Art, and Mathematics) education in middle school art classrooms.

If the climatic and rock type details are constrained, then aspects of topography, like the shape of rivers, can serve as proxies for details of the tectonic forces and reveal, for example, the location and relative activity of faults. While providing critical insight into active tectonics, these approaches tend to idealize rock uplift along faults as a steady process. However, in reality rock uplift and the growth of topography usually occurs through more punctuated processes, specifically long periods of slow distributed deformation between earthquakes and then sudden and violent deformation during earthquakes, which combined over millennia, result in the integrated and idealized average rock uplift. The extent to which details of this ?seismic cycle? are preserved in topography is unclear, but unlocking potential records stored in topography would be transformative as it could provide insight into specifics critical for hazard assessments, like average time between earthquakes and the relative extents of earthquake ruptures, through relatively quick, easy, and cheap analyses from globally available topography data. This project explores the preservation potential of aspects of the seismic cycle through a two-pronged approach. First, a large and comprehensive suite of simulations of landscapes developing through successive earthquake events and with varying climate and lithology details are being used to develop a set of fingerprints for relating landscape form to earthquake details. Secondly, these fingerprints are being applied to regions with independently established histories of fault and earthquake activity to vet and refine the results from the simulations. The broad goal of this research is providing a critical set of tools for better understanding earthquake hazards, both domestically and abroad in regions that lack comprehensive seismic hazard assessments and improve the safety and security of populations living in regions of potential hazard. In addition to the research goals of this project, a set of unique educational tools to provide resources for understanding the ways in which topography more generally reflects the shaping tectonic and climatic forces is being developed. The results of this effort include a LandscapeLibrary, a large set of landscape simulations developed under a wide array of controlled conditions, which will be made available to the public through an interactive web interface. Additionally, a series of educational exercises which use the LandscapeLibrary are being developed for a range of education levels from secondary to graduate level, providing a far-reaching educational resource that will contribute to development of the STEM workforce and promote general understanding of the critical context for the surface of the Earth.<br/><br/>Fundamental details of the tectonic history of actively deforming regions are encoded in their fluvial topography, but interpreting these histories requires full consideration of the array of forcing mechanisms contributing to their form. For example, significant prior work focused on the influence of spatially or temporally variable precipitation, variations in lithologic resistance to erosion, or autogenic processes within catchments, amongst others in complicating, the interpretation of tectonics from topography and the extent to which these additional forcings can be factored out and a meaningful tectonic signal can still be reliably extracted from fluvial topography. The tectonic signals interpreted from this topography typically are first-order characteristics of fault systems, e.g., the location and relative activity of major structures, their subsurface geometries, or temporal changes in their average slip rates, but which largely treat the deformation on faults, and resulting patterns in rock uplift driving topographic development, simplistically as rigid block motion. However, fault motion typically occurs seismically and with significant spatial variability in surface deformation within a single seismic cycle, and indeed, likely between seismic cycles driven by interseismic creep on non-locked portions of fault and strain accumulation on locked portions of faults which is released coseismically. The extent to which the seismic cycle influences the development of topography is fundamentally unknown, but a general assumption is that it can be safely ignored, and that topography reflects average slip rates and associated rates of rock uplift. However, some work has questioned this assumption, specifically whether a signal of incomplete recovery of interseismic strain by earthquakes may leave a signal in topography. More broadly, it remains unclear whether topography can record any details of the seismic cycle, but it is hypothesized in this project that it may, specifically because of interactions between the seismic cycle and other forcing mechanisms, such as spatially and temporally variable precipitation. This project is testing this hypothesis with an integrated modeling study coupled with a large-scale topographic analysis effort. Specifically, the project seeks to 1) use coupled surface processes and deformation models that simulate interseismic and coseismic deformation to identify topographic signatures of the seismic cycle and 2) assess whether these signals are recognizable in natural landscapes with independent constraint on at least parts of their seismic cycles. The project will provide crucial insight into the connections between the long-term topography developed in active deforming regions and short-term earthquake processes, which is a long-standing goal within both the tectonics and earth surface processes communities. This project follows recent efforts that attempt to use the topographic characteristics of simulated landscapes to extract more quantitative information from topography directly, e.g., estimation of slip rate magnitudes, but promises to extend our view to details of the seismic cycle and fault behavior. These details of the seismic cycle are a fundamental input for seismic hazard analysis, which is of great societal relevance, but extracting this critical information is often challenging, laborious, and expensive. As such, being able to assess even broad information about the seismic cycle of a fault system from something as ubiquitous and globally accessible as topography would be incredibly beneficial - and is a potential outcome from the proposed work. This effort will occur in tandem with the development of a large body of precomputed synthetic landscapes developed under diverse forcing conditions to build the LandscapeLibrary and an interface for easy access and visualization of this library. This resource, and educational materials developed with it, are designed to help provide an easy visual representation of landscape evolution for a variety of classroom purposes. The LandscapeLibrary will provide an invaluable resource for other geoscientist educators around the world who wish to provide their students an intuitive view of the diverse forcing on landscape evolution.

However, objects in the real world are usually not smooth. One of the insights of modern mathematics is that many non-smooth objects can be studied and understood just as thoroughly as their smooth counterparts. Even more, such study tends to clarify and simplify previously known classical theory. Research in geometry, in both the smooth and non-smooth settings, typically involves curvature?a measure of the ?bending? of a space?as a fundamental notion. The aim of this project is to understand the structure of geometric spaces in maximum generality, without relying on curvature and other standard assumptions. Such an undertaking has intrinsic interest and is also motivated by neighboring subjects such as complex dynamics and geometric group theory where these spaces naturally arise. Non-smooth geometry also arises in a variety of applied fields, including theoretical computer science and data science.  This project also incorporates a range of questions that will provide opportunities for undergraduate research.<br/><br/>This project is rooted in the classical uniformization theorem developed by Klein, Poincar and Koebe, among others, which states that any smooth surface can be mapped conformally onto a surface of constant curvature. This theorem gives a simple yet comprehensive picture of the geometry of surfaces and is the culmination of a large portion of 19th century mathematics. The project has two main goals: first is to develop versions of the uniformization theorem for potentially non-smooth metric spaces: to determine when one space can be mapped to another under a map with good geometric properties, such as a quasiconformal, quasisymmetric or bi-Lipschitz map. This continues earlier work of the principal investigator using a novel polyhedral approximation scheme as the main method. This approximation scheme has further potential applications which will be explored. The second goal is to investigate a variety of additional problems related to the different geometric classes of maps. These include the factorization of bi-Lipschitz maps and extensions of Lipschitz and quasisymmetric maps. These questions capture fundamental aspects of metric spaces and maps between them.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Subgraph mining in a big graph increasingly relies on parallel and distributed computing to scale the data processing volume and velocity. Numerous central processing unit (CPU)-based systems have been developed to parallelize graph mining algorithms. However, our nation is replacing CPU supercomputers with graphics processing unit (GPU) supercomputers faster than ever before, with the expectation that heterogeneous CPU/GPUs will not only boost performance but also conserve energy. This trend poses difficulties for large-scale graph processing, as users must design GPU programs tailored to each individual graph problem. The project?s novelties are: 1) a new graph parallel and distributed framework will be developed, which will accelerate graph computations in a GPU-rich environment; 2) multiple graph mining tasks, including dense subgraph mining and subgraph matching, will be implemented atop this framework to take advantage of the massive parallelism of multi-GPUs. The project's impacts are: 1) it serves a number of cross-disciplinary projects, such as bioinformatics and chem-informatics 2) this project will be released for public use and will enrich existing courses related to big data and parallel computing, thereby providing long-term benefits to the scientific community.<br/><br/>This project aims to build on the success in scaling graph processing in a multi-CPU environment and investigate novel task-based techniques to scale fundamental compute-intensive graph operations in a multi-GPU environment. Existing GPU algorithms impose a memory restriction because of the restricted size of GPU memory, which limits the size of input graphs that can be processed. This project will explore effective representation schemes that encode and compress the input graph and intermediate subgraph results compactly to minimize the memory footprint of the GPU. This will enable coalesced global memory access and enable data reuse in shared memory. GPU-friendly task-based algorithms will be designed for fundamental graph operations including subgraph matching and dense subgraph mining, to unleash the massive parallelism enabled by a multi-GPU environment. All graph mining pruning rules will be carefully re-designed using the GPU advanced warp-level primitives in association with the new task schemes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chemical reactivity of analytes adsorbed to an electrode depends on the underlying crystallinity of a surface as well as its adjacent grains. Studying these effects require the use of methods that reveal surface crystallography, depend on the electrode surface electronic state and symmetry, and impact local vibrational information about the adsorbed molecules. By controlling the system electrochemically, Professor Baldelli and his students will map surface chemistry and link it to underlying crystallography to develop a physical understanding of how crystalline domains influence heterogeneous catalysis.

Students will develop skills related to instrument building, data analysis, and spectral and microscopy image interpretation.<br/><br/>This project uses in situ sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy/microscopy (SFG) to probe molecules adsorbed to an electrode while second harmonic generation microscopy (SHG) assists in the determination of the electronic state and symmetry of the electrode. Because SHG anisotropy is related to surface crystallography, the combination of these techniques results in the generation of correlated maps of surface chemistry and underlying crystallography. Surface reactivity is then interrogated using cyclic voltammetry with sub-micron resolution under reaction conditions. In so doing, impacts of adjacent grains in a polycrystalline surface are evaluated.

These technologies all use carefully prepared light waves to effectively measure or communicate with the world around us. An important part of developing these technologies is developing compact and efficient components which control both direction and orientation of the light. The capabilities of each component are critically determined by the materials used in their construction, and how light interacts with these materials. Notably, by using unconventional materials, scientists can generate new types of light propagation, and make optical components both smaller and more efficient.  In this project, the research team will determine how certain classes of crystals can be used to control both direction and orientation of light waves. By coupling light to a class of crystals having a parallelepiped structure, it becomes possible to engineer a unique light-matter interactions not seen in materials with simpler structures. By performing these studies, the principal investigator and team will discover new design paradigms for creating optical components exploiting this class of crystals. A key part of this is developing educational tools which can be used to educate the future photonics workforce on how these materials work and can be utilized. We will specifically work with two different groups ? middle school and junior undergraduate students, which typically receive limited education on photonics and the impact on modern technologies. In the former case, we will work closely with middle-school teachers to develop a series of lesson plans to target curriculum relevant skills, including concepts in photonics. Our work with junior undergraduates will then build on this, introducing research-like projects into the curriculum to build key analysis skills required for the future quantum and semiconductor workforces. Those efforts will be distributed online, which will allow teachers nationally to access resources developed as part of this program.<br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/>The research focuses on understanding how light can propagate in crystals with low crystalline symmetry.  Coupling light to materials with inherently low symmetry produces shear polaritons, a phenomenon that can enhance a specific range and orientation of wave vectors; this is not possible in more conventional materials. Similarly, shear polaritons can offer control over the polarization state, including the potential to realize photons with high angular orbital momentum. This wave vector selectivity offers insensitivity to scattering, which would enable the development of high-efficiency devices. However, there is a clear and critical need to better understand the materials in which these form, to leverage their unique chiral properties for photonics with control over directionality and polarization. This study is designed to provide a framework for identifying materials that produce strong shear phenomena, as well as determining how they can be applied in developing future photonic technologies. The utilization of natural crystal systems reduces the requirements for complex nanostructure designs, reducing the cost associated with the new phenomena. The team envision the creation of light sources through long-wave infrared range that emit with high directionality linear, circular, or vortex polarized beams, in the absence of external optics. This will be achieved over three objectives. (i) Create a framework for understanding polariton propagation and scattering in the lowest symmetry crystals, (ii) Demonstrate polaritonic emission in low symmetry excitonic materials for asymmetric photoemission, (iii) Enhance photonic materials education toward the goal of developing a future quantum workforce. By the end of these objectives, the team will have understood the key material and optical properties, which will enable development of technologies based on the unique properties of shear polaritons.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Electronic and Photonic Materials (EPM) program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The data can include a variety of physiological information, such as brain activity, heart rate, and/or blood pressure. By analyzing medical time series data, researchers and healthcare providers can gain a better understanding of how a patient's health is changing and make predictions about future outcomes. Artificial intelligence (AI) models can be very helpful in uncovering insights from medical data and understanding the progression of a disease. However, using AI techniques can require a large number of high-quality professional annotations (notes by healthcare providers), which can be costly and hard to obtain. For example, while devices in intensive care units can continuously monitor vital signs, physicians may only have the time to review and annotate a small portion of the data to note important events. Moreover, the annotations may not be reliable because doctors may have different opinions patients or events. To this end, this project will build innovative technologies to provide insightful understanding of a patient?s health with minimal expert input. Overall, this project aims to promote the development of smart healthcare, relieve the burden on physicians, and enhance the quality of life.<br/><br/>This project will develop a novel self-supervised contrastive framework to learn representations from medical time series data. Specifically, the project will focus on the following tasks: (1) developing a frequency-aware contrastive framework for unimodal time series data, which leverages the cohesion between time-based and frequency-based representations of the same sample; (2) applying the established framework to analyze Electroencephalography (EEG) signals for the diagnosis of Alzheimer's Disease (AD); (3) extending the framework to multimodal medical time series data by constructing a medical graph that models the dependencies among diverse medical entities and integrates representations through graph message passing; and (4) applying the resulting model to predict clinical outcomes using multimodal vital signals, with a focus on improving interpretability through the learned graph attention weights. The investigator will disseminate the benefits of self-supervised methods to the medical community, and organize special issues and workshops to promote research in weakly-supervised methods for healthcare. This project, thereby, will further lay the groundwork for augmenting the medical system with advanced AI models, and reduce the burden on physicians by accelerating the decision-making process.

A key strategy to be used relies on these partnerships for opportunities to establish students? interest in teaching secondary mathematics at high-need schools and eventually enroll participants in a Bachelor?s/Master?s curricular pathway to secondary mathematics teaching. Founded on standards-based instruction and tenets of culturally responsive teaching, the Bachelor?s/Master?s curricular pathway will focus on examinations of instructional practices that best address the complex demands of teaching in high-need schools.

High mechanical hardness is a very desirable property for materials used in industrial settings for machining and cutting as it dramatically reduces wear and therefore turnover rate of machining tools. The industry standard superhard material is diamond, the hardest material currently known. The issue that arises with diamond, however, is that not only does it have an expensive high pressure, high temperate synthesis, but it is limited in its applications. This is because it is thermally unstable in air and when used to cut iron containing materials, diamond breaks down to form iron carbides. These both result in a high turnover rate for diamond tools, and an inability to be used with common iron containing materials, like steel.  Cheaper alternatives such as tungsten carbide (WC) have an easier, low-cost synthesis, but lack the extremely high hardness values of diamond and therefore have high turnover rates and are less effective. With this project, supported by the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program and the Ceramics program, both in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, the principal investigators design and create superhard materials that approach the high hardness seen in diamond, while replicating the low cost, ambient pressure synthesis found in WC. These superhard materials made from boron not only lower the cost of synthesis, but they improve the lifetime of the tools that can be created and therefore, lower the amount of waste generated in industrial machining. Additionally, the metallic nature of these transition metal borides enables the use of high precision cutting and shaping instruments like plasma cutting, which is currently not usable with electrically insulating materials like diamond, which additionally reduces cost and waste in the formation of these tools. Beyond this research, the principal investigators undertake educational outreach in the greater Los Angeles area. This includes developing lessons and experiments for K-12 schools and presenting them to teachers, along with speaking to students in grade school about not just science, but higher education as a whole. Graduate students who work on this project also gain valuable skills through both the research they conduct as well as through the mentorship and outreach programs they participate in alongside their mentors. <br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/>Hardness is a mechanical property that is defined by a material?s ability to resist irreversible shape change, known as plastic deformation. The hardness of a given material is dependent on several different materials? properties, but they can overall be grouped into two categories: intrinsic bonding effects and grain boundary effects.  These two contributors to hardness are not mutually exclusive and therefore can be optimized separately and combined to dramatically improve the hardness of a material.  This project, with support from the Solid State and Materials Chemistry program and the Ceramics program, both in NSF?s Division of Materials Research, uses the described two-pronged approach towards superhard materials design and combines the synthesis of transition metal boride systems with high-pressure studies to obtain information about the internal deformation mechanisms of bulk and nanocrystalline materials. The research groups at UC Los Angeles study how small element doping into the boron sites of the metal borides affects the bonding. Using systems of di- and tetra- borides with varying amounts of carbon in them, the principal investigators investigate the different carbon bonding regimes, and their impact on hardness. Additionally, synthetic routes for the formation of nanostructured metal borides are explored. The principal investigators utilize new synthetic routes to create nanocrystalline forms of known superhard metal borides such as ReB2, WB2 and WB4 to further increase the hardness of these materials by maximizing the number of grain boundaries which can impede plastic deformation. These nanocrystalline materials also allow for new analytical techniques which are not possible for bulk materials such as Rietveld texture analysis. These two approaches to hardening metal borides can then be combined to create nanocrystalline solid solutions which benefit from both the improved bonding effects and grain boundary effects. The broader impacts of the project are multifaceted and include extensive outreach conducted by the principal investigators aimed at grade school children, the training of both graduate and undergraduate students in their Ph.D. studies and undergraduate research opportunities, respectively, and the development of novel superhard materials which have the potential to improve the quality of industrial manufacturing and machining tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, there is building evidence that many marine sediments can also serve as a sink for CO2. The microbial processes that fuel this ?dark? carbon fixation are poorly understood. Mineral oxidation, such as iron or sulfur oxidation, are thought to be important drivers of dark carbon fixation, but poor characterization of these metabolisms means we lack the tools necessary to identify and quantify these physiologies in the field. This is especially true for detection with commonly used sequencing-based approaches, which depend on having marker genes or proteins that inform the metabolic potential for a process. This work is investigating biomarkers for mineral oxidation in distinct microbial lineages, thus expanding our current understanding of the breadth and diversity of mineral oxidation mechanisms, and the role they play in carbon cycling and sequestration in marine sediments. In addition to the environmental relevance of these organisms and processes, the ability to oxidize solid phase minerals, often lends itself to interaction with redox active surfaces such as poised potential electrodes. As such, understanding these mechanisms also provides insight into the potential for microbe electrode technologies. <br/><br/>This grant is investigating the genes and pathways used by several marine sediments microbes for oxidative extracellular electron transfer (EET) for mineral oxidation. The subject microorganisms were previously isolated from Catalina Harbor and are known to have unique electrochemical properties. Genomically, they lack homology to known EET pathways. Application of either high throughput genetic techniques (Tn-Seq), or gene expression studies (RNA-seq), depending on the specific strain studied is being used for gene identification. Putative biomarkers identified in this work are being confirmed genetically. The education component of this grant uses one of these strains in a course based undergraduate research experience for a second semester Intro-biology lab. The physiologic and genomic work performed thus far point to a potential role for EET in various sulfur-oxidizing metabolisms. Investigating the role of sulfur minerals in supporting microbial metabolism, is occurring using microbial anabolism with bio-orthogonal non-canonical amino acid tagging (BONCAT) in parallel with either spectroscopic techniques (Raman, XRD, etc.) or fluorescent activated cell sorting coupled to metagenomic sequencing in Catalina harbor sediments. As many of the microbes isolated from this sediment are capable of lithotrophic interaction with sulfur, it is hypothesized that sulfur species are playing an important role in supporting microbial metabolism, and dark carbon fixation in this system?likely using EET to use or storing solid phase sulfur minerals, and/or developing a conductive network to bridge spatial gaps between the oxidants and reductants. <br/><br/>This project is cofunded by the Biological Oceanography and Geobiology and Low-temperature Geochemistry Programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

K-12 is the critical stage for youth to develop knowledge of and interest in AI. This project will leverage the interdisciplinarity of AI to create learning opportunities for secondary students from diverse backgrounds. Focusing on natural language-based AI, this project will develop and research a novel AI Across the Curriculum program that integrates AI concepts and practices into the existing high school curriculum. The project team will develop and test a two-hour introductory module and three five-hour modules for mathematics, English language arts (ELA), and history, as well as a 60-hour professional development program for teachers to develop the competencies required to implement the modules. Teachers in math, ELA, and history will implement the modules in a coordinated fashion to offer learning experiences that are coherent across the different disciplines to their students. During the project, 12 teachers and 900 students will directly benefit from participation in the program. The output of the project will advance national prosperity through AI workforce development by enabling high schools to provide high-quality AI education to all students, especially African Americans, Latinx, and females, who are the underrepresented and underserved groups in the field of AI. The project will be led by an interdisciplinary team of AI developers and educators, STEM and humanities educators, learning scientists and designers, and experts on diversity, equity, and inclusion at the Concord Consortium, Carnegie Mellon University, and North Carolina State University. The team will partner with the San Joaquin County Office of Education in California and the Maryland Center for Computing Education and work closely with two school districts, one in CA and one in MD, that serve student populations underrepresented and underserved in the field of AI. <br/><br/>Researchers will address three research questions: 1) How do students? social and disciplinary identities shape their participation in learning of AI knowledge and AI-rich careers? Guided by the intersectional identity theory, the project will capture eight focal students? learning processes with repeated interviews, video, audio, and screencast recordings, and computer logs. These data will be analyzed using the personal narratives framework and ethnomethodological and conversation-analytic approaches. 2) What and how are new ideas generated by teachers as they seek to coordinate their efforts to integrate AI across the curriculum? Based on the community of practice theory, the project will capture teachers? idea generation and transaction processes with Professional Development (PD) recordings, online communications, and interviews. These data will be analyzed using the idea authorship framework. 3) To what extent, for whom, and under what conditions does the AI Across the Curriculum program support students to develop knowledge of and interest in AI-rich careers? The demographic and academic backgrounds of 900 students and 12 teachers will be collected via surveys to determine the impact of this approach. An AI & Machine Learning Core Concepts Questionnaire and an AI-Rich Careers Questionnaire will be administered before and after the curriculum. These data will be analyzed quantitatively to determine to what extent, for whom, and under what conditions the modules are beneficial. Through research publications and professional learning resources, the project will increase the capacity of educators and researchers to advance AI education. All technologies, curriculum modules, assessments, and PD materials will be freely available to the public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Perovskites used in the most efficient devices to date absorb light in the red and near-infrared. This corresponds to a band gap of 1.2 to 1.8 electron volts (eV), with an eV being the amount of energy needed to move an electron across an electric potential of one volt. It is desirable to develop high quality materials with higher band gaps to capture more of the sun?s energy in a solar cell or emit green or blue light from an LED. The team hypothesizes that perovskites with three different halide atoms could realize these high-quality materials with increased band gaps. The team will fabricate triple-halide perovskites and thoroughly characterize their structure, composition and properties. In doing so the team will expand the range of viable perovskites for device applications. This work will be done collaboratively between the University of Colorado Boulder and Wellesley College. Wellesley College is a diverse women?s undergraduate college, where a majority of the incoming class identifies as people of color. Wellesley College undergraduates work closely with researchers at major academic institutions and national laboratories. This greatly increases their research opportunities and provides students with exposure to graduate programs. This project will serve to support that population and expand STEM opportunities.<br/><br/>Technical Description<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to synthesize high performance all-inorganic perovskite semiconductors with bandgaps between 1.9 and 2.1 eV. The performance of current wide bandgap perovskites is limited by non-radiative recombination and environmental instability.  Triple halide perovskites are hypothesized to have desirable properties because there will be no opportunity for demixing to occur at the A-site, chlorine will passivate defects, the small lattice parameter will result in strong bonds and there will be no organic cation that could decompose. The team will investigate a range of promising triple halide perovskites, leveraging its expertise to characterize and understand the miscible composition space; map and understand the instabilities in these materials; and ultimately quantify and optimize the optoelectronic properties of select triple halide perovskites. The team will determine how solution chemistry impacts perovskite nucleation, film growth and performance and resultant optoelectronic properties and stability. The team will document improvements using cyclic voltammetry, in situ photoluminescence and absorption spectroscopy, and X-ray diffraction to map defect densities and barriers to degradation. This project is working towards (1) optimized synthesis of novel triple halide perovskites; (2) quantification of the stability of wide bandgap perovskites and optoelectronic performance; and (3) improved interfacial layers for surface passivation and carrier selection in wide bandgap perovskites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

CRISPR can be used for guided edits of selected genomic targets. Multiple variants and extensions of CRISPR are actively being used by researchers for editing, knockout, activation and inhibition of genes and genomic elements for studying cell function and identification of important cellular regulators. Computational algorithms and software for experimental design are essential for continued successful use of the CRISPR technologies. However, fundamental molecular mechanisms and optimal parameters of efficient and targeted use of CRISPR technologies across entire genomes are not fully characterized. Limitations in current computational methods for design and analysis of CRISPR experiments include lack of complete unbiased genome-wide information about CRISPR off-targets across biological and experimental contexts, across cell types and across CRISPR variants; lack of specificity to genomes and genomic variants across individuals, cohorts and populations; and incomplete understanding of biases in results of CRISPR experiments caused by off-targets. These limitations present barriers for wider adoption of CRISPR technologies in life sciences and biomedicine. This project is devoted to overcoming these limitations and developing new computational methodology for design and analysis of CRISPR experiments. Fully integrated with this research plan, an educational and outreach program will be developed in order to involve undergraduate and high school students into open collaborative computational biology research. This work will substantially lower the bar for using CRISPR technologies across a wide range of applications and will inform the development of the next generation of such technologies. Implementation of this educational and outreach plan will make entering research careers in bioinformatics and computational biology substantially more accessible for the next generation of students, and will encourage wet lab biologists to obtain computational biology training and to productively collaborate with computational scientists.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to address major challenges in CRISPR low- and high-throughput experimental design and analysis via a combination of computational and experimental approaches.

Indeed, the higher education STEM enterprise has seen decreasing student interest in science, due in no small part to the pandemic; and these circumstances have brought new challenges in the classroom related to student performance. Faculty must adapt and learn how to address students' changing learning patterns. After several years of working remotely, faculty are eager to network and learn exciting and effective methods to teach their students. They will have the opportunity to do this at a three day in-person conference, supported with funding from this project. An essential part of this project is to impart best practices to capture and retain student interest in science. Speakers will share approaches to help shape the next generation of science students through engagement in both the classroom and teaching laboratory. National experts at the conference will guide and develop up-and-coming faculty leaders on how to address the needs of a diverse generation. As a result of this project, a diverse group of faculty will have increased access to the experts and tools to help students succeed and persist in STEM.<br/><br/>This project will support and promote the participation of faculty and post-doctoral fellows from marginalized groups and individuals from under-resourced institutions to attend a transformative educational conference organized by the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology. The conference seeks to 1) develop leaders in education, 2) introduce current and prospective faculty to ongoing NSF-funded projects to encourage broader participation, and 3) promote effective approaches to diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) initiatives that result in positive and impactful changes. There is a need to retain students from all backgrounds in the life sciences, and while the field of inclusive pedagogy has developed some best practices, the work has not been disseminated to all life science educators. At this meeting, faculty will hear from leaders in the field about growth mindset and discipline-specific education research. Secondly, for faculty to continue to grow professionally, they need to have leadership skills and develop their networks, and the conference will have a session on this topic. Faculty will also learn from seven NSF-funded high-impact projects supporting learning and engaging students. The intellectual merit and the general expected outcomes are an increase in faculty involvement in one or more of the high-impact practices, self-reflection on their personal and professional development, and support of their integration of DEI approaches to help engage and retain all students. The broader impacts of the project are the potential to drive institutional change in the context of STEM student and faculty support. The approaches presented by the NSF-funded groups will help disseminate their work and encourage further engagement with new participants. Each participant will have the opportunity to be an agent of change in their department and institution with the skills learned at the conference, bringing about an impact beyond a single classroom. The meeting will be evaluated with a pre- and post-survey and a long-term follow-up survey asking the faculty about the impact of the meeting. The results of the meeting have already been approved to be disseminated in the peer-reviewed journal, Biochemistry and Molecular Biology Education.

Modern variants of this old problem turn out to be central to understanding various types of phenomena in areas ranging from analysis, partial differential equations, combinatorics, number theory and even computer science. The last two decades saw tremendous progress on this family of problems with the introduction of several influential techniques, which have later found use in attacking other hard problems. Despite this exciting progress, several core issues remain unsolved even today. The goal of this project is to find ways to make progress on those hard instances of the Kakeya problem in finite settings where existing techniques fail. The problems the PI will study are rooted in combinatorics but have applications in other areas, including in computer science. One of the goals of this project is to further strengthen these connections by finding new applications and expanding on known ones. Graduate students will be trained as part of this project.<br/><br/>The specific research goals of this project are grouped into four main topics: (1) High-dimensional variants of the finite field Kakeya problem. The PI and co-authors made significant progress in the past few years on these variants but many important open problems still remain. In particular, reducing the field size and understanding better the newly discovered connections to linear hash functions. (2) Arithmetic progressions variants of the Kakeya problem. These variants are notoriously difficult and could potentially lead to the resolution of the Kakeya conjecture over the reals. We identify several ?intermediate difficulty? variants of these problems in the hope that these could lead to the development of new techniques. (3) Abstract Kakeya problems: We describe an abstract framework for studying Kakeya-type problems and suggest a potential connection to Locally Decodable Codes (codes important in theoretical computer science). (4) Finally, we describe a novel reinterpretation of finite Kakeya type problems as relaxations of integer optimization problems and suggest that these could be studied using tools from real optimization.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such systems are of utmost importance in the physical sciences and in a world where social media and communication networks constantly generate huge data sets. This project aims to develop theoretical tools in high dimensional probability via two methods. The first method will exploit the intuition that in many practical situations, although the system contains numerous degrees of freedom, the relevant information is contained in a much smaller set of variables. The project will aim to quantify this intuition by developing the notion of intrinsic dimensionality. The second method aims to represent a given complex system as the transformation of a much simpler system. The project also includes educational efforts, including mentoring undergraduate and graduate students, and the dissemination of the work in professional meetings and to the public. <br/><br/>The long-term goal is to improve understanding of high-dimensional probability measures via two approaches.  The first approach is to develop an original concept of intrinsic dimensionality in the context of functional inequalities. The notion of dimension plays a crucial role in functional inequalities via the curvature-dimension condition, but it ignores the fact that the measures of interest can live on lower-dimensional spaces. This omission can lead to inefficient functional inequalities; this project hopes to bridge this gap. The second approach is to develop new measure transportation methods based on stochastic processes and probabilistic flows. For example, Lipschitz transport maps provide a powerful way to transfer functional inequalities from simple source measures to complicated target measures. Only a few such Lipschitz transport maps are known to exist, which limits the applicability of the transport method. The project will utilize the tools of stochastic analysis and renormalization group methods to build transport maps with desirable regularity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will explore the design of an accelerated fully online Master of Arts in Teaching (MAT) program to provide initial teaching licenses and support for induction into the teaching profession for these career changers. As part of this Capacity Building project, avenues of access will be designed to allow working professionals the quality, flexibility, and collaboration needed for success in the redesigned online master?s degree. The project will also be responsive to the ongoing needs of busy working adults throughout the process. The expected outcomes of this capacity building exploration will identify enrollment targets, unique marketing strategies, and support structures needed to ensure development of a successful model program.<br/><br/>This project at Dordt University (DU) explores the partnerships needed with the university?s constituencies around the country. Its focus will be on school districts and school associations in the immediate region and in areas that are part of DU?s network of 80 historically connected pockets of DU constituents around the U.S. currently seeking STEM teachers. Project goals include soliciting input from stakeholders, assessing needs for STEM teachers in constituent areas, and assessing interest among STEM graduates. Another goal is to evaluate existing graduate and undergraduate curricula regarding an adult-friendly path to initial licensure. Once this exploration demonstrates an MAT program to be promising, the outcome will be the design of a unique online master?s program for working STEM professionals. The design will include marketing, hiring, and advising plans for quickly implementing the program. The project will identify specific targets for enrollment, licensing, and first-year success rates. The format will alleviate common barriers to career changing such as a long teacher training program, the need to attend classes on campus during work hours, emergency or temporary licenses, and the lack of relevant or convenient field experiences. The envisioned online program will include best practices such as early practicum experiences, a standard licensing path, adult learning theory, induction mentorships, and a multi-faceted assessment system. The broader impact of this project rests on the assumption that it is never too late to go into teaching and that high-need and rural schools deserve and can have high quality STEM teachers. This, in turn, can lead to more STEM interest among students in those schools. This exploration phase will be evaluated on the amount of concrete data and direction provided for planning the envisioned program.

Fundamental theoretical questions concern identifying universal pattern-forming mechanisms and predicting the nature and dynamics of the patterns which appear. This project aims to address these questions through the study of pattern-forming instabilities in the setting of partial differential equations (PDEs) arising in models from biology, ecology, and chemical reactions.  In particular, the project focuses on the development of techniques to tackle pattern formation in PDEs which are singularly perturbed; such equations arise naturally in the study of systems where components operate on widely differing length or time scales. Application areas include desertification fronts in dryland ecosystems, as well as wave phenomena in mathematical biology and neuroscience. Included in the project are activities which integrate research and education through the supervision of graduate students as well as outreach programs and summer research opportunities for undergraduate students.<br/><br/>This project focuses on three primary research areas, with the goal of providing insight into complex spatiotemporal pattern formation phenomena in singularly perturbed reaction diffusion PDEs. Motivated by the phenomenon of desertification fronts in dryland ecosystems, the first research area concerns pattern-forming instabilities of bistable planar interfaces in multi-component reaction diffusion systems. The second area aims to build a rigorous theory of temporal pulse replication, by which a single traveling pulse (or localized wave) self-replicates, sequentially nucleating additional pulses in a manner resembling a spatiotemporal canard explosion. The third area is concerned with the nature and properties of far-from-onset patterns formed in the wake of pattern-forming invasion processes, whereby a pattern is nucleated when a disturbance invades an unstable steady state. These research areas will grow and advance the theory of far-from-onset pattern-forming mechanisms through the development of geometric singular perturbation methods and spatial dynamical systems tools to be used in the existence, stability, and bifurcation analysis of waves and patterns. Several of the phenomena explored in this project occur in regions where standard singular perturbation methods break down, requiring the development of novel techniques.

Neuroprotective drugs have limited efficacy, thus indicating a set of undiscovered causes behind these diseases. Besides some well-known risk factors such as aging, clinical and epidemiological studies have shown that exposure to heavy metals can initiate the death of neuron cells. Moreover, based on biochemistry-related computational modeling, several mechanisms have been proposed to explain the effects of heavy metal exposure on various neurodegenerative diseases. Because of the lack of proper tools to perform real-time measurements in living systems, researchers study heavy metals in postmortem tissue samples or urine and blood obtained from patients. However, such studies or theoretical models do not accurately represent the measurements inside living systems. Additionally, current studies mainly focus on identifying one chemical messenger molecule or neurotransmitter at a time. Thus, an improved understanding of interactions among neurotransmitters and other elements, such as heavy metals, is needed. This research will focus on developing a novel, robust electrochemical sensor that can perform ultra-fast, simultaneous measurements of heavy metals and multiple neurotransmitters. The sensor will be fabricated using carbon fiber microelectrodes, and the data acquisition and analysis will be performed using fast scan cyclic voltammetry (FSCV). The outcome of this study will explain the fundamentals of this new sensor, thus, providing a greater mechanistic understanding of the system before testing in living systems. The broader impact of this project includes broadening women's participation in the STEM field and increasing public awareness of exposure to heavy metals and their negative impact on neurological disorders. These goals will be achieved through several outreach activities in collaboration with a local middle school.<br/><br/>This project aims to make fundamental contributions to developing an electrochemical sensing system to understand the role of heavy metals and co-transmitters in the brain. The outcome will provide missing information about the multifactorial etiology of neurodegenerative diseases to ultimately design more efficient drugs. As the initial step of a multi-step project, this work proposes to engineer new four-bore carbon fiber microelectrodes (CFMs) that simultaneously measure heavy metals and neurotransmitters using FSCV. The outcome will be achieved by (1) optimizing FSCV parameters to detect arsenic and cadmium at millisecond temporal resolution, the required speed to perform real-time, in vivo measurements, (2) fabricating a four-bore CFM, and (3) detecting heavy metals and several neurotransmitters simultaneously using the four-bore CFM. The rationale behind this proposed research is that, once the fundamentals of this new sensing platform are identified, it can be applied to in vivo measurements to probe neuronal communication in the presence of external stimuli such as heavy metals. This study will open new avenues to obtain critical, accurate speciation information about heavy metals and potential co-transmitter events, particularly in higher vertebrate animals with transformative applications in designing more effective therapeutics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Complementing these research efforts, this proposal introduces ""Ask a Scientist Gaming"" as a live streaming science outreach endeavor. Every other week, Professor Hanson hosts a different Ph.D. scientist to interface with the community and answer questions. The stream is free and available to individuals of all educational levels, socio-economic backgrounds, and identities. <br/><br/>Molecules undergo a structural change to minimize the energy of the high-energy state generated via external stimuli such as pressure, oxidants/reductants, magnetic fields, or light. This process is intrinsic to all molecules but large changes in structure, especially those of transition metal coordination complexes, can have a debilitating impact on their properties and subsequent use in catalysis, lighting, solar energy conversion, and more. The central hypothesis for this project is that strategic surface binding (i.e., coordinating multiple, independent ligands to a surface) inhibits stimuli-included reorganization, resulting in increased excited state lifetimes, electrochemical reversibility, and geometric ?trapping? of high energy species. Toward this end, the major goals of this work are to 1) synthesize a series of Cu(I) coordination complexes with systematic variation in the surface binding motif, 2) use spectroscopic and electrochemical techniques to determine the impact of surface binding on the molecules response to a stimulus, 3) geometrically trap coordinatively unsaturated and reactive Cu(I) photolysis products.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Bischak of the University of Utah is elucidating the relationship between electronic transport, ion motion, and structural dynamics in conjugated polymers that operate as organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs).  OMIECs are soft polymeric semiconductors which can conduct both electronic and ionic charges.  This unique ability makes them particularly suitable for a variety of applications of relevance to next-generation bioelectronic, optoelectronic and energy storage devices.  However, for many of these applications, it is currently difficult to choose a combination of polymer molecular structure, polymer processing conditions, and electrolyte to achieve a specific performance metric.  This project will fill these knowledge gaps by exploiting the high spatial resolution and chemical specificity of novel scanning probe imaging approaches, as well as a complementary suite of traditional and novel in situ techniques.  Fundamental correlations established as a result of this work have the potential to help guide synthetic chemists towards synthesizing the next generation of OMIEC conjugated polymers.  The interdisciplinary nature of this research will provide strong training and professional development opportunities for high school, undergraduate and graduate students.  The project will additionally support an outreach effort to supply local high school chemistry classrooms with affordable 3D-printed spectrometers to learn about light-matter interactions, similar to those that are used to interrogate OMIEC polymers.<br/><br/>This research will focus on investigating organic mixed ionic-electronic conductors (OMIECs) to uncover relationships between ion motion, electronic transport, and structural dynamics. Poly(thiophene)s with various backbones comprised of hydrocarbons, oligo (ethylene glycol)s, or carbonyl functionalities will be the focal points, in part because they are currently the highest performing OMIEC materials.  In the first specific aim, reversible and irreversible structural dynamics will be investigated using blends of semicrystalline and amorphous polymers to tune the crystallinity and measure ion injection kinetics as a function of crystalline to amorphous polymer ratios.  The second aim will extend studies to ion dependent effects.  Finally, the impacts of heterogeneous polymer structure will be addressed through correlative nanoscale imaging that will be used to answer basic questions about the doping process and structural dynamics.  The combined efforts have the potential to afford new insights into chemical design elements that enable more effective conductivity. This research aims to address critical knowledge gaps in the field with the goal of enabling design of optimal ionic and electronic conductivity in such systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main reason for this limitation is the incapability of the Zermelo-Fraenkel axiomatic system of set theory (ZFC), which is the global standard for the formal foundations of mathematics, to determine basic questions about the infinite. This channeled the research in modern set theory to mainly two directions. The first direction is the search for new restraints imposed by ZFC on the behavior of the infinite. This direction had great success in the realm of singular cardinal arithmetic where new surprising principles were discovered by Silver and later by Shelah. This project aims to study some of these principles. The second direction is the subtle interaction between extensions of ZFC to stronger axiomatic systems and statements which are unsettled by ZFC. Perhaps the most prominent axiomatic systems are extensions of ZFC by the so-called large cardinal axioms. This project contributes to the development of new constructions with large cardinals, implementing them to analyze the interaction between those large cardinal axioms and unsettled statements. The PI will lean of his extensive experiences of mentoring underprivileged students in his teaching activities.<br/><br/>This project deals with several central areas in set theory: (i) forcing theory and more particularly Prikry-type forcing; (ii) cardinal arithmetic; and (iii) infinitary combinatorics. Forcing with a Prikry-type forcing notion is perhaps the most important technique to generate models with non-trivial patterns of singular cardinal arithmetic. This project contributes to the investigation and sophistication of these techniques through several aspects: the development of combinatorics of ultrafilters, the discovery of new connections of this theory with other areas of set theory such as inner model theory and infinite combinatorics, the characterization of intermediate models of several Prikry-type models such as the Magidor-Radin model and the tree Prikry forcing, and obtaining stationary reflection at the successor of the first singulars of uncountable cofinalities. One particularly interesting combinatorial property of ultrafilters which is investigated in this project is the Galvin property which recently gained renewed interest due to the surprising connections of this property to the structure of ultrafilters in canonical inner models, the Tukey order, Prikry forcing, partition relations and more.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address this need, this project will prepare prospective STEM teachers to be grounded in rigorous STEM disciplinary practices alongside humanizing, culturally relevant, and justice-oriented teaching pedagogies. Features of the project for prospective STEM teachers include: 1) Financial support for highly motivated STEM majors to become STEM teachers, 2) Enhanced learning to teach STEM, field experiences, and communities of practice alongside practicing teachers; 3) Justice-oriented teacher professional career trajectory support; and 4) Beloved STEM educator community ? within Saint Mary?s, with local teachers, and with national and regional STEM and educational justice professional networks. The project team expects that STEM teachers from diverse backgrounds will not only enter the profession but persist as equity-oriented transformative urban school change agents.<br/><br/>This project at Saint Mary?s includes a partnership with Mt. Diablo Unified School District, a high-need local educational agency. Project goals include fostering scholars? growth along five knowledge bases: STEM content knowledge, knowledge of self: STEM teacher positionality, knowledge in solidarity with youth and communities, humanizing pedagogical knowledge, and knowledge of educational (in)justice and teachers as change agents. This project will provide financial support over five years (2023-2028) for 17 highly motivated students to complete a 4+1 consisting of a BA/BS in a STEM discipline (biology, biochemistry, chemistry, earth and environmental science, mathematics, or physics); a minor in Justice, Community, and Leadership; a secondary teaching credential; and Master?s in the Art of Teaching. This project will contribute to the field by generating new knowledge on the convergence of STEM disciplinary, secondary pedagogy, and justice studies as foundations for STEM teacher preparation. Insights gained about STEM teachers? trajectories through case study data and participant surveys could potentially lead to the identification of evidence-based strategies to improve STEM teacher preparation and retention in high-need schools. This project seeks to impact a) Saint Mary?s STEM teacher candidates by preparing them to enter STEM teaching grounded in STEM disciplinary, secondary pedagogy, and justice studies; b) STEM teachers and youth in Mt.

However, recent studies show that GNNs are vulnerable to graph perturbation attacks: slightly perturbing the graph structure can make GNN model's performance severely degraded. The lack of robustness of GNNs makes them risky for their potential applications. However, existing studies on GNN attacks and defenses are very limited in scope: the attacks are assumed under less practical scenarios (i.e., the attacker has a full or partial knowledge about the GNN model), while the defenses are either heuristic-based that can be easily broken or their robustness in defense is lacking. This project  aims to understand how to perform the graph perturbation attack to fool any GNNs with least/no knowledge about the GNN model. Accordingly, the project designs both restricted and stringent black-box graph perturbation attacks to any GNNs, which are inspired by the influence function and bandit algorithms, respectively. Next, the project aims to understand how to protect any GNNs from the strongest white-box attack with robustness guarantees. To this end, it designs provable defenses for any GNNs against white-box graph perturbation attacks via novel randomized smoothing techniques and designs principled methods to optimize the defense performance.<br/><br/>The project?s novelties are to gain a holistic understanding on the robustness of GNNs against graph perturbation attacks, to look into more practicable attacks and lastly to devise a more provable defenses. The project?s broader significance and impact are 1)advancing not only the field of secure and trustworthy machine learning, but also other fields (e.g., social science and economy) where graph data model and graph learning are widely used; 2) developing a new seminar course ?Graph Learning in the Adversarial Settings?, and 3)supporting cross-disciplinary research for both undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The use of an integrated STEM learning approach through robotics and mediated field experience will be studied and add important knowledge to the field of STEM education, along with the effectiveness of outreach and teacher preparation for rural, high-needs local education agencies. Outreach efforts to be employed to aid in recruitment of future STEM teachers include: 1)  K-12 student programming that provides STEM enrichment and vocational discernment opportunities; 2) collegiate student outreach regarding opportunities available in STEM education; 3) teacher networking opportunities including workshops, teacher circles, and professional learning communities. Cohort experiences designed to increase teacher preparation, quality, and retention will include: 1) the application of the mediated field experience model shown to improve teaching efficacy; 2) professional development opportunities including STEM education conferences; and 3) professional support during and after completion of a STEM-education bachelor?s degree through the DU Noyce Professional Learning Community.

The interfacial microlayer in such systems forms instantaneously at the interface yet continues to grow gradually, making it challenging to create a well-controlled thickness at the interface. The current award aims to address this challenge by investigating and understanding the underlying mechanisms that control interface growth and dynamics experimentally. The interdisciplinary nature of this award will provide opportunities to develop undergraduate and graduate curriculum, design educational outreach activities for the general public, and expose high school students with STEM subjects.<br/><br/>Stabilizing oil-water interfaces to create hierarchical functional structures between fluidic interfaces has been a significant area of study in various material sciences and engineering fields.

First, surfactants are inexpensive and commercially available; thus, no special and time-consuming synthesis is needed. Furthermore, no other ?all-liquid systems? can create meso-architectural morphologies, such as lamellar or hexagonal, except surfactant self-assembled systems. This award aims to investigate an aqueous surfactant system with oil cosurfactant to 1) identify spontaneous emulsification mechanism and control its kinetics rate; 2) control the microlayer growth and tune its viscoelasticity; 3) to integrate associative components to create reconfigurable interfaces, and 4) enhance the accessibility of STEM education for local underprivileged high school students.

Through mentoring and community building, the project will support students as they complete their associate?s and bachelor?s degrees and, after graduation, enter the teaching profession. Teacher preparation and induction will emphasize strong content and pedagogical knowledge and will target development of cultural competencies.

The first goal is to establish a cross-institutional team of faculty and staff members committed to recruiting undergraduate STEM majors and preparing them to become certified teachers. Second, over the five-year duration of the project, the investigators will recruit and provide financial and enhanced programmatic support to twenty (20) high-quality undergraduate STEM majors, of whom approximately 75% will be community college transfers, to prepare them to teach biology, chemistry, mathematics, or physics in high-need rural schools. Using a grow-your-own approach of recruiting students from their local areas and later placing them as STEM teachers in these same areas, the project will address critical teacher shortages in rural Southside and Southwest Virginia. Project support for teacher preparation and induction will include implementing high-impact practices such as enhanced faculty and peer mentoring, a summer bridge experience, cohort building, and a professional community of practice. For a third goal, the project will foster comprehensive, mixed methods formative and summative evaluation to: (1) provide assessment and feedback for adaptive project management and implementation and (2) generate evidence-based new knowledge for recruiting, supporting, preparing, and retaining community college and other students to become successful, culturally competent STEM teachers in high-need rural schools. In concert with this, the collaborative partnership will strengthen Longwood University's ongoing efforts to increase the number of students from traditionally marginalized groups in local schools who pursue careers in STEM fields.

This project uses eyewitness lineup identifications as a model paradigm.  One aim of the project uses AI to better understand verbal expressions of confidence about an identification.  For example, when an eyewitness states ?I?m pretty sure it?s him? about a lineup identification what is the likelihood that the eyewitness?s identification is correct? Another aim of the project examines how best to convey AI output to people so as to improve their predictions about the accuracy of an eyewitness?s identification.  <br/><br/>The project consists of two sets of experiments.  One set uses variations on an eyewitness memory paradigm to examine the predictive value of verbal (e.g., ?I?m pretty certain?) and numeric (e.g., ?I?m 75% certain?) expressions of confidence.  It is largely assumed that verbal confidence statements reflect the same underlying information as numeric confidence ratings.  Machine-learning classifiers are used to quantify verbal confidence to explain why verbal confidence is not redundant with numeric confidence but can contribute unique added value in predicting the accuracy of a response.  A second set of experiments test two predictions.  First, that machine learning estimates about the accuracy of a lineup identification are more resistant than human estimates to the effects of various kinds of contextual information.  Second, that a cognitive-forcing method of conveying machine-learning estimates about eyewitness identification accuracy is most effective at improving people?s predictions about eyewitness accuracy, particularly under conditions when people?s intuitions about eyewitness performance are wrong.

Satellite observations showed that the eruption introduced surprisingly little sulfur to the atmosphere but injected an enormous amount of water vapor into the stratosphere, about 10-20 miles above Earth?s surface. Water vapor is a greenhouse gas and is particularly effective at warming climate when it is in the stratosphere, where only trace amounts of water generally exist. The eruption increased the total global stratospheric water vapor content by roughly 10%, representing the largest single-source injection of stratospheric water vapor ever observed from space, and furthermore this excess water could persist for 5-10 years. The Tonga eruption therefore represents an unprecedented natural experiment on Earth?s atmosphere. This investigation will use observations and modeling to assess the atmospheric impacts of the eruption, including its effects on Earth?s energy budget via alterations to the amount of sunlight and infrared energy absorbed and emitted by the planet. The investigators will assess how the eruption affected stratospheric temperatures, circulation patterns throughout the atmosphere, and the annual ozone hole formation over Antarctica, which may be perturbed through chemical and physical mechanisms related to the eruption. More broadly, this project will evaluate how well an Earth System Model captures the observed perturbations to Earth?s atmosphere in the years following the eruption and identify improvements to models that remedy any deficiencies that are found.<br/><br/>In a broader sense, this project will contribute to an improved understanding of the atmospheric and climate impacts and risks to global society posed by large volcanic eruptions, particularly those that erupt beneath the ocean surface like the 2022 Tonga event. Records of past volcanic activity recorded in ice cores from Greenland and Antarctica indicate that eruptions ten times more powerful than the 2022 Tonga event occur roughly once every 625 years, with potentially severe impacts on civilization. The scientists involved in this project will conduct simulations of such events to explore their potential impacts. They will also adapt an Earth System Model so that it can be used more readily by the scientific community to comprehensively study climate impacts from volcanic eruptions, for example by improving the ability of the model to track and isolate the influences of volcanic water vapor, sulfur, and ash.  Finally, the investigators will train and mentor a Ph.D. student for this project and expand the material on volcano-climate interactions presented in the graduate- and undergraduate-level courses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfair outcomes in ML systems result from historical biases in the data used to train them. A learning algorithm designed merely to minimize prediction error may inherit or even exacerbate such biases; particularly when observed attributes of individuals, critical for generating accurate decisions, are biased by their group identities (e.g., race or gender) due to existing social and cultural inequalities. Understanding and measuring these biases-- at the data level-- is a challenging yet crucial problem, leading to constructive insights and methodologies for debiasing the data and adapting the learning system to minimize discrimination, as well as raising the need for policy changes and infrastructural development. This project aims to establish a comprehensive framework for precisely quantifying the marginal impact of individuals? attributes on accuracy and unfairness of decisions, using tools from information and game theories and causal inference, along with legal and social science definitions of fairness. This multi-disciplinary effort will provide guidelines and design insights for practitioners in the field of fair data-driven automated systems and inform the public debate on social consequences of artificial intelligence.<br/><br/>The majority of previous work formulates the algorithmic fairness problem from the viewpoint of the learning algorithm by enforcing a statistical or counterfactual fairness constraint on the learner?s outcome and designing a learner that meets it. As the considered fairness problem originates from biased data, merely adding constraints to the prediction task might not provide a holistic view of its fundamental limitations. This project looks at the fairness problem through different lens, where instead of asking ?for a given learner, how can we achieve fairness??, it asks ?for a given dataset, what are the inherent tradeoffs in the data, and based on these, what is the best learner we can design??. In supervised learning models, the challenge in the proposed problem lies in the complex structures of correlation/causation among individuals? attributes (covariates), their group identities (protected features), the target variable (label), and the prediction outcome (decision). In analyzing the dataset, the marginal impacts of covariates on the accuracy and discrimination of decisions are quantified from the data, via carefully designed measures accounting for the complex correlation/causation structures among variables and the inherent tension between accuracy and fairness objectives. Subsequently, methods to exploit the quantified impacts in guiding downstream ML systems to improve their achievable accuracy-fairness tradeoff will be investigated. Importantly, the proposed framework provides explainable solutions, where the inclusion of certain attributes in the learning system is explained by their importance for accurate as well as fair decisions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polymers have been of critical importance over the past century for the production of consumer goods, manufacturing systems, transportation, construction, and medical products, among others. These lightweight soft materials are produced with chemicals known as monomers that react to form extremely large molecules (macromolecules) that have posed challenges in sustainability such as the widely known problem of plastic pollution. Over the past few decades, the opportunity has emerged to create new materials known as ?supramolecular polymers? in which monomers do not react to form macromolecules but instead are designed to strongly interact and emulate properties of traditional polymers. These structures tend not to be as mechanically robust as traditional polymers but could facilitate recycling and biodegradation, and also generate materials for advanced applications in energy, electronics, and medicine. This project investigates strategies to develop new materials termed ?hybrid bonding polymers? which integrate traditional and supramolecular polymers to create sustainable systems that have suitable mechanical properties and potential for new technologies. The project will train undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students--including those from underrepresented groups--in highly interdisciplinary research needed for future technical challenges at the interface of synthetic organic chemistry, polymer chemistry, and materials science. Researchers supported by the grant will be encouraged to participate in science outreach programs for K-12 students in the Chicago area.<br/><br/><br/>PART 2: TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/> <br/>The integration of macromolecules and supramolecular polymers in which covalent and noncovalent bonds are rationally integrated has great potential as a key innovation in soft materials. In these ?hybrid bonding polymers?, small molecules forming supramolecular domains could be co-crystallized with covalent polymers functionalized with the same molecules. This can generate functional structures in which polymer backbones with mechanical benefits are covalently connected to sites of crystalline lattices. Hybrid bonding could also generate more sustainable structures than fully covalent polymers in which high value-added small molecules can be easily recycled. The proposed work will develop and investigate these unique structures, their self-assembly mechanisms, and also the properties of experimental materials. Specifically, systems to be investigated will include crystallizable chromophores such as electron donors and acceptors as well as photosensitizers targeting properties such as photocatalysis, ferroelectricity, and supramolecular chirality. It is envisioned that potential applications could include light harvesting materials for photocatalytic solar fuel production, energy-efficient data storage, and sensing, among others. Beyond the potential technological impact, the studies proposed here will provide valuable cross disciplinary training to undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral students from both chemistry and materials science and engineering programs. The cohort of students will include members of underrepresented groups who will receive ample support from the PI and other members of the laboratory. Additionally, students and postdoctoral fellows working on this project will be encouraged to participate in K-12 science outreach programs that are available through the University. <br/>.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Unfortunately, during this process, engineers often make code changes that increase software defects, unintended system behavior, and code deterioration. Low-quality code changes have significant consequences for end-users, organizations, and society, as they create excessive costs in software development, operation, and maintenance. In fact, in 2020, the estimated cost of low-quality software in the United States was two trillion dollars. A crucial cause for low-quality code changes is the fact that software engineers often have insufficient knowledge about the code, which leads them to make poor decisions on how to correctly change it. Obtaining such knowledge is extremely challenging, in part because documented code-related information is unstructured, fragmented, and scattered across various software artifacts/repositories without explicit traceability relationships among them.  To address these fundamental challenges, this project will process and manage code change decisions documented in software artifacts/repositories to assist engineers in making informed decisions on how to correctly change source code. The premise that guides this project, supported by prior research results, is that documented code change decisions contain valuable code-related knowledge that can inform software engineers in designing and implementing code changes that meet software requirements and minimize the introduction of defects, unintended system behavior, and code deterioration. This project will produce a novel theory of decision-making for code change, as well as novel techniques and interactive/integrated tool support to better capture, trace, and recommend code change decision information, useful to design and implement high-quality code changes. The results of this project will allow software engineers to easily capture and manage their decisions in software artifacts while they are solving new feature/enhancement requests and defect reports. Additionally, engineers will better learn from prior decisions to produce software that is less faulty and easier to maintain. Organizations and society will benefit from software systems that support their business processes more effectively, leading to lower costs in software development, operation, and maintenance.<br/> <br/>This project is centered on three goals. First, it will develop a theory of code change decisions that will document: (i) strategies and patterns of code change decision-making, (ii) factors that make adequate and poor code change decisions, and (iii) actionable guidelines on how software engineers should make/reuse code change decisions to solve new problems. Second, it will design and develop novel automated techniques and interactive tool support for capturing and tracing information elements of code change decisions, while engineers document code-related knowledge in various software artifacts. Third, it will design and develop novel automated techniques and interactive tool support to inform engineers about: (i) the reasons why past code changes were made, (ii) past code change decisions relevant to solve a new feature/enhance request or defect report, and (iii) evidence of the impact that past decisions had on code quality and defect introduction. The proposed theory and techniques will be developed through cross-cutting research on empirical software engineering, automated text analysis, machine/deep learning, information retrieval, and human-computer interaction. The project aims to educate the next generation of software engineers with a strong foundation and skills to build and evolve high-quality software. Students at all scholarly levels will learn about code change decisions and the way these can be used to effectively build and maintain software. The project will create reusable educational course packages, integrate research tools into course projects, organize community-building and outreach events, and recruit/retain students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In at least some cases, these sizes appear to be specified with fairly high precision.  For example, organs from human limbs to fruit fly wings exhibit size asymmetry between the left and right organ in the same animal of about 1%, and in appropriate conditions the coefficient of variation of bacterial length at division is around 10%.  Very little is known about where these numbers come from.  What sorts of noise or variability inside the living organism ultimately contribute the most to size errors?  Is a 1% difference in wing sizes surprisingly good, close to the limits of what is possible given basic laws of physics, or would it be easy to imagine how the difference could be made even smaller?  This project with use methods from the physical sciences to develop the basic theoretical framework needed to answer questions like these.  The investigators will further collaborate with experimental labs to refine their ideas and apply them to specific living systems.<br/><br/>The project will also give students at all levels an opportunity to pursue research in an interdisciplinary team; in particular, the principal investigator will work with the University of Michigan?s M-STEM Academies to recruit a diverse group of undergraduate students to the project team.

A unifying question is how noise and fluctuations affect growth and limit the precision with which a given final size can be reached.  The investigators will explore these issues at multiple scales and in multiple model systems.  In particular, they will:  (1) Examine lumped, space-free models of stochastic growth and growth arrest, with applications to (A) size distributions of cells and organs; (B) size coordination between contralateral wings in the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster; and (C) size coordination between contralateral somites during zebrafish somitogenesis.  Formally, these models will initially take the form of first passage problems in two variables, an actual and an estimated size.  Extensions will include allowing for the presence of various forms of correlated and non-white noise.  (2) Study cell-based models of spatially resolved growth in tissues.  Goals here will be to determine how correlations in cell size across tissues can be used to draw inferences about mechanisms of tissue size regulation and to understand what limits the uniformity of cell size in cohesive tissues.  In particular, the investigators will compare and contrast models in which growth and proliferation arrest occur simultaneously with models where cell size adjustment and correction occurs after division has ceased.  Theoretical predictions will be compared to observations in Drosophila wings and dorsal pupal notum.<br/><br/>This project will integrate education with interdisciplinary research while supporting a diverse student body, enriching classroom instruction, and reinforcing efforts to sustain a cohesive quantitative biology community at the University of Michigan. It will give students at all levels an opportunity to pursue research in a team where they will work closely with colleagues from both the biological and the physical sciences and will support international research experiences for one graduate student.  The principal investigator will work with the University of Michigan?s M-STEM Academy to involve a diverse group of undergraduates in research early in their college careers; such involvement has been shown to improve retention of students from historically under-represented groups in science and engineering fields.  The project further supports the continued development of studio exercises incorporating biologically relevant examples for the introductory physics course sequence for life sciences majors and the principal investigator?s work in organizing an interdisciplinary quantitative biology seminar and journal club series at the University of Michigan.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are increasingly used nowadays, including IoT (Internet of Things) devices (e.g., smart home devices) and embedded devices (e.g., Bluetooth/Wi-Fi modules in the desktop/mobile platform). However, the advantage comes with the expense of no or limited software and hardware protections. As a result, new vulnerabilities are being discovered in resource-constrained systems. To mitigate this problem, Rust is gaining popularity in implementing these systems due to its safety and close performance to C/C++, while a Rust compiler enforces restrictive rules and leverages the unsafe keyword to bypass them. Unfortunately, the introduction of unsafe Rust code also introduces potential safety issues defeating the purpose of using Rust to enhance resource-constrained systems. This project addresses this challenge by exploring, designing and experimenting with various tools and frameworks in the context of resource-constrained systems, and provides insights on unsafe Rust code in these systems. In this way, this project targets reducing the negative effect of using the unsafe keyword and support developers with more confidence in safety guarantee. <br/><br/>This project aims to improve using Rust in resource-constrained systems by eliminating unnecessary usage of the unsafe keyword or preventing the potential issues caused by unsafe Rust code. As a result, resource-constrained systems written in Rust would be more secure, even if the unsafe keyword is used. Furthermore, tools and frameworks developed in this project will be open-source. They will not only be helpful to resource-constrained system developers, but also contribute to the Rust community. The best practices concluded and lessons learned during this project will also be open to the community. The goal is to elaborate the result as RFC (Request for Comments) documents and make them the standard.

This project seeks to understand how people assign value in these types of transactions (wages, homebuying), focusing on how individuals respond to competition and market changes. The project team is partnering with financial education programs on money management and first-time homebuyers to understand how differences between people ? such as their tolerance for risks or willingness to delay purchases until a future date ? predict their success on job and housing markets. The findings will allow us to better understand the psychology of value, create educational resources to help people adopt better strategies for finding jobs or housing, and identify public policy interventions that can alleviate housing and labor shortages.<br/><br/>Across a series of experiments, this project tests computational models of pricing in multi-alternative, multi-attribute settings. These experiments manipulate simulated market competitiveness, delays, risks, and attributes of the choice alternatives in order to examine the dynamics of price-setting among individuals and test the cognitive mechanisms of pricing models. To improve the accessibility and efficiency of pricing model fitting and comparison, the project embeds them in neural networks trained to map observed pricing data onto generative model parameters. These will be added to online tools, teaching materials, and workshops to make them widely available. The pricing models will be used to estimate risk and delay aversion, bias, and pricing dynamics in multi-alternative choice experiments. The model parameters will also be used to predict the outcomes of job and home searches among participants in financial education programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Helium is a non-renewable resource, and the scientific instrumentation that relies on liquid helium (LHe) is linked to the status of the global helium supply. As a result of helium shortages, critical scientific infrastructure is in jeopardy, which puts the US researchers who rely on that infrastructure at risk of losing their competitiveness. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometers require a constant supply of helium because of the superconducting coils that generate the high magnetic fields needed for those instruments. This makes NMR facilities acutely susceptible to fluctuations in the helium market. With a helium recovery system, the MSU NMR Facility will recycle nearly all of the helium it uses, assuring its continued viability and allowing it to serve new users by maintaining low user fees. The team is also developing a teaching unit on helium recycling and scarcity for MSU?s popular Environmental Chemistry class. Information on the installation process will be disseminated via the NMR facility?s website and YouTube channel. This will support the installation of helium recovery systems in other small NMR facilities like that at MSU. <br/><br/>The proposed helium recovery equipment will support NMR equipment serving numerous chemistry and biology research projects throughout the region. Examples include synthesis of organometallic and inorganic chemicals used in novel catalysts, C-H activation, CO2 reduction, photocatalysis, and organic light-emitting diodes (OLEDs). The facility will also support research on biomolecular function, multifunctional materials, and novel polymers.

Archaeology, able to trace urban adaptations over the course of centuries and even millennia, is uniquely well placed to provide relevant insights. This project assesses whether human and animal mobility and migration are necessary elements of durable urbanism, particularly in fragile and ecologically dynamic settings. Focusing on a region where large cities persisted for millennia in environments characterized by dramatic shifts in water availability and soils highly vulnerable to salinization, the research team tests whether early cities relied on immigration to sustain their populations and on long-distance pastoralism to support their economies. Throughout the research, student training and engagement with diverse publics in multiple countries advances public scientific literacy and global STEM education, maximizing the practical as well as ethical value of archaeological research.<br/><br/>In order to determine whether mobility and migration are required elements of urban success, an international team examines the geographical origins and mobility of human and animal populations associated with durable urban settlement on a premodern floodplain. Isotopic analyses of skeletal remains enable scientists to trace ancient organisms? mobility and migration in regions where baseline maps of isotope values are available. The research team creates the first strontium, neodymium, and lead isotope map of the region generating an open-access tool that establishes a foundation for ongoing and future isotope research in the region. The team uses this map to determine whether isotope values in remains recovered from one ancient city are consistent with urban reliance on immigration and specialized mobile pastoralism. The project thus (a) supports regional multidisciplinary isotope research, (b) determines whether premodern urban adaptations inherently encompass significant levels of mobility and migration, and (c) creates scientific training opportunities while enhancing global STEM engagement.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of all the different kinds of exploitable software weaknesses, memory errors -- i.e., bugs that can be (ab)used by attackers, via crafty inputs, to corrupt or leak memory contents -- have been particularly pernicious to deal with. Developers and security engineers are unable to keep up with the sheer number of security errors (e.g., memory errors)  being exploited that need patching.  The focus of this project is on adapting software defenses to the specific deployment environment, as that environment changes due to new functionality and new threats.  The project will produce open source prototypes of tools to automate the adaptation of defenses, thereby increasing the effectiveness of the defenses while radically reducing the human effort involved in defending against new threats as they arise.  The objective is to enable more effective, sophisticated defenses by automating the customization of defenses to fit the deployment environments.   The resulting techniques and tools will contribute to the next-generation security architecture that enables software defenses to be constantly in flux to provide robust software protection mechanisms.  <br/><br/>The project consists of three synergistic thrusts under the umbrella of adaptive security: adaptive hardening, hardware-assisted adaptive protection and adaptive debloating.  The project will investigate techniques to enable software systems to dynamically adapt their defenses and functionality along several dimensions. Techniques for binary rewriting and program hardening will be enhanced to support adaptability.  Adaptive hardening will equip binaries with rich metadata including call graphs and types. Static binary rewriting performs install-time, load-time, and runtime adaptations. Hardware-assisted adaptive hardening uses hardware features such as Intel's CET for adaptive hardening; Finally, unused code is removed by automating debloating. There are several benefits of an adaptive approach to software security. First, the capability to be agile in software hardening creates a diversified and unpredictable environment, which hinders the ability of adversaries to use canned recipes to bypass exploit mitigations. Second, hardening rectification allows software to make the best use of the hardening capabilities that a particular setting offers, while dynamically adapting the deployed defenses to meet changing needs.

Prolonged stay increases patients? risk of hospital-acquired infections and disrupts patient flow and access to high-quality healthcare services. As such, a model that can reliably predict the length of stay for a specific patient is desirable to mitigate the prolonged stay and guide personalized decision-making. However, the length of stay can be affected by a multitude of factors and can vary based on different patients? conditions and disease progression. The complex and dynamic nature of massive clinical data, not to mention the presence of a large portion of missing and censored values in the healthcare data, poses significant challenges for efficient modeling and dynamic prediction. This project aims to offer an integrated solution by establishing a pipeline consisting of advanced statistical modeling, monitoring, and deep learning techniques based on patient information collected from heterogeneous medical systems over time. The success of the project will catalyze a transition from a traditional standard-driven discharge scheduling service to a data-driven proactive scheduling paradigm. The success of the project will alleviate the hospital?s pressure on resource allocation and improve patient flow and, more importantly, pandemic preparedness. The project can provide opportunities for research-based interdisciplinary training of undergraduate and graduate students in health informatics, statistics, and artificial intelligence from diverse backgrounds, including women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/><br/>This project will address the critical challenges of healthcare data analysis, i.e., heterogeneity, multi-modality, and data sparsity. Conventional data-driven methods have been predominantly focused on identifying the factors that strongly influence the length of stay as opposed to predicting the length of stay itself. Moreover, the existing approaches failed to address the inherent uncertainty and were incapable of incorporating different data modalities and dynamic prediction. The project proposes a personalized framework by integration of advanced tensor fusion and time-to-event modeling techniques towards smart patient flow management, which ultimately allows for faster achievement of health outcomes and reduction of hospitalized costs. The proposed intelligent framework will advance the state-of-art research of real-time data fusion and personalized prognosis in the following aspects: (1) brings the data fusion and length of stay prediction into a unified framework; (2) facilitates personalized length of stay prediction in a real-time manner; (3) naturally has the capability to incorporate uncertainties in the decision-making process to provide a confident and intelligent scheduling service. Although the methodology is proposed for the patient length of stay prediction, it does not depend on any restrictive assumptions of domain knowledge and specific disease and thus can potentially be applied to a broad range of events predictions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To this regard, the proposal treats sparsity as a key primitive to reduce the requirement on the computational and memory resources without sacrificing the accuracy of the models. It seeks to investigate the fundamental understanding of the sparsity in both the data and model at the system-level using graph as a data-model. The preliminary study gathered a few system-level requirements and show that blindly adopting the best practices of sparse linear algebra and graph analytics systems fields, both of which are unrelated to deep learning, lead to many new system-level overheads for deep learning computation. The research proposal will lay down a better sparse data representation to improve the data locality, and will develop theory and systems to solve the workload imbalance problem in the computation involving sparse data and models. The proposal will result in reduction of memory consumption and will achieve faster computation. Both the goals of the proposal will also enable resource-constrained devices to be a part of the deep learning computation ecosystem.<br/><br/>Deep learning has enabled use-cases that are being used for diverse societal goals including in the fields of medical science, defense, financial fraud detection, etc. By enabling such use-cases of more diverse datasets and models, both sparse, the proposal seeks to create better impact on the society by achieving faster computation at reduced memory usage, resulting in reduced cost for training and deployment of various deep learning models. The more immediate impact will be in the educational activities in the form of incorporating the developed learning tool(s) for classroom teaching, student projects, outreach to under-represented, minority and female students. Due to the strong interest from the industry in this field, students will be exposed to industry standard tools, as well get trained on end-to-end deep learning systems and data science both-- a key industry requirement that was also identified by the industry partners in an NSF Workshop.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The current technology of manufacturing responsive microstructures faces significant challenges due to the cost of expensive tools, such as high-resolution 3D printers, and limitation in the diversity of target 3D shapes. This award will investigate the potential of an inexpensive alternative manufacturing method based on self-assembly process. In a self-assembly process, the small building blocks of a material organize themselves into a functional structure without human intervention. By using responsive building blocks, the shape of a self-assembled structure can be reconfigured on demand. Because self-assembly provides access to the material response at a building-block level and the flexibility to assemble and disassemble on demand, it is a promising candidate for solving the engineering challenges of responsive material design at small scales. This award will provide opportunities to train undergraduate and Masters? students at CSUF (a Hispanic-serving Institution) into highly skilled researchers and future leaders of engineering research. It will also engage the broader community in cutting-edge soft materials research. <br/> <br/>Colloidal particles that change their shape in response to light will be employed to investigate responsive self-assembly, with a focus on shaping the global structure using local tuning of particle shapes. A new experimental system will be developed that allows for static and dynamic patterned light illumination on colloidal assemblies. The specific goals of this award are (1) to test the hypothesis that ordered colloidal crystals can be shaped through emission and migration of dislocations, and (2) to investigate shapeshifting of disordered colloidal clusters. In addition, a numerical model will be developed to understand the impact of colloidal interaction range and strength on the shapeshifting dynamics. To date, experiments on responsive self-assembly have been studied only in the context of global shape reconfiguration. This award will allow testing of theoretical predictions suggesting that control over local particle shapes will lead to intriguing global behavior with applications in defect engineering, colloidal robotics, and the study of active matter.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project aims at describing these behaviors for complex random dynamical systems used to model phenomena in physics: random growth models, front propagation, fluid dynamics models, polymer chains interacting with disordered environments. For noisy systems with multiple stationary regimes such as nonlinear reaction networks, the project aims at studying patterns of random switching between those regimes.

In addition to human emissions methane has many natural sources to the atmosphere, which could be amplified by future climate warming. Methane emissions from the vast open ocean are relatively small but their sensitivity to climate change is highly uncertain. This is because the processes that supply methane to surface ocean waters are not well understood. To improve our understanding of the open ocean methane cycle, this project will use a computer model to interpret a large database of methane concentration measurements. First, the model will be used to determine the dominant biological source of methane within surface waters. Candidates include production during algae growth, production in the guts of small animals, and bacterial decay of organic matter. Each of these processes would produce a different surface methane pattern, allowing the model to distinguish between them. Second, the model will quantify the supply of methane from the seafloor in low oxygen zones of the ocean, and determine whether this methane is consumed by bacteria before escaping to the atmosphere. This is important because low oxygen zones will likely grow as the climate warms. Leakage of methane from these regions could therefore act as a feedback on climate change. <br/><br/>The global model developed in this project will simulate the open ocean sources and sinks of methane, including in situ aerobic methanogenesis in surface waters, diffusion from anoxic sediments, oxidation in the water column, and exchange with the atmosphere. Data will be assimilated to optimize model parameters, and ultimately determine the balance of sources and sinks that is most consistent with the observed ocean methane distribution. Aerobic methane production will be formulated as function of phytoplankton growth, zooplankton abundance, and organic matter recycling, to determine which mechanisms best explains the pattern of surface methane supersaturation. The oxygen dependence of sedimentary methane sources and bacterial methane oxidation will be optimized to best match the observed plumes that spread laterally from suboxic waters and upwell towards the surface. The resulting optimized model will then be used to predict future perturbation of the open ocean methane source in response to ecosystem changes and ocean oxygen loss.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Individuals and households potentially respond to a wide range of variables that can promote conservation-oriented behavior, including financial incentives and social, cultural, political, and institutional factors. Within a population, individuals may exhibit additional variation related to personalities, values, identities, and social norms. This research focuses on how these factors interact with material rewards to shape the willingness of individuals and households to accept payments for environmental conservation, an approach that is commonly employed in cost-share programs in the United States and other countries. This study helps researchers to understand how people perceive such payments and who enrolls in such programs, information that can inform the design and effective implementation of these programs to be more inclusive and effective at promoting environmental conservation. This project also contributes to improving research methods used by cultural anthropologists and researchers in other disciplines by combining in-depth interviews with a large-scale experiment. The organization of an open workshop allows the researchers to promote the methodological approach among social scientists and other audiences, including students.<br/><br/>This research aims to explore why individuals who have been offered material incentives to promote environmental conservation, either conditional upon their adoption of specific behaviors or unconditionally, may be equally likely to participate in the program. Among environmental social scientists, unconditional incentives have conventionally been expected to be more appealing, particularly to marginalized populations, including women and poorer households, who commonly face higher barriers to participation and more difficulties to meet program conditions. In contrast to those expectations, however, prior research has shown that the conditionality of compensation may not be predictive of participation in programs. This project uses ethnographic methods and cultural consensus analysis to assess the mechanisms behind this unexpected finding from a previous study, which employed a randomized controlled trial. Alongside consideration of multiple hypotheses from diverse academic disciplines, this project also examines a new hypothesis that cultural norms about trust, intrinsic motivation, and perceptions of fairness play a more prominent role in households? decisions to participate in conservation programs than the conditionality of the programs? payments. The ethnographic work that is being conducted as part of this project helps to contextualize the prior findings and advance theory in the interdisciplinary study of conservation behavior.

The team will partner with the San Joaquin County Office of Education in California and the Maryland Center for Computing Education and work closely with two school districts, one in CA and one in MD, that serve student populations underrepresented and underserved in the field of AI. <br/><br/>Researchers will address three research questions: 1) How do students? social and disciplinary identities shape their participation in learning of AI knowledge and AI-rich careers? Guided by the intersectional identity theory, the project will capture eight focal students? learning processes with repeated interviews, video, audio, and screencast recordings, and computer logs. These data will be analyzed using the personal narratives framework and ethnomethodological and conversation-analytic approaches. 2) What and how are new ideas generated by teachers as they seek to coordinate their efforts to integrate AI across the curriculum? Based on the community of practice theory, the project will capture teachers? idea generation and transaction processes with Professional Development (PD) recordings, online communications, and interviews. These data will be analyzed using the idea authorship framework. 3) To what extent, for whom, and under what conditions does the AI Across the Curriculum program support students to develop knowledge of and interest in AI-rich careers? The demographic and academic backgrounds of 900 students and 12 teachers will be collected via surveys to determine the impact of this approach. An AI & Machine Learning Core Concepts Questionnaire and an AI-Rich Careers Questionnaire will be administered before and after the curriculum. These data will be analyzed quantitatively to determine to what extent, for whom, and under what conditions the modules are beneficial. Through research publications and professional learning resources, the project will increase the capacity of educators and researchers to advance AI education. All technologies, curriculum modules, assessments, and PD materials will be freely available to the public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This creates a critical gap between reliability observed in laboratory settings and the performance expected in the real world, where future attacks are unknown. This project fills this gap and builds an effective symbiosis between Artificial Intelligence (AI) and humans. The project novelties are new methods that (a) allow the AI to effectively learn from humans how to increase detectability of unknown attacks on biometric systems, and (b) support humans in their examination of fake biometric inputs. The project's broader significance and importance are: (a) trustworthy biometric systems that better recognize never-seen presentation attacks, and thus better protect consumer devices, bank accounts and strengthen the US border control processes; (b) a strong educational program that exposes K-12, undergraduate and graduate students to both the security- and ethics-related aspects of biometrics, and broadens their knowledge in a relevant topic of national concern;  (c) publicly available lectures prepared by the investigator, which will broaden the awareness of responsible use of biometrics.<br/><br/>In this project, a holistic framework for human-machine supervision cycle will be established to enable (a) human-guided design of computer vision methods to make the biometric presentation attack detection mechanisms generalize better to unknown attack instruments and (b) creation of computer-aided methods of assisting human examiners in detecting of fake inputs. Fundamental   technical contributions of this project include (1) broadening knowledge about mechanisms that govern human perception of fake visual signals, (2) discovering the most effective human-interpretable representations of information to support their decisions and speed up their learning of new types of attacks, (3) developing quantitative metrics of trust assessment and linking human and machine decisions into a trustworthy tandem that makes better judgements on the authenticity of biometric inputs, and (4) application of the framework to iris recognition of newborns, contributing to a better linkage with mothers and/or guardians, resulting in improved chances to benefit from healthcare systems, especially in developing countries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the focal points will be the non-linear Fourier transform (NLFT), closely related to scattering transform for the Dirac system of differential equations. The Dirac system is the quantum electrodynamical law governing spin  particles and should be thought of as a relativistic generalization of the Schrdinger equation. Better understanding of NLFT can lead to progress in several areas of mathematical analysis and non-linear differential equations. Questions of convergence and maximal estimates for NLFT will be studied. These are considered by the experts to be among the main problems of non-linear harmonic analysis. The second part will concern extensions and generalizations of classical results of spectral theory, which can be obtained via a new approach developed recently based on the use of so-called Toeplitz operators. Some related questions will be investigated jointly with graduate students. The materials of the project will be used in minicourses and a special topics course aiming at junior researchers and graduate students.<br/><br/>A large part of this project concerns problems of convergence of the scattering data for a Dirac system of differential equations. Scattering is commonly viewed as a non-linear version of the classical Fourier transform, which connects this project to the maximal estimates for NLFT. These connections lead to natural questions of establishing versions of the classical results of Fourier analysis in the non-linear settings of scattering. They have been appearing in various forms for most of the last century and remain an object of active research today. As an example, one can look at the non-linear version of Parseval's identity, which can be traced as far back as the work of Verblunski in the 1930s, and a non-linear analog of Hausdorff-Young inequality, which appears in more recent work of Christ and Kiselev. Several of such questions will be studied, as well as ones in the areas of inverse spectral theory and completeness in various spaces of analytic functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematical optimization offers a powerful and flexible tool to formulate and solve decision-making problems, with numerous applications in engineering, computer science, and operations research. However, applying optimization to real-time decision-making has always been limited by two fundamental challenges: ensuring robustness to uncertain problem parameters (e.g., energy demand, obstacle positions); and ensuring real-time algorithm convergence on embedded platforms with limited computational resources (e.g., embedded microcontrollers). This project seeks to address these challenges using machine learning to develop the next-generation real-time optimization tools to safely control cyber-physical systems. These results will lead to open-source software for embedded optimization, which will ease their application in a wide range of engineering disciplines (e.g., energy, transportation, and autonomous systems) where real-time optimization is considered too computationally expensive and unreliable.<br/> <br/>The research outcomes of this project will be integrated into a synergistic education plan to train future engineers by promoting optimization and computational thinking. These initiatives include the development of new learning units for undergraduate and graduate core courses in optimization; a new biennial workshop for graduate students on learning, decision, and control; and a new student-created podcast.<br/><br/>To achieve these results, we will exploit the repetitive nature of real-time decision-making. In practical scenarios, we solve the same optimization problem repeatedly with different data. For example, control systems update the input actions as sensor signals (e.g., system state) and goals (e.g., desired trajectory) vary. The key insight of this project is to exploit this structure to develop specialized data-driven optimization tools that are reliable and efficient. (i) We will learn data-driven problem formulations with constraint satisfaction guarantees for decision-making under uncertainty. (ii) We will develop data-driven tools to design and numerically verify real-time optimization algorithms, with tight convergence guarantees. The embedded optimization techniques developed in this research will be validated through extensive real-world experiments on real-time embedded platforms for space exploration and unmanned aerial vehicles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These models come in various forms, such as neural network models for image and speech recognition, mixture models for text classification, and graphical models for studying the interaction between genes. But the increasing volume and complexity of the data make it infeasible to perform exact calculations with such models. A viable alternative used ubiquitously in data science is sampling, which can generate approximate, randomized, and computationally efficient solutions. For example, given a data set of thousands of genes, by generating random gene networks repeatedly according to some sampling scheme, one can determine which network best explains the observed data and quantify the probabilities of gene interactions. However, the performance of sampling methods can vary significantly across different problems and is often hard to analyze theoretically. In this project, a paradigm-shifting sampling methodology with theoretical guarantees will be developed. The methods developed are widely applicable and are particularly useful when a large number of good solutions to the problem exist, but only a few can be identified by traditional sampling algorithms. The research team will implement the methods for solving computationally intensive problems in genomics, such as heritability estimation of complex traits, and for studying the water use efficiency of different cotton varieties. The latter will help agronomists develop and select high-yielding cotton varieties with better drought tolerance. The research includes projects suitable for training graduate students and open-source software development.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop new algorithms for sampling from multimodal target distributions, a universal computational challenge in statistics, machine learning, and applied sciences. A novel approach to devising Markov chain Monte Carlo methods will be developed, which bridges existing sampling techniques, including random walk Metropolis-Hastings algorithms, importance sampling, and simulated tempering. This new paradigm enables researchers to combine different techniques conveniently, leading to both theoretical and methodological advancements that are impossible in the classical framework. Particularly, the research team will develop new algorithms that involve multiple chains, with each chain?s behavior and computational cost optimized according to whether it is used for exploration or exploitation. Convergence analysis will be conducted under general multimodal settings to provide theoretical guarantees. One application of the proposed sampling methodology that will be researched in depth is the learning of partial differential equation models. A novel Bayesian methodology based on Gaussian processes will be developed for inferring unknown parameters in highly non-linear partial differential equation models, which can be seamlessly integrated with the proposed sampling methods. Other applications, including high-dimensional model selection problems, will also be studied, and algorithms tailored to each problem will be developed. All resulting software packages will be made publicly available. Ultimately, the statistical methodology and algorithms developed in this project will be utilized to tackle pressing problems in genomics and crop sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chaotic behavior in dynamical systems is characterized by sensitive dependence on initial conditions, which occurs when small changes in a system?s present state may produce large fluctuations in its future state.  This occurs in many natural systems, such as the human heart, fluid flows, and global weather patterns.  The PI plans to develop a general framework and new approaches for understanding chaotic behavior in a large class of dynamical systems.  Activities in the project will lead to progress in our understanding of fundamental dynamical phenomena, with possible consequences and applications in other mathematical fields, such as geometry and number theory, and other scientific areas, such as physics and economics. The project will also involve the training of several students and postdocs. <br/> <br/>This project is part of a program of research studying ergodic and statistical properties of smooth systems on manifolds and their interactions with geometry and number theory, with three main areas of focus. One area concerns some classical properties that are expected to hold for chaotic systems: K and Bernoulli properties, quantitative mixing (and higher order mixing) and limit theorems. The PI will investigate relations between these properties and their appearance for partially hyperbolic (or non-uniformly partially hyperbolic) systems, and continue developing a geometric framework for problems related to quantitative mixing and the Bernoulli property.  The PI also plans to construct examples of exotic dynamical systems with new ergodic and statistical behavior.  A second research direction relates to recent developments on parabolic systems, of not necessarily algebraic origin.  Despite recent progress, many fundamental questions for such systems are still open, for instance, the Rokhlin problem on higher order mixing.  The PI will build on techniques from his earlier work and try to develop a general theory for ergodic properties of parabolic systems.  A third part of the project will continue the PI?s research on sparse equidistribution problems, using methods from dynamics (such as quantitative equidistribution and mixing) and analytic number theory (such as sieve methods and exponential sums).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project is particularly interested in such rigorous derivations in the case where the many particles are interacting with singular forces, such as the Coulomb force, which is the fundamental electric force of nature. Understanding the statistical behavior of such systems, as well as their dynamical laws, is directly related to fundamental questions in several areas of physics and applied science: the Coulomb gas in statistical physics, models of plasmas in astrophysics and plasma physics, quantum mechanics models, analysis of random matrices (itself initially motivated by the analysis of the spectrum of large atoms), phase transitions in condensed matter physics (superconductors and superfluids), but also collective behavior in biology, social sciences, and neural networks. Recent progress has been made bringing forward new tools from analysis and probability to analyze such questions, with or without randomness, but much remains to be done. The project focuses in particular on two directions. The first is obtaining convergence results for dynamics that are valid for all time and with an explicit error rate, thus useful in practice. The second is in understanding the famous Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition in the so-called ""two component plasma"". This is a two-dimensional gas made of positively and negatively charged particles with electrostatic interaction. Positive particles and negative particles attract and, depending on the temperature, they pair into collapsed dipoles (at low temperature) or behave as free charges (at high temperature). What was an initial surprise is that, according to the Nobel-prize winning prediction of Berezinsky, Kosterlitz, and Thouless, a third, intermediate and new state of matter exists, with quite unusual behavior that is explained by the formation of vortices. Much remains to be rigorously analyzed about this phase transition, and the project hopes to advance this theoretical understanding. The broader impacts of the project stem from its mentoring and training component, expository work, communication and outreach to broader audiences, as well as involvement with the community in various roles. <br/> <br/>The effective or mean-field behavior of systems with singular interactions, in particular Coulombic ones, has been understood for several situations of dynamics and statistical mechanics. In the case of equilibrium statistical mechanics, this consists in examining the behavior of the particle density under the canonical Gibbs measure, and this has been understood via large deviations techniques and potential theory. In the purely repulsive Coulomb case, much more has been understood, including the fluctuations around the mean-field limit and the microscopic behavior of the points. The project further extends this understanding by proving the connection to the Gaussian Multiplicative Chaos in the 2D Coulomb case, and by analyzing non-Coulomb Riesz repulsive interactions, which present further challenges. Much less has been understood about the case of a neutral plasma of oppositely charged particles (which then attract), which makes sense as a two-dimensional system. In particular, the project will turn to understanding the fine behavior of such a two-component Coulomb gas, in which a very particular phase transition, the Berezinski-Kosterlitz-Thouless phase transition, is predicted to happen. Bringing in an electrostatic and large deviations-based approach to this topic will provide a new approach to such problems, alternate to the renormalization methods of quantum field theory, and allow to understand the model below and above the critical temperature, with characterizations of the formation of dipoles and multipoles which explain the phase transition, and analysis of the fluctuations. The last main part of the project turns to gradient flow, conservative dynamics and Newtonian dynamics of systems with Coulomb or Riesz repulsive or attractive interactions. Thanks in particular to the recent modulated energy and modulated free energy methods, the mean-field limit can be derived, but much less has been understood beyond this than in the statistical mechanics setting. The project will allow us to understand whether and when global-in-time convergence holds, questions of instability in the case with attraction, and fluctuations and large deviations away from the mean-field behavior, thus providing much more precise information on such dynamics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given the disparities in the quality and quantity of science education in rural spaces, this project is designed to support and develop two cohorts of grade K-8 Master Teaching Fellows (MTFs) into science teacher leaders in rural South Carolina (SC). One cohort will be comprised of twelve grade K-5 experienced and exemplary teachers and one cohort of twelve grade 6-8 exemplary and experienced teachers. This five-year program consists of several components, including a Leadership Simulation, a Summer Institute, and Summer Conferences. Additional elements of the program that each MTF will undertake are the completion of differentiated online modules designed to support specific learning needs and goals, implementation of a professional learning and leadership plan, collaboration with principals, attending and presenting at the National Science Teacher Association (NSTA) conference, and receiving differentiated coaching in MTF classrooms. The program is designed to allow MTFs to focus on becoming expert science teachers the first two years while learning about themselves as leaders and beginning to think about how change occurs. In the last three years of the program, the focus aims on developing MTFs as leaders, continuing to work on honing leadership knowledge and skills. Ultimately, MTFs will be encouraged to lead in their schools and districts by mentoring, leading professional development, and seeking other ways to support other science teachers. In doing so, the number of science teacher leaders in the SC upstate region will be increased and science education in upstate SC will be impacted. <br/><br/>This project at Clemson University includes partnerships with WestEd?s Making Sense of Science and high-need, rural school districts (Ware Shoals School District, Laurens County School District, and Union County School District), in the upstate region of SC. Project goals include the implementation of differentiated professional development and coaching over the course of five years for two cohorts of teachers to produce teacher leaders who can effect change within their rural schools and school systems. This work is grounded in situated learning and the science teacher leader framework and seeks to explore the following questions. 1) How does change happen in a rural school system via teacher leaders? 2) In what ways does rurality support or hinder teacher leadership? and 3) What are key leverage points in rural spaces that support rigorous science education? A mixed-method investigation of these questions is intended to result in findings that are expected to contribute to the understanding of professional learning and the under-examined field of teacher leadership in the STEM research literature. Project results will be widely disseminated through national and regional channels to improve K-12 science education. The project will collaborate with the South Carolina Department of Education to share asynchronous modules that can be replicated by districts and state subject area coaches as part of their regular professional learning and development for teachers. This study addresses a significant issue in education - the current absence of teacher leaders in STEM disciplines, particularly in rural communities - with the goal of increasing the number of science teacher leaders in the SC upstate region. This Track 3: Master Teacher Fellowships project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Multi-task learning highly reduces the number of parameters in the machine learning models and thus reduces the computational and storage requirements. For example, there are multiple tasks to be done in real-time in self-driving cars, including object detection and depth estimation. If these tasks can be trained on a single model with shared parameters, the model size and the inference time can be highly reduced. This project aims to further compress the model used for multi-task learning as the model size of a single deep neural network is still a critical challenge to many computation systems, especially for edge platforms. This project proposes an approach to learn the difficulty of every task and maintain the performance of the most difficult task when compressing a multi-task learning model. It increases the potential in the compression rate with acceptable performance for all the tasks as the performance of the most difficult task needs to be guaranteed to provide a satisfactory user experience. This project also designs an efficient multi-task federated learning approach for edge platforms. It improves the convergence rate of multi-task federated learning and reduces the communication costs in every iteration.

This sense of alienation may be particularly acute when students? educational backgrounds, prior experiences, and linguistic practices are not reflected in engineering instructors? written or verbal examples and course materials. To counter this sense, the purpose of this project is to develop a model of instructional congruence that connects undergraduates? linguistic practices and experiences with core engineering concepts. This project focuses on undergraduates that have historically been marginalized in engineering courses due to their socioeconomic status, race, ethnicity, or language, including people who identify as African American or Black and Hispanic or Latin. This project is based on the fundamental assumption that language can function to build a sense of belonging in introductory undergraduate engineering courses when instructors encourage the use of students? home languages; when they use everyday language to build understandings of complex disciplinary ideas and practices; and when they connect students? experiences with fundamental engineering concepts through familiar analogies, metaphors, or examples. To explore this assumption, the project will conduct research in introductory electrical engineering courses at five universities, including a Hispanic-Serving Institution, a Historically Black Research University, and Predominantly White Institutions with intentionally inclusive engineering courses. The project will result in an empirically-based, open-access, scalable, and nationally-disseminated model that can be used by undergraduate engineering instructors who seek to build their students? disciplinary expertise and enhance their sense of belonging in engineering through instructionally congruent approaches. <br/><br/>This project will explore how various types of language can support undergraduates in developing disciplinary expertise through building connections between familiar examples and fundamental engineering concepts. To achieve this research purpose, a multi-phase discourse analysis will be performed in introductory engineering courses across five colleges or universities, which were purposively selected to ensure diversity among students, instructors, programs, and institution types. Within this context, the research team will collect numerous data sources, including written course materials, protocols from classroom observations, and transcripts from pre- and post-focus groups with undergraduates. Additionally, the research team will interview the instructors to better understand their rationales behind using specific types of language, including analogies and metaphors, to support student learning. Qualitative content analyses of these data sources will result in a model of instructional congruence that is widely transferrable to institutions and programs across the country. This model will be shared through research publications, workshops, webinars, and a graduate course for instructional faculty. Collectively, these resources will result in actionable knowledge regarding how instructors can use language to foster disciplinary expertise in undergraduate engineering courses, while simultaneously enhancing students? sense of belonging in engineering. This project is supported by NSF's EDU Core Research (ECR) program. The ECR program emphasizes fundamental STEM education research that generates foundational knowledge in the field. Investments are made in critical areas that are essential, broad and enduring: STEM learning and STEM learning environments, broadening participation in STEM, and STEM workforce development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They appear, in different forms, in many areas of mathematics. The central topic will be a study of averages over prime numbers as they appear in an important class of generalizations of prime numbers, the abstract number field settings. This infinite class of prime number fields sheds light on the underlying principles that govern prime numbers. It turns out that the commonalities and differences in proofs about these questions in the number field settings give new insights into traditionally evasive questions about prime numbers. These questions include the so-called Goldbach conjectures, patterns that emerge in prime numbers, as well as related and new questions. The research will be conducted in parallel with a training program for a next generation of STEM students, and emerging researchers. For example, continued training of graduate students will take place, and as well lead a program instructing 700 High School students from about 70 High Schools across the state of Georgia in dual enrollment classes such as Linear Algebra and Vector Calculus.<br/><br/>A vigorous program of study in discrete harmonic analysis will be carried out. A range of questions in the number field setting promise new insights into even classical questions like the Goldbach conjecture in the number field setting. These insights come about by a delicate analysis of the Fourier transforms of averages over prime numbers, as the most accessible example. So, questions about Goldbach conjecture are then related to the second and third order convolutions of the averages. Further questions about multilinear averages in the number field setting will be pursued. Subject to research will be novel questions concerning averages over surfaces that combine important elements of continuous and discrete elements. This research will complement the continuing study of commutators, with a range of new results about the Schatten norms of the operators under investigation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Computational thinking has become an integral part of almost every STEM-related field and is increasingly necessary for secondary students? access to STEM courses and related opportunities in high school and beyond. In addition, multiple scholars have shown that the lack of attention to ethics in STEM research and development has had a negative impact on individuals, society, and the environment. North Carolina teachers have not been adequately supported to integrate computational thinking in their curriculum, much less with attention to ethics. This project will provide support to 24 secondary mathematics and science teaching candidates, each of whom will be matched with a secondary STEM teacher in a partnering high-need school district. The teaching candidates and their secondary mentor teachers will participate in project activities to strengthen their own ethical computational thinking, as well as plan to use it in future lessons. Project activities include learning basic Python coding and engaging in four modules around computational thinking in data science, nanoscience, geography and earth science, and engineering, with ethics fore-fronted in each module. Teaching candidates and mentor teachers will design, implement, reflect on, and analyze the effectiveness of their ethically grounded computational thinking lessons. <br/><br/>This project at the University of North Carolina (UNC) at Charlotte includes a partnership with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools (CMS), the largest school district in North Carolina serving over 150,000 students. Project goals include developing ethical computational thinking (ECT) in three cohorts of eight mathematics and science undergraduate teaching candidates (24 total) over four years, together with 24 practicing secondary STEM teachers in the partner district.  The project aims to do this by consistently engaging teaching candidates and their mentor teachers in activities to develop their computational thinking with a clear focus on ethical implications. Through the evaluation of the project, researchers will gain insights into ways to recruit and develop secondary STEM teachers who are prepared to infuse ethical computational thinking into their teaching, thus better preparing their students to be more competitive when they enter the STEM workforce.

This is especially true for the group of viruses that includes smallpox, one of the deadliest pathogens in human history. A major unanswered question tied to this deadly pandemic is why some species of pox viruses are able to infect multiple animals while others only infect one. In light of the recent outbreak of monkeypox, a pox virus capable of infecting multiple species, the need to better understand host-pox virus diversity and evolution is of particular importance. This project will use novel technologies combined with historic and modern samples of animals housed in natural history museums to expand our understanding of pox virus infection across the tree of life. Additionally, this project advances the goals of the NSF by increasing the STEM workforce. Specifically, this work involves linking a primarily undergraduate-serving institution with partnerships at several premier research institutions in Chicago and beyond, creating a network of opportunities for students engaged in the project. <br/><br/>This project will leverage a large series of historical museum specimens from regions and time periods when pox outbreaks were known to occur, and advance genomic techniques to expand our knowledge of pox-virus evolution and host diversity. The proposed work will focus on three museum collections, targeting: a past outbreak (smallpox); a current outbreak (monkeypox); and finally, an emerging threat (Alaskapox). Viral genomes will be generated from pox-positive samples using a combination of high throughput sequencing and targeted enrichment approaches, allowing researchers to elucidate the evolutionary history of these complex but little-studied pathogens.  Such data will be used to answer a suite of questions related to the evolution of Orthopoxvirus including: 1) How does genome architecture influence host range for different species of pox viruses? 2) Do intermediate hosts or distantly related hosts play a role in Orthopoxvirus diversification or transmission? and 3) Does increasing the known diversity of Orthopoxvirus in mammals help resolve the phylogenetic position and origin of human smallpox?<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Online misinformation poses an alarming threat to public health, democracy, science, and society. Addressing misinformation at scale remains a pressing challenge as current solutions rely on the limited resources of professional fact-checkers or moderators, which neither scales to newly emerging information issues nor directly addresses how to respond to misinformation in situ. This project will address these challenges through developing robust detection models that leverage user-generated responses to social media posts to identify potentially non-credible information. The team will also design a counter-response generation tool that can help everyday users effectively respond to misinformation, leveraging the models developed along with existing fact-checking resources and best practices in communication to suggest possible responses to incorrect posts that will help readers assess them. Together, the proposed work will boost information literacy in society and reduce the number of people exposed to misinformation. The team will also develop interdisciplinary coursework and research opportunities that will broaden both students? toolkits for addressing misinformation in social media systems and the range of students who engage in it.<br/><br/>This project will advance scientific knowledge in misinformation, graph neural networks, adversarial learning, and social network analysis. The general approach is to leverage the social responses that ordinary users make on online posts, such as supporting, questioning, disbelieving, or countering claims, to robustly detect misinformation and suggest corrective responses. Around detection, the project will develop novel signed dynamic graph neural network models and network augmentation methods to address network sparsity issues. Around robustness, the project will create detection models that are robust to adversarial manipulation, by better modeling adversarial attacks carried out by groups of attackers, then creating defenses that optimize against fake response injections into social media comments. Around correction, the project seeks to empower social media users to correct misinformation by developing text generation methods to suggest effective counter-responses to posts estimated to contain information; these methods will be trained on data collected from professional fact-checking organizations and assessed in a series of studies. The project will also result in new models, datasets, benchmarks, and tools around misinformation that will promote future research on these topics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast to established model systems, large collections of gene knock-out mutants are not widely available in emerging model organisms. This limitation greatly diminishes the power of emerging model systems for making novel scientific discoveries. To address the issue, this project will develop a large collection of gene knock-out mutants using CRISPR gene editing in three species of the freshwater microcrustacean Daphnia (D. magna, D. pulex, and D. pulicaria), which is an emerging model system in ecological genomics, evolutionary genomics, and environmental genomics. The Daphnia knock-out mutants will provide unprecedented opportunities for the scientific community to characterize the biological functions of the genes. The project will also disseminate technical expertise for CRISPR gene editing in Daphnia through free workshops, targeting biologists at different career stages including undergraduates, graduates, postdoctoral researchers, and faculty. Furthermore, the project will develop an innovative genomics curriculum to enable hands-on research in the classroom and enhance the education experience of diverse undergraduate students.  <br/><br/>The plan is to knock out genes in Daphnia, including many candidate genes that may play critical roles in acclimation, adaptation, and evolution of these species. Individual knock-out mutant lines will be generated, maintained in the laboratory, and freely shared with the research community. Each mutant line will be whole-genome sequenced to characterize its genomic background. In collaboration with the global Daphnia research community, this project will evaluate the functional changes in knock-out mutants at both genomic and organism levels to validate the role of the genes in various environmental settings and to infer gene interaction and gene regulation networks. Lastly, a free, public-facing database will be developed to host the genomic and phenotypic data of the mutant lines, to promote and manage the distribution of Daphnia mutants, and to distribute experimental protocols and reagents.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wave motion through water, sound waves in air, seismic waves through the earth?s crust, radiation traveling in the vacuum of outer space (satellite communications), pollutants diffusing through groundwater, heat spreading through a machine part, and quantum waves or particles moving at subatomic scales ? all these and more are analyzed by equations involving the same mathematical object, a ""second order rate of change"" operator called (in honor of the 18th century scientist Pierre-Simon Laplace) simply the Laplacian. The ""eigenvalues"" of the Laplacian represent frequencies of wave motion or radiation, rates of spreading for pollutant, speed of heat transfer, and energy levels of particles. This research project promotes the progress of science by discovering new mathematical properties of eigenvalues of the Laplacian for waves, diffusions and particles living in spaces that are not flat like our usual three-dimensional space but are instead curved positively like a sphere or else negatively like a saddle. Problems include the identification of shapes supporting the fastest vibrations, an explanation of why a mysterious ""zeta function"" of eigenvalues depends increasingly on the curvature, understanding how scaling invariance persists in curved spaces through an eigenvalue monotonicity relation, and finding the largest eigenvalues among deformed-sphere surfaces. The project provides research training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students.<br/><br/>The project advances mathematical knowledge at the intersection of analysis, partial differential equations and geometric analysis. Conjectures are addressed for extremal frequencies, energies and diffusions, offering theoretical insights and practical applicability. Conceptual and technical challenges are overcome by synthesizing modern analytic techniques into a suite of tools including variational principles, metric perturbation and monotonicity, conformal mapping, probabilistic coupling, and elliptic partial differential equations (PDE) symmetrization, applied on regions of positive, zero or negative curvature. Free membrane frequencies on the sphere are maximized by differing techniques depending on the presence or absence of holes. Curvature-driven monotonicity of the spectral zeta function is to be derived from new properties of the heat kernel on the spatial diagonal in hyperbolic space and the sphere. On higher dimensional projective space, the third eigenvalue is conjecturally maximized by constructing appropriate trial functions, while for the fourth-order biharmonic landscape function, extremality is investigated by a new kind of two-ball optimization under elliptic symmetrization. The unifying emphasis on maximization of eigenvalues is designed to yield both computable bounds and qualitative insights into the behavior of waves, diffusions and particles in curved geometric spaces.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, randomness is a key ingredient in algorithms used to analyze large data. One of the major questions in such an analysis is understanding if and how a random system converges to an equilibrium. The research in this award will study such convergence depending on the models used. The project includes training graduate students, introducing undergraduate students to research, while the results will be disseminated through publications and presentations at conferences.  <br/>  <br/>The project concerns problems combining probability, analysis, geometry. One of the directions of research is to study limits laws such as small deviations, laws of iterated logarithm and large deviations for hypoelliptic diffusions and random walks. These questions are closely related to the Cameron-Martin-Girsanov type quasi-invariance in hypoelliptic settings, applications to functional inequalities, and smoothness of probability laws in hypoelliptic and singular settings. The methods include diverse probabilistic techniques such as coupling and Dirichlet forms. In particular, research concerns large and small deviations, the Onsager?Machlup functional which can be viewed as an analog of the Lagrangian of a dynamical system, and convergence to equilibrium of a large particle system with singular potentials. Both degeneracy (lack of ellipticity) and high dimensions have to be dealt with new techniques coming from different fields such as probability, ergodic theory and sub-Riemannian geometry. While many of these settings arise naturally in applications, their mathematical analysis is not easy. In addition to the theoretical significance of such questions, some answers have practical uses. For example, the rate of convergence to the equilibrium, its dependence on the number of particles and other parameters, or an explicit form of the rate function have many applications.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is amply documented that the activities of human societies are substantially increasing the extinction rate of species, the loss of genetic variation, and the degradation of ecosystems. This loss imperils many of the services that biodiversity offers such as pollination, pest control, cleansing of water, promoting soil health, and providing resources for innovation in industry and health. Thus, forecasting how the distribution of species change through time is of urgent and critical importance to conserve the remaining biodiversity on this planet. This project will make important contributions to this goal by synthesizing publicly-available data and decades of previous research to develop novel computational models that will realistically predict changes in the distributions of species, communities, and ecosystems. Applications of these models will provide insight into the expansion of invasive species, emergence of human and agricultural diseases, and the impacts of climate change on threatened and endangered species. Results of this project include visual and dynamic maps that will form interactive displays at the University of Kansas Natural History Museum. An important training component is the involvement of a graduate student in the development of the dynamic mathematical models of species distributions as well as the writing of the book and software.<br/> <br/>The synthesis of decades of research and data will culminate in a book and software that will be accessible to the evolution and ecology research community so that the new models developed in this project can be used broadly and extensively across many species and ecological communities around the world. Currently, most models of species distributions are static and based on presence-absence data; this project will incorporate additional data sources such physiology and species interactions to generate dynamic distribution models for those species. Furthermore, this project will use these models from multiple species to represent ecological changes of whole communities and environments through time and to predict biodiversity patterns over entire landscapes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The eggs hatch and develop into larvae, which feed on the body of the insect host from the inside.  Because this is a life-and-death struggle, natural selection acts strongly on the host to evolve to escape parasitism and on the parasitoid to overcome host defenses. When insect pests invade a new region, they usually leave behind the parasitoids that are adapted to attack them. It is expected that in this new, enemy-free environment, evolution could result in an insect host with lower defenses.  Host evolution in response to parasites is important because host resistance impacts biological control programs.  In these programs, enemies from native ranges are introduced intentionally to control invasive insect pests.  When the insect host is once again exposed to its parasitoids, natural selection will once again respond.  This study investigates how defense levels of the spotted wing drosophila have changed following its invasion of North America and how those defenses may change following the release of a specialist parasitoid from the native range.  In addition to broad implications for biological control, the project promises to yield specific insights into control of spotted wing drosophila, which is a major agricultural pest. Lower resistance of invasive spotted wing drosophila could help biocontrol initially, while increased or geographically variable levels of resistance could render biocontrol less successful or less predictable regionally.<br/><br/>This project investigates eco-evolutionary dynamics of host-parasitoid interactions following the release of a classical biocontrol agent, the parasitoid wasp Ganaspis brasiliensis against the invasive spotted wing drosophila (Drosophila suzukii). Contrary to expectations, the resistance of spotted wing drosophila seems to have increased instead of decreased in the invaded range in North America and Europe. This increased resistance may stem from reduced competition and ample resources for spotted wing drosophila in the exotic range, permitting maintenance of high levels of defensive compounds. Preliminary data collected prior to the release of the biocontrol agent show that spotted wing drosophila resistance to parasitism by G. brasiliensis is relatively high but also that it is highly variable with 13-48% of parasitoid larvae being killed by the host. In this project, G. brasiliensis will be released at eight sites in Michigan where there is already baseline data about resistance levels of spotted wing drosophila.  Subsequent surveys will permit assessment of any changes in resistance following this release of a co-evolved specialist natural enemy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This so-called 'molecular editing' technique provides scientists with the capacity to effect profound changes to existing compounds and it may facilitate the design and evaluation of new candidate pharmaceutical agents, advanced materials, and agrochemicals of potential benefit to society. In addition to developing more efficient and effective variants of the nitrogen-deleting transformation of interest, an understanding of its microscopic mechanism will be sought to inform on future variants of the process and to expand upon its range of applicability. The broader impacts of the funded project extend to the training and career development of the diverse team of graduate and undergraduate students conducting the research, many of whom will go on to become a part of the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) workforce. Also under the auspices of the award, Professor Levin and a colleague at the University of Chicago continue their commitment to organizing the recently inaugurated  Future Faculty Conference (FFC), a meeting designed to empower postdoctoral fellows belonging to groups traditionally underrepresented in the chemical sciences with the tools and knowledge necessary to successfully navigate the academic job market. It is envisioned that the annual FFC will help to improve the future diversity of the academy with the expected ancillary benefit of promoting inclusivity in higher education.<br/><br/>The funded project focuses on the in situ generation of isodiazenes from amine substrates and anomeric amide reagents and detailed study of the subsequent transformations of these reactive intermediates, which typically involve extrusion of molecular nitrogen. The investigational plan of the project is divided into two themes. In the first, the development of improved anomeric amide reagents that subvert known decomposition modes of current best-in-class reagents, will be pursued to enable more challenging, weakly nucleophilic amine substrates to be successfully engaged. The challenges of this aim will be addressed through a systematic, computation-aided experimental structure-activity relationship survey of the reagent. The second research theme concerns an examination of the subtle mechanistic differences between how separate substrate classes react and leveraging the findings to develop additional synthetically useful transformations. A better understanding of the rules governing the partitioning of the isodiazene as a function of substrate structure will enable more effective nitrogen deletion reactions to be developed as well as nitrogen insertion, pericyclic rearrangements, and deaminative functionalizations. Each type of process has valuable applications and it is anticipated that the new knowledge emanating from this research will lead to important advances to the theory and practice of molecular editing and to the wider field of synthetic organic chemistry in general.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

They are found in consumer-based polymers (plastics), drinking water, toothpaste, swimming pools, cleaning supplies, and table salt.  In the geosciences they represent one of the key components in ocean water; deeper into our planet, their concentration can affect whether a rock is a molten magma or crystalline at a given temperature. Halogens also affect the mobility and transport of critical elements in the crust like rare earth elements, cobalt, chromium, and copper etc.  While researchers have some basic understanding of halogen interactions between the solid earth and the ocean/atmosphere, there is scant information about distribution and behavior of halogens during the very earliest times of our planet. These early times are important to understand because it is this information that serves as inputs into models that seek to understand the present and future state of Earth.  This research will help to understand the complex connections between: (1) halogens inside of Earth?s rocks and (2) the ocean/atmosphere, and the movement between (1) and (2) through time.  Since there is precious little information from the earliest Earth, the researchers will rely upon a robust geochemical repository (the mineral zircon which resists physical and chemical weathering with ages that extend back to 4.4 billion years), carefully designed laboratory experiments, and mass spectrometry.  This work will educate undergraduate/graduate students in mineralogy, state-of-the art experimental geochemistry/materials science, and mass spectrometry.  These training opportunities have applications that extend beyond the geosciences. <br/><br/>Halogen measurements of these Archean and Hadean zircons will be combined with high-temperature and high-pressure laboratory partitioning experiments to provide context for halogen-in-zircon geochemistry.  Together, this information will be used to explore different halogen cycling models that may have prevailed on the early Earth, the outcome of which would have direct consequences for the composition of the early crust and possibly early Earth surface water chemistry.  This research will yield the first ever detailed F and Cl partition coefficients between zircon-melt and zircon-fluid.  Results will also be used to constrain the F and Cl contents of early Earth igneous systems (zircon-melt). In addition, zircon-fluid partition coefficients will be applied to a previously identified suite of ~3.9 billion- year-old zircons, which crystallized below the wet granite solidus and may record significant early Archean metamorphic or fluid-flow events.  The partitioning studies will enable a broad characterization of halogen exchange between the crust-hydrosphere system and the mantle of the early Earth.  Diffusion studies for Cl and F in zircon will be carried out to better establish the conditions under which zircon will retain primary Cl and F. Finally, new Cl- and F-in-zircon analyses will be undertaken, to better characterize terrestrial halogen cycling.  The researchers will train a PhD student in high P and T experimentation, electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry.  Second, the course ?Principles of Experimental Geochemistry?, will be offered as an upper division hybrid lecture- laboratory-based course designed as an active learning ?studio? format. Third, an undergraduate student will conduct laboratory research directly related to the objectives of this proposal, leading to a senior research thesis.  And finally, the PI will design and build a simple petrographic microscope to enable mineral viewing in plane polarized and cross polarized light to develop a simple educational lesson, using the features of this microscope, for 8-12th grade students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Diversity-focused initiatives can increase access to the field associated with the society, but they may have limited success in improving the inclusion of marginalized members who lack a sense of community or feel their voices are not heard. One way to instigate cultural change from the ground up is to develop affinity groups where members of historically excluded communities can develop support networks based on common experiences and identities. Such affinity groups can go beyond ?one-shot? social events at conferences to build long-lasting communities and connection. This project will develop a mechanism to co-create affinity groups within ornithology that can serve to support members of historically excluded communities, amplify their voices, and empower them to help change the culture of ornithology. This project involves close collaboration between three major US ornithological societies (American Ornithological Society, Wilson Ornithological Society, and Association for Field Ornithologists) to jointly support and elevate marginalized members in ornithology. The ultimate goal is to transform ornithology into an inclusive discipline that leverages the talents of the diverse communities of learners, scientists, and practitioners to solve urgent problems in ecology, conservation, and environmental justice. <br/><br/>A recent diversity assessment conducted by the American Ornithological Society revealed that many individuals from historically excluded groups feel a weaker sense of belonging, feel that their voices are not heard, and feel that they are not valued. These components comprise key elements of transformative resilience: a framework for not only increasing the persistence of individuals from marginalized groups, but to create paths for institutional transformation. This project aims to design a process for co-creating affinity groups?i.e., identity-based groups created by and for members from historically excluded communities?that facilitate transformative resilience. The co-creation process engages marginalized members to imagine an ornithological community where they belong and are valued, and then creates affinity groups based on those visions through a series of workshops with emerging leaders of the communities. The project sets up vast potential for implementing activities that broadens support to historically excluded communities, including targeted professional development, leadership development, improved communication, and social support. The project will have four other categories of broader impacts: (1) fostering stakeholder engagement among three ornithological societies, non-profit organizations, governmental agencies, and minority-serving institutions and societies; (2) providing educational and training opportunities in diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) for a postdoctoral scholar and summer Multicultural Academic Opportunities Program undergraduate scholars; (3) disseminating findings of the project beyond academia; and (4) broadening the diversity of scholars who are engaged in DEIJ research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In particular, Mukamel will explore how the quantum correlation of photons, known as entanglement, which has been extensively studied in quantum computing applications, can be used to control the interaction between molecules and light. The quantum nature of light offers numerous new opportunities for monitoring elementary molecular events through windows that are unavailable by classical light. Models and practical computational tools will be developed for the interpretation and analysis of the proposed measurements. Interpreting the proposed quantum signals will be made by the combination of electronic structure and quantum dynamics simulations with state-of-the-art quantum optics technology. In addition, optical microcavities can manipulate electron and nuclear dynamics by strong light-matter coupling to localized cavity modes, which create hybrid light-matter particles known as polaritons. The collective response of many molecules interacting with the same cavity mode will be investigated. Coherent control schemes will be employed to optimize the proposed nonlinear optical signals. Coincidence measurements of individual entangled photons and quantum interferometry techniques will be employed to probe molecular chirality. Students working on this project will be immersed in frontier research relevant to quantum information science.  Also contributing to the broader impacts, Dr. Mukamel will continue to serve an advisory role on the boards of several worldwide research centers in the field of nonlinear ultrafast spectroscopy and quantum light technology.<br/><br/>Novel spectroscopic techniques that involve optical cavities and quantum light will be developed and applied to study elementary photophysical and photochemical processes in molecules. Computational techniques that combine nonadiabatic molecular dynamics, wavepacket simulations of quantum nuclear degrees of freedom, and quantum photon statistics will be employed.

Stimulated Raman techniques that can directly probe the passage of molecules through conical intersections in microcavities will be predicted. Engineered states of quantum light developed in quantum optics will be adopted to molecular spectroscopy applications with unprecedented temporal, spectral, and spatial resolutions. The back and forth transfer of entanglement between photons and matter will be used to create new classes of correlated excited states in molecular aggregates. The elementary charge and energy migration processes in molecular aggregates and in photosynthesis will be investigated using the new techniques.

Evaluations of prevention programs typically assume that one individual?s behavior does not affect anyone else?s. If individuals exposed to crime intervention transmit their improvements in skills, beliefs, or time use to their peers, ignoring these spillovers could understate or alternatively overstate an intervention?s total impact.  This project will document how changes in criminal behavior spread through social networks by combining four existing experiments with measures of social networks derived from multiple sources of administrative data. It will quantify the direct and indirect effects of these violence-reduction interventions on participants and their peers. The results will generate a better understanding of the overall effect of each program, as well as the role of peers in shaping criminal decision-making more broadly. The project will provide actionable information on how to effectively target crime prevention programs in the future by describing whom program operators should serve to maximize net crime reduction benefits.  The results will also help to establish the US as global leader in crime reducing policies.  <br/><br/><br/>This project will estimate the effects of social networks on crime intervention programs.  Estimating social spillovers faces two key challenges: measuring social networks and causally identifying peer effects. This research addresses the first challenge by combining population-wide administrative police and school records in Chicago to capture different kinds of social connections. The PIs solve the second challenge by combining the network information with exogenous variation in crime and violence generated by four existing RCTs in Chicago, all  focusing on low income youth. Using these data, the PIs will construct the social network between individuals at the time each intervention was randomly assigned. The random variation from the RCTs will allow the PIs to test whether and how treatment changes behavior?both via direct participation and via indirect exposure to treated peers?as well as which types of social ties matter. The PIs will test for heterogeneity in peer effects based on demographic, criminal history, and network characteristics of individuals to help understand and model how social interactions generate criminal decisions. Finally, the PIs will us the model to evaluate alternative targeting strategies for future RCTs. The results of this research project will provide important inputs into policies to decrease crime and thus improve public safety in the US.

Cancer is caused by driver mutations, which are changes in the DNA sequence of genes that lead to the development of abnormal cells that divide uncontrollably and can infiltrate and destroy normal body tissue. One main goal of cancer research has been the discovery of all the driver mutations across cancer types. However, cancer driver discovery is very challenging as each person?s cancer has a unique combination of mutations, among which only a few are driver mutations while the vast majority are passenger mutations that do not promote abnormal cell growth. Existing cancer driver discovery methods can detect drivers that are common among many tumors but fail to detect rare drivers that only occur in very few tumor cases. This project will apply state-of-the-art machine learning approaches to identify the remaining elusive rare drivers. The identified driver mutations may provide critical information for planning treatment to stop cancer cells from growing, including drugs that target a specific driver mutation. The acquired knowledge and framework from this project will contribute to saving numerous lives by providing the capability to better manage cancer treatments. <br/><br/>One major barrier for applying advanced machine learning approaches, such as deep neural network models, to cancer driver discovery is the lack of large-scale high-quality labeled training data suitable for supervised learning. To address this challenge, this project will combine Graph Neural Network (GNN), Self-Supervised Learning, and Meta Learning techniques to integrate biological domain knowledge with large-scale heterogeneous data (specifically known as multi-omics data in this community) for cancer driver discovery. First, a GNN model will be constructed based on a unified knowledge graph representing biological domain knowledge. Incorporating domain knowledge into the model as a form of inductive bias will help train the model effectively with less labeled data. Second, self-supervised learning will be employed to pre-train the GNN model on multi-omics data, also reducing the need for labeled data. Meanwhile, the learned node and edge embeddings for the GNN model can be treated as high-level transferrable features, removing heterogeneity and noise while facilitating cross-dataset integration and meta learning. Third, meta learning will be applied to a pan-cancer dataset comprising dozens of cancer types to increase model generalizability and detect novel drivers across cancer types. The project will further improve the results of existing pan-cancer integrative analysis of dozens of cancer types and may lead to a repeatable process for tackling other difficult biological problems through integrating heterogeneous data and knowledge sources with machine learning.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many of these species existed long before humans. They evolved to fill critical roles in ecosystems on which humanity relies for food, clean air, clean water, fertile soils, and a host of other services that make life possible and comfortable on this planet. For decades conservation efforts have focused primarily on saving select species. Unfortunately, such approaches do not encompass the bulk of biodiversity or the more complex interactions among species. These approaches leave gaps in scientific understanding of ecosystem level processes and interactions needed to implement effective conservation actions. This is especially evident for high diversity but poorly studied groups like snails, which account for the highest number of recorded extinctions in human history. Hawaiian Island land snails include some of the most diverse groups of snails on the planet. They are also among the most heavily impacted by extinction, with more than half of the more than 750 known species already lost. Saving the remaining species and restoring these jewels of the Hawaiian forests requires knowledge of species interactions and their ecological requirements. Understanding why land snails live where they do, what they feed on, and what their other habitat requirements are is critical to successful captive rearing of the remaining species and to returning them to the wild in protected and restored habitats. In addition, this project will help fill the human resource capacity shortfall by providing conservation experiences and broadening participation of groups underrepresented in science and conservation specifically. Students and researchers will engage and contribute to a broader understanding of ecology, applied conservation, and the biology of lesser-known groups like snails. At a deeper community level, this will expand knowledge and engagement with indigenous practices and ways of understanding. Hawaiian land snails hold deep cultural presence and Hawaiians hold generations of natural history insights about the natural world. This project will help bridge biocultural land snail knowledge with physical objects, natural history data, and genomics. Collectively, this will increase stewardship and sustainability of environmental resources, support conservation management efforts through indigenous value systems, and instill appreciation and protection of our precious resources for generations. <br/><br/>Researchers will incorporate studies in microbial genomics, field ecology, and captive rearing diets that address the most urgent knowledge gaps in Hawaiian land snail ecology. By examining resource preferences and feeding ecology of Hawaiian lands snails this project will 1) determine snail feeding preferences on bacteria and fungi that grow on their native host plants; 2) characterize the microbial communities that likely form key components of snail diets; and 3) identify preferred plants and microbial communities that improve snail survivorship and breeding in captivity. The data gathered will be used to expand captive rearing capacity, restore degraded habitats with preferred plant resources, and build long term capacity for effective land snail conservation in Hawaii. Knowing which microbial assemblages enhance snail survivorship, growth, and fecundity will provide conservationists with a powerful tool to assess quality of snail habitat. It will also enable restoration practitioners to create habitats to support extant populations in the wild.<br/><br/>This project is being supported via a joint program involving the Divisions of Environmental Biology and Integrative Organismal Systems and the Paul G.

The sequencing of genomic data found in nature is now democratized, opening the door to a digital library of countless documents of evolutionary history. In parallel, the synthesis of engineered DNA for widespread societal benefits is now automated and affordable, showing incredible promise in recent years. Indeed, recent advances in reading and writing DNA have the potential to resolve major global challenges, such as boosting crop yield to address food shortages, mitigating pollution through carbon capture, and improving pandemic response and preparedness. While these remarkable technological advances can be used for broad societal benefit, they are underutilized for tracking yet-unseen pathogens that can result in widespread economic and public harm. Our ability to read and write DNA at scale, especially with respect to uncovering yet-unseen pathogens and intentionally or unintentionally enhancing existing pathogens, has far outstripped computational tools capable of tracking and preventing misuse. To address this critical gap, the research detailed in this proposal will focus on developing computational tools to aid in detecting yet-unseen pathogens and preventing intentional or unintentional misuse of synthetic DNA. <br/><br/>This project will advocate for a novel paradigm of pathogen detection and monitoring through the pursuit of innovative computational methods and approaches. The research methodology will be motivated by tried and tested approaches in biosurveillance while pursuing innovative computational strategies. Specifically, this project will address four fundamental computational research challenges: (1) yet-unseen pathogen characterization -- contextualizing taxonomy-based approaches with functions of concern to learn how to identify novel pathogens, (2) petabyte-scale cataloging of microbial dark matter -- combining probabilistic algorithm development with comparative genomic approaches for the query of known and rare microbial genes, (3) genetic engineering detection -- discerning engineered DNA from naturally occurring DNA through the development of graph-based pan genomes combined with codon usage bias models, and (4) implementation of the modular computational platform GuarDNA -- integrating everything together into the first-ever comprehensive platform specifically designed for both biosecurity and biosurveillance. GuarDNA will be designed following software engineering best practices, with code modularity as a key focus to facilitate community engagement. These four research challenges will be accompanied by a comprehensive test and evaluation plan, which both provides an individual assessment of each of the four research thrusts as well as continuous integration testing to provide an overarching evaluation of the GuarDNA platform. This research effort will open the door to novel computational approaches for biosecurity and biosurveillance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate models disagree about future precipitation changes in the region. Much of this disagreement is from uncertainty about the future position of the jet stream over the eastern Pacific Ocean. This project seeks to reduce this uncertainty by reconstructing the past position of the jet stream using hydrogen isotopes from leaf waxes. These isotopes will be measured in ocean and lake sediment cores from the region. The project focuses on two past warm climate periods that are similar to future climate projections: the Pliocene (3 million years ago) and the last Interglacial (125,000 years ago). Changes in leaf wax hydrogen isotope values are thought to constrain the position of the jet stream during both these intervals. These data will be paired with climate model simulations to investigate the link between sea surface temperatures and jet stream position. Ultimately, this helps identify the model configurations most likely to predict future changes in jet stream position and precipitation in the western US. The research program is integrated into an educational program called SUSTAIN. This program supports first-generation students pursuing a STEM degree. This work will support independent research projects and the development of a mentoring network. Project personnel will develop seminars on careers in environmental fields, helping recruit and retain the next generation of climate scientists. <br/><br/>Models disagree about the pattern and magnitude of future rainfall change in western North America, hindering climate adaptation in this drought-prone region. The project generates new paleoclimatic constraints on the sensitivity of this region?s rainfall to climate change. The project will reconstruct atmospheric circulation over western North America during two warm climate intervals, the last Interglacial and the mid-Pliocene. Both these intervals featured reorganizations of tropical and midlatitude sea surface temperatures that serve as ?natural experiments? to investigate the response of western North American rainfall to large-scale ocean temperature gradients. The project integrates modern climate observations, leaf wax hydrogen and carbon isotope measurements, and model simulations to develop a new rigorous, interpretation of latitudinal gradients of leaf wax hydrogen isotopes and how they can be used as direct constraints on changes in the position of atmospheric circulation features like the subtropical jet. The project then applies these insights to reconstruct changes in jet position during the last Interglacial and mid-Pliocene. New leaf wax isotopic data, in conjunction with isotope-enabled model simulations, will be used to identify the model configurations that provide the most reliable long-term projections of this vulnerable region?s precipitation and water resources.

In particular, the new MTFs will serve as excellent mentors to the ""GOTMath"" Student-Scholars as the latter earn their STEM bachelor?s degree and become new teachers in the district?s high-need schools. The Master Teaching Fellows will be engaged in a research-based Leadership Initiative which seeks to develop the Fellows? capacity to improve opportunities for a diverse body of students by offering inclusive mathematics experiences. The Leadership Initiative will help the Fellows to become future school leaders who can mentor less experienced teachers to be more effective. The Master Teaching Fellows will complete a Master of Science in Mathematics degree and participate in teaching and leadership workshops offered by the project?s many partners. They will become the next generation of math teacher-leaders vitally needed to create schools that are sites of success for all students.<br/><br/>This project brings together nine partners: the Central Valley Higher Education Consortium; Fresno County Superintendent of Schools; San Joaquin Valley Mathematics Project; the California State University (CSU) Mathematics and Science Teacher Initiative; and five high-need school districts (Fresno, Sanger, Reef-Sunset, Central, and Mendota), who collectively will recruit and mentor 18 master?s-level teachers from the participating school districts. The project rests on four proven methods for building an effective teaching workforce: (1) multipurpose mentoring; (2) increasing the number of teacher-leaders who are individuals who identify as members of racial and ethnic populations that are underrepresented in STEM disciplines relative to their numbers in the general population; (3) investing in local teachers; and (4) implementation of the concept of ""Lesson Study,"" in which a school-based community of teachers collaborates to develop and share approaches to improving classroom instruction. The project's assessment will target three questions: (1) In what ways do activities influence the participants? understanding of mathematics teacher leadership? (2) How do activities contribute to the growth of a Fellow as a teacher of mathematics, an educational researcher, and a leader? (3) In what ways do Teacher Leaders influence their colleagues in their schools to improve mathematics teaching?

As such, the current datacenter network suffers from the overhead of the multi-layered software stack, complex network protocol processing, frequent data movement, and network device management. The project novelty is to leverage hardware specialization and near-data processing to re-architect a datacenter?s network.

This project continues the highly successful series of SHINE workshops for the next five years; SHINE workshops have been held annually since 1995 and annually as stand-alone meetings since 1999. The SHINE workshop has a strong participation by students and post-doctoral researchers, representing about 30% of the whole participant population. SHINE students supported by NSF funding have been organizing a student-only student day on the Sunday preceding the workshop, which will continue with this award. Overall, SHINE provides a unique opportunity for students to participate and organize a workshop in the solar, interplanetary and heliospheric communities. <br/><br/>SHINE research focuses in particular upon: (i) the connection between events and phenomena on the Sun and their relation to solar wind structures in the heliosphere; (ii) the origin and evolution of the solar wind; (iii) the nature of turbulence in the interplanetary medium; and (iv) the production and transport of solar energetic particles from the Sun through the heliosphere. The goal of SHINE activities is to enrich and strengthen both the physical understanding and predictive capabilities for these phenomena. Further details about SHINE can be found at http://www.helioshine.org/. The goals of SHINE are parallel to those of NSF?s GEM and CEDAR programs. This project will contribute in creating collaborations between researchers to move towards more advanced studies of the solar-terrestrial system. These collaborations made possible by the workshop are expected to improve our present understanding of the basic physical processes underlying the Sun-Earth system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, ecological restoration is extremely challenging. It requires building partnerships across researchers, conservationists, and managers to co-develop, test, and refine new science-informed solutions that will improve restoration success, lower costs, and increase efficiency. Restoration in coastal systems has historically taken a single-species approach that focuses on reducing environmental stress, avoiding competition, and excluding interactions with other organisms. Previous work by the investigators is challenging this paradigm and has demonstrated that beneficial interactions among and across species are key to organismal and ecosystem resistance to the high physical stress that is common in restoration. Harnessing mutually beneficial, or positive species interactions has the potential to increase restoration yields at little or no extra cost. This project unites non-profit restoration practitioners with scientists to test and systematically incorporate mutually beneficial interactions in large-scale restoration to increase habitat growth, resistance to environmental stress, and re-establish biodiversity. This work will occur in three invaluable coastal ecosystems that have severely declined due to anthropogenic activities and therefore are the target of extensive conservation efforts ? oyster reefs, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows. Results of this work will inform restoration strategies and be integrated into easy to understand training materials (e.g. step-by-step guides and workshops) that will be distributed to interested stakeholders. This work will support and train a number of conservation scientists across the research institutions and other organizations, and provide hands-on training and demonstrative case-studies of new and easy to implement restoration techniques. <br/><br/>Foundation species, such as salt marsh grass, seagrasses, and oysters, are habitat-forming organisms that create locally stable conditions for other organisms. Secondary foundation species (SFS) are habitat-forming organisms that establish after and within a primary foundation species (PFS) that further modify and enhance ecosystem functions and structure. Inclusion of facilitation between co-occurring primary and secondary foundation species in restoration designs has the potential to increase ecosystem regrowth as well as elevate biodiversity of inhabitants and climate resistance. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to work in concert with conservation organizations to test and co-design evidence-based approaches that restore secondary foundation species to increase the growth of primary foundation species and site biodiversity, while enhancing key ecosystem functions (e.g., climate resistance of restored habitats). Specifically, this project will: 1) Test how enhancing previously restored sites with either complementary or similar SFS at both low and high abundances affects PFS growth, local biodiversity, and key ecosystem functions, 2) Co-restore PFS with either complementary or similar SFS at both low and high abundances in a fully-factorial experiment to test for the relative ability to increase PFS growth, local biodiversity, and important ecosystem functions in newly restored systems, and 3) Survey previously restored habitats and reference sites to quantify and correlate SFS abundance and complementarity with changes in PFS abundance, local biodiversity and ecosystem function to test the generality of SFS effects.<br/><br/>This project is being supported via a joint program involving the Divisions of Environmental Biology and Integrative Organismal Systems and the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Liquid helium enables a broad range of low temperature technologies and is crucial to superconducting instrumentation. It is essential that the community move to conserve and recycle helium from the boil-off of these instruments so that new discoveries to improve the intellectual and physical wellbeing of society can continue.  This project will allow recovery of helium from the LSU Chemistry Department?s Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) facility as well as the Center for Advanced Microstructures and Devices (CAMD) synchrotron light source.  The boil-off helium gas from these facilities will be collected, compressed, and transported to the LSU?s existing Physics Department Helium Recovery and Liquefaction Center to be re-liquefied and returned for re-use.  <br/><br/>The superconducting magnets in the LSU NMR facility and the two superconducting insertion devices at the LSU CAMD synchrotron collectively consume a significant volume of liquid helium per year, all of which is currently lost to boil-off. This helium recovery project involves the installation of equipment at each site consisting of gas collection bags, compressors, and recovery gas manifolds to capture this helium boil-off for reliquefaction and re-use.  The high rate of recovery expected will be monitored and reported back to NSF.

Assessing the full scope of these challenges requires going beyond what is physically visible or on the surface of these environments. This is especially the case in coastal and island environments with karst, landscapes in which water forms a distinct topography including caves, sinkholes, and groundwater aquifers. Past and ongoing exploration, scientific study, and conservation work in the coastal karst systems in the US territory of Puerto Rico (PR) illustrate what is at stake with the study and conservation of karst. While 20% of the United States (US) is karst, it is the source of 40% of the American public?s drinking water. In Puerto Rico these values are much higher, given that 37% of the territory is karst. <br/><br/>Drawing from theories and methods in Science and Technology Studies (STS), anthropology, and geography, this collaborative project between West Virginia University and the American Geophysical Union examines the past and current role of mostly non-traditional actors and their volunteer-based organizations dedicated to the exploration, science, and conservation of karst in its varied forms. This knowledge will make an original contribution to the history, present challenges, and future of geology, archaeology, and other kindred sciences focused on critical zones environments in the US. Data will include archival information, interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic field-based visits with participants. This data will be used to generate the spatial and social networks undergirding coastal karst science and conservation efforts mostly carried out by cave explorers, scientists, conservation practitioners and volunteers. The STS-informed Ecologies of Participation Framework will inform this network analysis which aims to operationalize the who, what, and how of participation in ongoing socio-technical and environmental change. Results will be disseminated in both Spanish and English to a broader audience using ArcGIS StoryMaps, an effective web-based and interactive platform. These results will not only be valuable for communities living on or near karst systems everywhere, but they are also important for the general public given karst?s national and cultural value.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With yearly costs of about 800 billion and an estimated 50 million people afflicted per year, brain diseases are a grand challenge for scientists. Presently, there is no effective cure for brain diseases (especially glioblastoma) despite the efforts of many investigators and significant financial investment. There is a pressing and unmet need for miniaturized deep tissue imaging tools that can help neuro-oncologist study the fundamental mechanism of brain tumor and the dynamics in the ligand-receptor interactions. This project will be focused on the development of a tiny microscope for molecularly targeted imaging on freely behaving small animals. The ultimate goal of this research is to provide advanced biomedical tools to drive advancements in both scientific understanding and future clinical applications. The techniques may lead to new imaging-guided surgery and therapies for clinicians to improve the quality of life for a sizable population. The generalized molecular imaging strategies will be applied to other organs, such as the breast, lung, and colon. Interdisciplinary educational activities will be developed for MSU and surrounding communities (Greater Lansing) with emphasis on increasing participation by women and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>This project aims to conduct research leading to head-mounted near-infrared-II confocal fluorescence microscope that allows in vivo longitudinal cellular resolution imaging of brain tumor with deep penetration (1000m) for studying molecular contrast agents targeting tumor biomarkers associated with brain diseases, including glioblastoma.

For example, the superconducting magnets of Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectrometers need periodic refills of liquid helium to maintain persistent magnetic fields. Severe shortages of helium have forced the mothballing of some instruments, which adversely impacts many NSF-funded and other projects throughout the region. Responsible resource utilization that minimizes waste by recycling gaseous helium exhaust protects present research activities and preserves this non-renewable resource, enabling future generations to continue to advance national and global health, prosperity, and welfare. Furthermore, information about the requested equipment is being integrated into a comprehensive outreach effort to engage individuals from underrepresented groups, recruit and retain faculty, staff and students, and enhance the classroom and research environment at the University of Kansas.<br/><br/>The nine instruments being served by the helium recovery equipment are distributed across four separate buildings. Successful execution of this project demonstrates the feasibility of a hub-and-spoke model for other institutions needing to recover helium from dispersed devices. This project involves 1) fabrication of manifolds using off-the-shelf parts to collect helium exhaust without disturbing instrument operation; 2) short-term storage of helium in 8500-liter bags; 3) compression of collected gas into high-pressure cylinders for transport to a centralized facility on campus; 4) purification and liquefaction of the gas; and 5) reuse of the resulting liquid helium in scientific instruments. In one year of operation, it is estimated that ~2,400 liters of liquid helium will be recycled by this system. This recovered helium will be used to refill superconducting NMR magnets and to supply the cryostats of Electron Paramagnetic Resonance and Magnetic Circular Dichroism spectrometers. This helium recovery system will secure essential supplies for scientific instrumentation that plays a crucial role in NSF-funded and other research projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project will develop new algorithms that enhance the applicability of SDM and improve its efficiency. Performance guarantees for the algorithms will be obtained and they will be tested in real-world data experiments. The project outcomes can lead to increased use of SDM in industry sectors such as e-commerce and drug design.

In the first problem of subset selection, the objective is to select a good subset among many alternatives. This objective is formulated as a subset selection problem in multi-armed bandit models. The project will develop SDM algorithms that obtain a good subset using the gaps between consecutive arm means. This removes the need to specify a parameter that defines the good subset. The SDM algorithms will exploit arm features in linear multi-armed bandit models and the theoretical analysis will obtain sample complexity bounds for the proposed algorithms. In the second problem of black-box optimization, such arm features are not available, and partition-based optimization methods are often used. This project will develop SDM algorithms that adapt the partitioning scheme to the black-box function being optimized. Convergence to the optimal value will be ensured and their practical performance on benchmark simulations will be measured.

Unfortunately, they have<br/>grown to be complex and have not kept pace with advances in<br/>programming languages and modular software design, instead struggling<br/>to meet modern security and reliability threats to our computing<br/>infrastructure.  Moreover, there appears to be no clear path to<br/>incrementally evolve them and their unchecked complexity has become a<br/>significant barrier to entry for students and practitioners to learn<br/>or innovate at the kernel level.  This project seeks to remedy this<br/>issue by create a safe kernel extension framework within the legacy OS<br/>kernel that enables it to be replaced in part or in its entirety with<br/>safe components.  Through this extension framework, the project will<br/>enable a practical, incrementally-adoptable mechanism for<br/>undergraduate, graduate students and practitioners to evolve kernels<br/>to be safer and more reliable, improving national security and leading<br/>to higher productivity for society and the national economy.<br/><br/>This project aims to achieve three goals for the OS kernel: security<br/>and robustness through language safety, robustness and incremental<br/>update through componentization, and practical relevance through<br/>building upon existing kernel extension frameworks. The key insight in<br/>our approach is that a safe kernel extension framework can be created<br/>within the legacy OS kernel that enables any part of it to be replaced<br/>via bypass extensions, evolving the kernel towards a safe,<br/>componentized architecture, or in its entirety with a safe and<br/>specialized in-situ kernel.  Our integrated research and education<br/>plan involves three broad research thrusts. First, we will explore<br/>expressiveness/safety tradeoffs for kernel extensions, and will design<br/>a new Rust-based kernel extension environment that provides similar<br/>safety guarantees with a more expressive programming environment than<br/>the popular eBPF kernel extension framework in Linux. Second, we will<br/>explore to what extent our enhanced safe kernel extensions can replace<br/>individual kernel components with bypass extensions and explore new<br/>component boundaries in Linux. Finally, we will explore to what extent<br/>an entirely new in-situ kernel can be created from extensions,<br/>ultimately in the context of Linux.

Climate projections indicate that the Arctic will continue to warm, but uncertainties arise due to questions about the future behavior of Arctic clouds.  An area of primary uncertainty is the properties of clouds that form during cold-air outbreaks, where very cold airmasses over the Arctic ice move southward over the relatively warm open ocean.  This award will help to provide observational data of these clouds (and precipitation) and the exchange of energy between the ocean and atmosphere during the Cold-Air outbreak Experiment in the Sub-Arctic Region (CAESAR), which will be conducted in Spring 2024 out of northern Scandinavia.  The observations collected during CAESAR will be used in an effort to better understand the characteristics of the cold-air outbreak system, and the Arctic climate system more broadly, in order to inform climate models and projections.  The project will also help to improve forecasting of weather hazards with significant relevance to naval operations, commercial shipping, and coastal communities.  The broader field effort includes significant opportunities for students and early-career scientists, international collaboration, and public outreach.  One specific goal of this award is the development of interactive worksheets/notebooks for courses, based on the CAESAR project.  <br/><br/>This award will contribute to the CAESAR goal of examining the impact of varying aerosol conditions in the upstream Arctic boundary layer on ice initiation, cloud liquid water, and snow growth mechanisms in a range of wind and temperature regimes.  In particular, the measurements provided through this project will target two critical knowledge gaps:  1) understanding the budget of marine boundary layer (MBL) cloud condensation nuclei (CCN) sources, and 2) providing observational constraints on CCN-limited aerosol indirect effect.  The project will support the deployment of two CCN counters, a scanning mobility particle sizer (SMPS), an ultra-high sensitivity aerosol spectrometer (UHSAS), and a single particle soot photometer (SP2).  The research team will contribute two value-added products to support the overall CAESAR objectives:  quality-controlled cloud condensation nuclei activation spectra to support aerosol-cloud-precipitation modeling investigators and derived cloud droplet number probability distribution functions to support observational and modeling colleagues.<br/><br/>Primary funding for this project comes from the Physical and Dynamic Meteorology program with partial funding from the Arctic Natural Sciences program.

In many species, including humans, different individuals respond very differently to novelty. However, it is still poorly understood what causes differences in neophobia among individuals. The proposed work will help fill this knowledge gap by testing whether individual variation in one key brain region, the hippocampus, can help explain individual variation in neophobia. This work will build on previous research on a well-studied wild songbird, the house sparrow, and take advantage of wide and repeatable individual variation in neophobia in this species. Through three linked research and educational aims, this research will engage a diverse population of undergraduate students in an active research program in the neurobiology of behavior, and develop a clear and replicable approach for how to combine research and teaching at a large public university. This research will also provide critical insights into how differences in neurobiology can lead to differences in behavior, and reveal how social experiences may change the brain to decrease fearful behavior towards novelty. This, in turn, will help us understand the ability of animals to adapt to environmental change. <br/><br/>Neophobia may be particularly important in determining why some individuals, populations, and species are able to persist in human-altered landscapes while others are not. The proposed research will combine transcriptomics, molecular biology, endocrinology, neurobiology, and individual and social behavior to significantly advance our mechanistic understanding of this critical behavioral phenotype. These projects will also provide essential data about how different brain regions mediate the ways animals perceive and respond to the world, and how evolution has conserved or modified the functions of those regions and molecular mediators within those regions.  The first aim will use classic experimental neuroendocrine methods to temporarily inactivate the caudal dorsomedial hippocampus and test the role of two neuroendocrine receptors (dopamine receptor 2 and estrogen receptor beta) that show expression differences in neophobic and non-neophobic birds. The second aim will use PhosphoTRAP to assess whether an observed change in neophobia in response to social learning is associated with altered novelty-seeking and anxiety-related gene expression in hippocampal neurons. The third aim will expand the scope of this research by developing a new Course-based Undergraduate Research Experience (CURE) lab through the highly successful LSU CURE program to test whether neophobia is part of a behavioral syndrome in house sparrows, and to examine gene expression in brain regions connected to the hippocampus in birds exposed to a social learning paradigm.

Diversity initiatives can increase access to the field associated with the society, but they may have limited success in improving the inclusion of marginalized members who lack a sense of community or feel their voices are not heard. One way to instigate cultural change from the ground up is to develop affinity groups where members of historically excluded communities can develop support networks based on common experiences and identities. Such affinity groups can go beyond ?one-shot? social events at conferences to build long-lasting communities and connection. This project will develop a mechanism to co-create affinity groups within ornithology that can serve to support members of historically excluded communities, amplify their voices, and empower them to help change the culture of ornithology. This project involves close collaboration between three major US ornithological societies (American Ornithological Society, Wilson Ornithological Society, and Association for Field Ornithologists) to jointly support and elevate marginalized members in ornithology. The ultimate goal is to transform ornithology into an inclusive discipline that leverages the talents of the diverse communities of learners, scientists and practitioners to solve urgent problems in ecology, conservation and environmental justice. <br/><br/>A recent diversity assessment conducted by the American Ornithological Society revealed that many members from historically excluded groups feel a weaker sense of belonging, feel that their voices are not heard, and that they are not valued. These components comprise key elements of transformative resilience: a framework for not only increasing the persistence of individuals from marginalized groups, but to create paths for institutional transformation. This project aims to design a process for co-creating affinity groups?i.e., identity-based groups created by and for members from historically excluded communities?that facilitate transformative resilience. The co-creation process engages marginalized members to imagine an ornithological community where they belong and are valued, and then creates affinity groups based on those visions through a series of workshops with emerging leaders of the communities. The project sets up vast potential for implementing activities that broadens support to historically excluded communities, including targeted professional development, leadership development, improved communication, and social support. The project will have four other categories of broader impacts: (1) fostering stakeholder engagement among three ornithological societies, non-profit organizations, governmental agencies, and minority-serving institutions and societies; (2) providing educational and training opportunities in diversity, equity, inclusion, and justice (DEIJ) for a postdoctoral scholar and summer Multicultural Academic Opportunities Program undergraduate scholars; (3) disseminating findings of the project beyond academia; and (4) broadening the diversity of scholars who are engaged in DEIJ research.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Gaps exist in understanding how a drought propagates and intensifies across different components of the water cycle, especially in snowy, mountainous areas. Seasonal snowmelt supplies millions of people across the western U.S. with a significant fraction of their water resources. This project aims to address open questions by characterizing the rate of drought onset, its drivers, and how these factors influence drought impacts. Rates of propagation among different types of droughts (e.g., a lack of snow water equivalent [snow drought], streamflow [hydrological drought], and soil moisture [agricultural drought]) will be quantified. The severity, duration, timing, and intensification rate of how one type of drought influences the characteristics and lag of another will be studied. How these relationships vary in space and time using state-of-the-art data, models, and observations will be elucidated. Findings from this research are targeted to help build more sustainable communities, developing climate resilient infrastructure and managing water resources in areas where snow is a vital freshwater resource.<br/><br/>The project will develop a new multivariate framework for understanding drought characteristics and propagation in snowy areas. Investigating the impact of snow variability, drivers of drought, and the rate of drought onset will inform water management and drought monitoring. Given the lag between snow and streamflow deficits, this analysis aims to yield insight into drought prediction. The project will assess how and to what extent the onset rate, drivers of snow drought, and antecedent conditions will influence the amount of water in other states/fluxes (e.g., soil moisture, runoff).  Also, new multivariate drought indices from this research will enable quantification of drought severity in snowy areas across the globe, which will be critical in a warming climate. Findings and methods are expected to improve streamflow forecasts, sustainable water resources management and engineering, and drought assessment at sub-seasonal and interannual time scales. Results will be shared with the broader community via presentations at scientific meetings, peer-reviewed journal publications, and online data repositories (e.g., CUAHSI?s Hydroshare). Since snow and drought impact numerous areas beyond water management and engineering, findings should impact other sectors of society and guide decision making in agriculture, economics, and urban planning. The multivariate drought frameworks from this research will be freely provided to the public so water agencies, scientists, and engineers can benefit from their application. Also, a hands-on Drought Education Toolbox (DET) to integrate novel snow and drought research into engineering education will be developed. DET allows users to study the role of snow in drought. The PI works with existing programs that promote diversity in STEM and the development of minority students at California State University, Long Beach, to mentor underrepresented students in research.

They are found in consumer-based polymers (plastics), drinking water, toothpaste, swimming pools, cleaning supplies, and table salt.  In the geosciences they represent one of the key components in ocean water; deeper into our planet, their concentration can affect whether a rock is a molten magma or crystalline at a given temperature. Halogens also affect the mobility and transport of critical elements in the crust like rare earth elements, cobalt, chromium, and copper etc.  While researchers have some basic understanding of halogen interactions between the solid earth and the ocean/atmosphere, there is scant information about distribution and behavior of halogens during the very earliest times of our planet. These early times are important to understand because it is this information that serves as inputs into models that seek to understand the present and future state of Earth.  This research will help to understand the complex connections between: (1) halogens inside of Earth?s rocks and (2) the ocean/atmosphere, and the movement between (1) and (2) through time.  Since there is precious little information from the earliest Earth, the research team will rely upon a robust geochemical repository (the mineral zircon which resists physical and chemical weathering with ages that extend back to 4.4 billion years), carefully designed laboratory experiments, and mass spectrometry.  This work will educate undergraduate/graduate students in mineralogy, state-of-the art experimental geochemistry/materials science, and mass spectrometry.  These training opportunities have applications that extend beyond the geosciences. <br/><br/>Halogen measurements of these Archean and Hadean zircons will be combined with high-temperature and high-pressure laboratory partitioning experiments to provide context for halogen-in-zircon geochemistry.  Together, this information will be used to explore different halogen cycling models that may have prevailed on the early Earth, the outcome of which would have direct consequences for the composition of the early crust and possibly early Earth surface water chemistry.  This research will yield the first ever detailed F and Cl partition coefficients between zircon-melt and zircon-fluid.  Results will also be used to constrain the F and Cl contents of early Earth igneous systems (zircon-melt). In addition, zircon-fluid partition coefficients will be applied to a previously identified suite of ~3.9 billion- year-old zircons, which crystallized below the wet granite solidus and may record significant early Archean metamorphic or fluid-flow events.  The partitioning studies will enable a broad characterization of halogen exchange between the crust-hydrosphere system and the mantle of the early Earth.  Diffusion studies for Cl and F in zircon will be carried out to better establish the conditions under which zircon will retain primary Cl and F. Finally, new Cl- and F-in-zircon analyses will be undertaken, to better characterize terrestrial halogen cycling.  The PI will train a PhD student in high P and T experimentation, electron microscopy, and mass spectrometry.  Second, the course ?Principles of Experimental Geochemistry?, will be offered as an upper division hybrid lecture- laboratory-based course designed as an active learning ?studio? format. Third, an undergraduate student will conduct laboratory research directly related to the objectives of this proposal, leading to a senior research thesis.  And finally, the PI will design and build a simple petrographic microscope to enable mineral viewing in plane polarized and cross polarized light to develop a simple educational lesson, using the features of this microscope, for 8-12th grade students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

When resources (e.g., time, energy, money, esteem) are threatened or lost, individuals experience stress, and when employees? struggle with managing identity-related threats, team productivity and organizational effectiveness suffer. This project examines the connection between organizational resources and individual resilience. The investigator uncovers the role that organizations play in the employee resilience process and identifies specific organizational resources that are effective at bolstering employee safety and health despite the presence of racial identity threats. Knowledge generated from this award offers insights for organizational science and for workforce diversity and performance.<br/><br/>Experiences that threaten one?s resources contribute to negative organizational outcomes. When threats are tied to an identity (e.g., race), they can lead to inequality and further group disparities. Racial identity threats occur in multiple forms, ranging from environmental (e.g., mega-threats: negative, large-scale, diversity-related episodes that receive significant media attention) to interpersonal (e.g., microaggressions: daily verbal or behavioral indignities that denigrate individuals from racial minority groups). The role that organizations play in supporting employee resilience?continued behavioral and psychological goal pursuit despite adversity?to racial identity threats is unknown. Thus, this project identifies the organizational proactive resources (continually available resources present before a threat, e.g., race-based employee resource groups) and protective resources (resources made available after a threat that are meant to diminish strain responses, e.g., paid therapy) that shape key psychological mechanisms that predict employee resilience: identity safety (i.e., feeling like one?s identity will not evoke harm) and emotional exhaustion (i.e., feelings of being emotionally drained). The investigator qualitatively (Study 1: in-depth, structured interviews) and quantitatively (Study 2: longitudinal, weekly surveys) assesses the role of organizational resources in fostering employee resilience among employees who belong to stigmatized racial groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Network visualization is a particularly powerful and relevant approach for learners to understand. In a network visualization, people, places, and things are the nodes in a network, displayed as circles. These nodes are connected by lines that represent interactions. Learners can view relationships between nodes and lines in a network using either a dynamic visualization or they can view network data as a table. The two different representations together can help learners explore data in many contexts. This exploration is particularly relevant for data about relationships built on popular social media platforms. Therefore, network visualizations present a unique opportunity to explore data and data literacy in rich social contexts that are of interest for, and relevance to, youth learners. As they explore a range of locally relevant contexts across disciplines, learners will be engaged with core data literacy principles. To accomplish this, the project team will design, implement, and study an instructional unit about network visualization using the open-source Net.Create software tool that this team previously created to support intuitive, collaborative network visualization. As part of a co-design process with teachers, the team will create a curriculum unit that encourages 7th and 8th grade students to engage in core network visualization and key data literacy practices that meet disciplinary standards. The curriculum will integrate students? interests and cultural identities, and those of their communities. For example, network visualizations that may be explored include hobbies and activities they are engaged in as well as aspects of their culture or identity.   To help students appreciate network visualization in a robust manner, they will have opportunities to develop, critique, and revise the visualizations they build.<br/><br/>This project will take a synergistic approach in which middle school students use network visualization to learn about themselves and their communities. As the same time, students will also be learning about the underlying network science and data literacy principles that make their exploration possible, and which are central to their experiences with many common technologies. The project addresses three research questions over this three-year study: 1) How can students learn network and data literacy concepts through the creation of network visualizations with their peers? 2) How does exploring their collective identity, through topics of interest to students both individually and as a whole, using network visualization help motivate them to explore data literacy and integrate technology more deeply into their lives and careers? 3) What challenges and opportunities do teachers see in using network visualizations to support teaching data literacy concepts? The project team will engage in iterative co-design with a partner school district to adapt the draft curriculum to be locally relevant and meaningful. The project will also extend the Net.Create tool to support more robust exploration of the data literacy concepts such as data provenance. Data analysis will include pre / post measures of data literacy concepts and criticality, analysis of networks created by learners and computer logs, application of an engagement rubric that measures quality of student engagement with different activities, and interaction analysis of classroom activities to help articulate how learners used the tools to develop understanding of target concepts. The project team will work closely with two teachers in year 1, three teachers in year 2, and five teachers in year 3, while also scaling up the implementation to see how up to 20 additional teachers are subsequently able to implement the curriculum. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

COVID-19 has taken a devastating toll on prison populations across the United States. Incarcerated people have experienced a risk of infection five times higher and risk of death three times higher than people in the general population. Recent national data collection projects lack both demographic information on deaths and facility-level details about the characteristics of places where deaths have been concentrated. Such data collection gaps around prisons leave open questions about both the unequal repercussions of COVID-19 and the mechanisms by which people in some institutions fared better than others. Findings from this project provide the first systematic accounting of the total mortality toll in prisons across the United States?a necessary foundation for future planning for resiliency efforts.<br/><br/>Three research questions are investigated. First, did the risk of facility-level death in prison?from COVID-19, other natural causes, and unnatural causes?during the pandemic (2020-2022) differ significantly from the facility-level risk of death in prisons in prior years (2013-2019)? Second, how are demographic characteristics associated with deaths in prisons, and did these associations differ during the pandemic from prior years? Third, how are state- and facility-level characteristics (including COVID-19 mitigation responses and carceral deprivation) associated with deaths during the pandemic? These questions are addressed by collecting (via state-by-state public records requests) and analyzing monthly facility-level data on all deaths among people in custody of each state Department of Corrections and the Federal Bureau of Prisons between 2013 and 2022. These data are supplemented and verified with 2013 data available through ICPSR, 2014-2019 count data available through the Bureau of Justice Statistics, and 2020-2022 data available through the National Death Index (NDI), vital statistics, and medical examiners? offices.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Examples range from the global level (social networks, economic networks) to the cellular level (immune networks, neuron networks), and can be virtual rather than physical (signal processing, artificial intelligence). Probability theory can analyze these systems by harnessing the predictive power of the aggregate effect of more and more random variables, otherwise known as disorder. To make effective use of this theory, mathematicians and other practitioners must be able to both infer qualitative large-scale structure from more easily measured system statistics and identify the relationship between these statistics and the parameters governing the model. This project will pursue these objectives for two classes of disordered systems: spin glasses and random growth, both of which are of continuing interest in physics, computer science, and engineering. The project will include research training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students and also outreach efforts to elementary and secondary students. <br/><br/>Among the proposed investigations are (1) establishing Parisi-type formulas for the limiting energy of so-called multi-species and vector-spin models, by using techniques from functional analysis and PDEs; (2) determination of the phase diagram of these same models, by performing variational calculus on the obtained Parisi formulas; (3) producing new estimates on the size of fluctuations in growth interfaces associated to first- and last-passage percolation, by adapting tools from stochastic analysis; and (4) studying the phenomenon of quenched localization in directed polymers, by leveraging untapped connections to spin glass theory.

These are expected to take meaningful actions (logical correctness) at the right time (timeliness). Timeliness is crucial in safety-critical autonomous systems such as driverless vehicles and aircraft, manufacturing and power plants, and devices for intensive care and life support. Similarly, quality-of-service in enterprise and cloud systems primarily encompasses the temporal characteristics of application workloads. Unfortunately, the intense push for intelligent systems over the last decade has caused an explosion in the complexity of software and hardware layers. In turn, the sharp rise in system complexity has significantly weakened our ability to reason about, predict, and control the timeliness of application workloads. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project aims to reconcile the critical need for timeliness with the growing complexity of modern intelligent systems with an integrative research and education plan. The research focuses on turning timeliness into a dimension that can be directly and explicitly managed in high-performance platforms. It does so by recognizing the importance of gathering and acting upon precise knowledge about the low-level interplay between software and hardware components. Systemic paradigms to collect, retain, and leverage such knowledge are studied, with a specific focus on practical technology that can be immediately employed on commercial platforms. In a complementary way, the PI has devised educational activities to introduce timeliness as a fundamental design-time dimension in computer science curricula, with a number of outreach activities designed for pre-college students to explore challenges in time-sensitive systems.<br/><br/>Through a coordinated plan to rethink the role of hardware and platform-software components, the PI will lay down the blueprints for knowledge-driven system management with explicit control over timeliness as a goal. Emerging commercial-off-the-shelf platforms that include traditional processing elements and reprogrammable logic provide a unique opportunity to practically instantiate said blueprints. Three orthogonal research thrusts comprise the pillars of this research effort. The first thrust focuses on designing and developing a set of enabling mechanisms to observe and control performance-critical hardware resources with minimal overhead. In particular, observation mechanisms are designed to collect insights into micro-scale application-platform interactions. Conversely, control mechanisms are devised to enforce fine-grained resource provisioning decisions at a micro-architectural level. The second thrust tackles the challenge of extracting knowledge from fine-grained data. This entails contextualizing the acquired data streams to construct a notion of timely application progress. Timely progress information is leveraged to detect past under-/over-provisioning and perform allocation/reclaiming accordingly. Simultaneously, strategies to accurately predict the impact of resource provisioning policies over future application progress are explored. Finally, the third thrust concerns the criticality-aware composition of multiple application workloads with specified timeliness requirements, profiled demand for hardware resources, and known temporal behavior in response to changes in resource provisioning. The significance of this project is threefold. First, direct control over the timeliness of complex applications via knowledge-driven system management provides the necessary principled foundations for data-driven real-time decision-making. Second, the methodologies and techniques developed as part of this effort will serve as a reference for future hardware platforms to achieve control over timeliness by design. Third, cross-cutting activities targeting pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate students at Boston University aim to bring temporal behavior analysis and timeliness into the foreground of computer science education.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Decades of experiments have provided tremendous insights into how plants and animal change shape, but we know much less about ?shape-shifting? species in nature. Understanding how plants and animals evolve the ability to change their traits in different environments is of interest not only to foundational research in biology, but also to real-world applications, including changes in tolerance to pesticides, freshwater salinization, invasive species, wildlife diseases, human health, and climate change. Thus, the insights from this research will provide societal benefits by furthering our understanding of how changes in morphology can evolve. The work will train 3 undergraduate students, involve summer high school and middle school teachers, and K-12 and public outreach efforts (including with underserved schools). <br/><br/>This project will synthesize long-term data on natural environments to better understand how environmental variation impacts the future evolution of species traits. Using discoveries from over three decades of experiments on multiple species of tadpoles, which alter their morphology in different predator and competitor environments, I plan to synthesize that work with nearly two decades of data on environmental variation from long-term surveys of 40 ponds and wetlands in Michigan. The proposal has four major objectives:  1) examine whether the morphological changes observed in our experiments also occur in nature; 2) determine if variation in competition and predation in natural wetlands differs for each tadpole species and is associated with known morphological changes of each species; 3) investigate how different populations experience different amounts of natural variation in competition and predation over time, and 4) predict responses to natural selection in natural ponds by predators and competitors over time to see if it aligns with observations in prior experiments. Integrating these detailed and long-term datasets allows a synthesis that will address important and novel research questions, thereby adding value and new insights for current and future investigators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Novel device readouts of these qubit networks will be manufactured and characterized with potential for integration into conventional and practical photonic circuit architectures. An interdisciplinary team of investigators from chemistry, biological engineering, and electrical engineering will be assembled to pursue this transformative approach towards scalable quantum device fabrication, which will shift how qubit manufacturing can be implemented at scale. The research will enhance US competitiveness in this growing global technology field. Innovative curriculum development related to this research will be pursued at the undergraduate and graduate levels, including mentoring high school students, women, and underrepresented minorities.<br/><br/>Optically-addressable qubits provide a generalizable platform for quantum information science. However, the lack of precise spatial distribution of nanovacancy color-centers into qubit-networks has hindered their translation towards scalable, low-cost device fabrication. Recent progress in chemically-tailorable organometallic spin qubit systems show promise as an alternative, whereby chemical synthesis affords bottom-up qubit design and portability across different environments. However, these organometallic qubits require dilution in a host-matrix co-crystal for solid state implementation, yielding distributed color-center environments and density across a matrix that prevents controlled, scalable qubit-networking. As an alternative, single-molecule addressability of highly programmable DNA assemblies programmed using the principle of DNA origami will be leveraged together with chemically-tailorable organometallic qubits to realize a scalable manufacturing platform for spatially controlled qubits. Distinct organometallic color-centers using these DNA-based scaffolds will enable the integration of qubits into higher-order spatial networks to fabricate multi-qubit systems and devices. 2D DNA architectures will be patterned with nanoscale position and orientation onto device surfaces using programmable shape matching of the DNA structure to lithographically-patterned semiconductor layers.

Many of these species existed long before humans. They evolved to fill critical roles in ecosystems on which humanity relies for food, clean air, clean water, fertile soils, and a host of other services that make life possible and comfortable on this planet. For decades conservation efforts have focused primarily on saving select species. Unfortunately, such approaches do not encompass the bulk of biodiversity or the more complex interactions among species. These approaches leave gaps in scientific understanding of ecosystem level processes and interactions needed to implement effective conservation actions. This is especially evident for high diversity but poorly studied groups like snails, which account for the highest number of recorded extinctions in human history. Hawaiian Island land snails include some of the most diverse groups of snails on the planet. They are also among the most heavily impacted by extinction, with more than half of the more than 750 known species already lost. Saving the remaining species and restoring these jewels of the Hawaiian forests requires knowledge of species interactions and their ecological requirements. Understanding why land snails live where they do, what they feed on, and what their other habitat requirements are is critical to successful captive rearing of the remaining species and to returning them to the wild in protected and restored habitats. In addition, this project will help fill the human resource capacity shortfall by providing conservation experiences and broadening participation of groups underrepresented in science and conservation specifically. Students and researchers will engage and contribute to a broader understanding of ecology, applied conservation, and the biology of lesser-known groups like snails. At a deeper community level, this will expand knowledge and engagement with indigenous practices and ways of understanding. Hawaiian land snails hold deep cultural presence and Hawaiians hold generations of natural history insights about the natural world. This project will help bridge biocultural land snail knowledge with physical objects, natural history data, and genomics. Collectively, this will increase stewardship and sustainability of environmental resources, support conservation management efforts through indigenous value systems, and instill appreciation and protection of our precious resources for generations. <br/><br/>Researchers will incorporate studies in microbial genomics, field ecology, and captive rearing diets that address the most urgent knowledge gaps in Hawaiian land snail ecology. By examining resource preferences and feeding ecology of Hawaiian lands snails this project will 1) determine snail feeding preferences on bacteria and fungi that grow on their native host plants; 2) characterize the microbial communities that likely form key components of snail diets; and 3) identify preferred plants and microbial communities that improve snail survivorship and breeding in captivity. The data gathered will be used to expand captive rearing capacity, restore degraded habitats with preferred plant resources, and build long term capacity for effective land snail conservation in Hawaii. Knowing which microbial assemblages enhance snail survivorship, growth, and fecundity will provide conservationists with a powerful tool to assess quality of snail habitat. It will also enable restoration practitioners to create habitats to support extant populations in the wild.<br/><br/>This project is being supported via a joint program involving the Divisions of Environmental Biology and Integrative Organismal Systems and the Paul G.

Economic theory predicts that workers will earn higher wages when there are many employers offering jobs. However, in some local areas there are only a few employers. In this kind of concentrated labor market, employers have an advantage because workers lack viable alternative offers. Furthermore, if a firm has a dominant position in the market for the product/s it sells, it may also be dominant in the labor market. This kind of firm would then have an outsized role on both its workers and its consumers. The project will systematically investigate how concentration affects wages, employment spell duration, and profit pass-through. The results of this project may help policymakers understand the costs and benefits of policies designed to reduce market concentration. <br/><br/>This project is based on three administrative datasets spanning the years 2008 to 2020. The first is the quasi-universe of employment spells year-by-year; the research team will use this to systematically construct the employment and wage bill concentration indexes. This first dataset lacks the ability to track workers over time for confidentiality reasons. The second dataset is an employer-employee panel with information on wages, duration of spell, industry, occupation and some demographic information. This dataset allows us to follow workers and firms over the years. Finally, the third dataset contains balance sheet information at the firm?s level (sales, profits, inventories, etc.). What makes these datasets unique is the possibility to merge them using a unique firm identifier.  The project builds the concentration index by labor market and merges that measure with our panel data and each firm?s balance sheet. The result is a new panel in which we can look at how wages vary depending on concentrations in the product and labor market. This analysis represents the core of the project. The first step will be to properly define labor markets. We will rely on traditional notions like occupation by commuting zone, in addition to a clustering approach based workers? transitions across firms (applying newly developed techniques in stochastic block modeling). We will then run labor regressions to document patterns between wages (level and growth), concentration and profits and sales. We want to document whether workers in more concentrated markets are better or worse off. As pointed out above, in more concentrated markets, firms are likely to have more bargaining power, yet they should also be more productive firms, and therefore be paying higher wages. These regressions will not inform us on the causality of market concentration on wages though. To alleviate that point, the next step of the project will be to propose a search-and-matching model in which a discrete number of firms compete for workers and use our empirical results to calibrate it. We will then be able to run counterfactual analyses on the impact of concentration on workers? welfare.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate projections indicate that the Arctic will continue to warm, but uncertainties arise due to questions about the future behavior of Arctic clouds.  An area of primary uncertainty is the properties of clouds that form during cold-air outbreaks, where very cold airmasses over the Arctic ice move southward over the relatively warm open ocean.  This award will help to provide observational data of these clouds (and precipitation) and the exchange of energy between the ocean and atmosphere during the Cold-Air outbreak Experiment in the Sub-Arctic Region (CAESAR), which will be conducted in Spring 2024 out of northern Scandinavia.  The observations collected during CAESAR will be used in an effort to better understand the characteristics of the cold-air outbreak system, and the Arctic climate system more broadly, in order to inform climate models and projections.  The project will also help to improve forecasting of weather hazards with significant relevance to naval operations, commercial shipping, and coastal communities.

One way to increase this relevance is with learning experiences that are grounded in community-based questions and inquiries that students identify and carry out themselves. An important contribution of this project is investigating how culturally relevant and community-based science curriculum helps to affirm and develop Black students? science identities in an urban, elementary classroom. This project will partner with third, fourth and fifth-grade elementary teachers  to create and to investigate such learning experiences. The planned partner for the collaboration is a public, charter school in Detroit. The research will document how teachers and students identify and explore science questions that are drawn from their local community context and use the results of their inquiries to enact local community change. The project will develop resources to help teachers create similar experiences for elementary students in their own communities. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to design equitable, culturally relevant and community-centered science learning with Black elementary-aged youth and to understand how the learning experience influences their multiple identities, specifically their disposition toward science. This work uses the youth participatory science model to engage students and teachers in the cycle of community-based scientific inquiry. The youth participatory science model engages students in identifying community-based issues, using scientific inquiry to analyze and understand those issues, and then sharing their findings with the broader community. A significant contribution of the project is the adaptation of this model from secondary science classrooms to elementary school. This research will address the following research questions. First, how does a justice and community-centered science curriculum impact the racial, science, and academic identities of Black elementary students within an urban school? Second, through engaging in identity-affirming science instruction, how do Black elementary students view themselves as active participants within the scientific community?

Kennemur of Florida State University is studying copolymerization thermodynamics of cyclic monomers in ring opening metathesis polymerization (ROMP).  Copolymerization of two or more individual monomers into one macromolecule or polymer offers a divergent means of producing societal plastics that contain distributed functionality for a myriad of applications. Specifically, ROMP affords a variety of industrially relevant polyolefin-based materials through chain growth of strained cycloolefin monomers using well-established catalysts. This Kennemur team will perform systematic synthetic, kinetic and mechanistic studies to gain understanding of how basic thermodynamic principles along with key conditions, such as catalyst and solvent, ultimately dictate the reactivity ratios of various cycloolefin comonomers and their sequencing within the macromolecular chains that are grown. The project will also introduce new biomass-based terpene cycloolefins to provide a thermodynamic spectrum of medium ring-strain not afforded by the commonly employed cycloolefin monomers in ROMP.  The research team will continue engagement with the first ever American Chemical Society Division of Polymer Chemistry and Division of Polymer Materials Science and Engineering student chapter that is co-established between a historically black college/university of Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University (FAMU) and an R1 research university in Florida State University.  This student chapter will bring together a highly diverse body of students and faculty aimed at polymer science research.  This unique platform will additionally be utilized to promote the growth of graduate and undergraduate students towards the development of leadership, both governed by outreach and the development of a new Florida-based conference, centered on polymer science.<br/><br/>This project will focus on elucidating ring opening metathesis copolymerization thermodynamics of monomers with dissimilar ring strain energies. In the first aim, reactivity ratios of low-strain cyclopentene monomers that are highly sensitive to slight variations in their ring strain energy (RSE) will be determined using modern integrated approaches.  Determined parameters will then be correlated to monomer sequencing within the polymer microstructure as a function of thermodynamic principles (monomer concentration, stoichiometry, and temperature).  The second aim will examine, delta-pinene, and its variant, apopinene , which have RSEs that are in-between the high strain and low strain monomers typically employed in ROMP. Fundamental thermodynamic investigations and copolymerizations of these terpene-based monomers with each other and with low/ high RSE monomers will also be explored.  Finally, the last specific aim will push the limits of disparity between RSEs by investigating high strain and low strain monomers in combination. Such investigations have potential for both alternating and blocky sequencing strategies. Taken together, these studies have the potential to provide guiding principles for the rational design of copolymers from readily available cycloolefin monomers; there is the potential to uncover basic principles that will apply to ring-opening polymerization (ROMP), in general, and thereby have a significant long-term scientific impact on polymer chemistry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate projections indicate that the Arctic will continue to warm, but uncertainties arise due to questions about the future behavior of Arctic clouds.  An area of primary uncertainty is the properties of clouds that form during cold-air outbreaks, where very cold airmasses over the Arctic ice move southward over the relatively warm open ocean.  This award will help to provide observational data of these clouds (and precipitation) and the exchange of energy between the ocean and atmosphere during the Cold-Air outbreak Experiment in the Sub-Arctic Region (CAESAR), which will be conducted in Spring 2024 out of northern Scandinavia.  The observations collected during CAESAR will be used in an effort to better understand the characteristics of the cold-air outbreak system, and the Arctic climate system more broadly, in order to inform climate models and projections.  The project will also help to improve forecasting of weather hazards with significant relevance to naval operations, commercial shipping, and coastal communities.  The broader field effort includes significant opportunities for students and early-career scientists, international collaboration, and public outreach.  This award will contribute to the main broader impact goals of the CAESAR campaign.<br/><br/>This project will make use of remote sensing observations of mixed-phase clouds to characterize their partitioning between liquid and ice as a function of the cloud evolution, with an additional step of using CAESAR-constrained large-eddy-scale simulations to understand the processes that determine this partitioning.  The primary addition to the CAESAR campaign from this award is the measurement of cloud liquid water path from a G-band Vapor Radiometer.  The researchers hypothesize that the cold air outbreak clouds produced near the sea ice edge are fully liquid, and transition to liquid cloud overlying ice precipitation further downstream, through interactions with the large-scale environmental parameters (aerosol and dynamical) that are reflected in the cloud morphology.  A counter-hypothesis is that much of the precipitation can also occur as super-cooled drizzle, potentially due to a lack of ice nucleating particles (INPs).<br/><br/>Primary funding for this project comes from the Physical and Dynamic Meteorology program with partial funding from the Arctic Natural Sciences program.

But only a fraction of DNA in the genome?the ?coding DNA??contains biochemical instructions for generating the proteins that perform the vast range of activities essential for life. Indeed, 99% of the human genome is regarded as ?non-coding? DNA. Intriguingly, the DNA in this ?non-coding? part of the genome can still generate RNA, even though these non-coding RNAs are not translated into proteins, in contrast to the ""messenger"" RNAs generated by coding DNA. Surprisingly, the functions of non-coding RNAs, which represent a large percentage of the genome, are still largely unknown. A major goal of the present project is to explore potential roles these non-coding RNAs could play in the encoding of memory. At present, memories are widely thought to be stored as changes in the strengths of connections among neurons in the brain. The project will build on prior evidence that some forms of simple memory may instead be encoded as changes in RNA molecules. The project will examine whether one simple form of memory?behavioral sensitization?can be stored by non-coding RNA, or whether non-coding RNA can produce downstream molecular changes that store memory. In addition, the project will enhance the training of future scientists, including graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Finally, undergraduate and minority students underrepresented in STEM will participate in the proposed research under the mentorship of the principal investigators, and thereby gain a deeper understanding of scientific research.<br/><br/>A previous study by one of the principal investigators (PIs) showed that long-term memory (LTM) can be transferred by injecting RNA from trained animals into untrained animals. In this prior work, RNA was extracted from the nervous systems of sensitized (?trained?) marine snails (Aplysia californica), purified, and then injected into untrained snails; injected RNA from trained animals produced sensitization in untrained animals, whereas RNA from untrained donor animals did not. The PIs hypothesize that the expression or post-transcriptional state of one or more non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is selectively induced by sensitization training and that this molecular change mediates persistent sensitization memory in Aplysia. To test this hypothesis, the PIs will perform differential RNA-seq on purified RNA from trained and untrained animals and identify species of ncRNA with changes that correlate significantly with LTM. Initial experiments will determine whether the expression levels of specific ncRNAs change as a consequence of sensitization. Based on these results, additional aspects of ncRNA structure, modification state or protein interactions will be probed to explore whether sensitization training induces persistent changes in these ncRNA properties that could mediate memory encoding in Aplysia. This work would set the stage for a future project in which candidate ncRNAs be screened for mnemonic potency by disrupting them with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and assessing the effects on neuronal excitability and synaptic connectivity of Aplysia sensory and motor neurons, as well as the effect of the ASOs on LTM in intact animals.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Neural Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This bias has limited the progress of science to advance national health and welfare. In 2016, to encourage inclusion of both males and females in research, the National Institutes of Health implemented a policy requiring the consideration of sex as a biological variable (SABV) in all funded studies. Although inclusion of females in research has improved, sex-based data are often not being analyzed using rigorous approaches. Our preliminary analysis of SABV-compliant studies showed that when authors report sex-specific effects, they tested statistically for such effects only 29% of the time. Instead, claims of sex-specific findings typically rest on assertion alone. Our previous findings indicate clearly that the implementation of SABV has not been rigorous and that the process of peer review of SABV-compliant research needs to improve. False claims of sex differences can lead to the wasting of resources on ?differences? that do not exist, and to inequities in access to effective treatments. Similarly, false claims of non-differences can lead to missed opportunities to provide effective health care for people of all sexes and genders. The intended goals of SABV, namely to enhance reproducibility and to facilitate sex-based precision medicine, are not being met. In this project we will determine the impact of inappropriate analytical approaches on the accurate reporting of sex-specific effects, identify factors that inform decisions about analytical approaches to sex-based data, and disseminate tools for designing and evaluating studies that consider SABV.<br/> <br/>We will use a mixed method approach that includes analyses of published journal articles, interviews with scientists, and outreach. We will conduct a large-scale analysis of the biomedical literature to show how inappropriate statistical approaches to sex-based data are impacting the rigorous implementation of SABV.

As engineering and CS have emerged as priorities in K-12 education, there is a pressing need to increase understanding of the experiences of engineering and CS teachers and factors that influence their retention and effectiveness. Although there is a strong research base on the retention of mathematics and science teachers, little research has examined factors impacting the retention and effectiveness of engineering or CS teachers. The purpose of this research is to investigate how engineering and CS teachers? professional identity and support networks impact their retention and effectiveness in high-need schools. Additionally, the research aims to explore how school or school district-level characteristics might be associated with teachers? professional identity, support networks, effectiveness, and retention. Further, the research aims to understand the influence of teacher education programs on engineering and CS teachers? effectiveness and retention. Ultimately, this work will contribute to our understanding of how best to support and retain effective engineering and CS teachers in high-need K-12 schools. <br/><br/>This project at the Georgia Institute of Technology includes partnerships with the Georgia Department of Education, Georgia College and State University, and Piedmont University. Three project goals guide the work of the principal investigators. First is to analyze state-level engineering and CS teacher mobility, attrition, and effectiveness data. Second is to develop and administer a national survey around professional identity, self-efficacy, support networks, effectiveness, and retention. Third, and finally, is to conduct case studies to develop deep, contextualized understandings of engineering and CS teachers? experiences. Employing a sequential explanatory mixed-methods design, the project will investigate an array of research questions aligned with these three study goals. Research questions include: What factors influence engineering and CS teachers? persistence in high-need schools? What are the relationships among professional identity, self-efficacy, and retention for engineering and CS teachers? And what experiences influence the professional identities, self-efficacy, effectiveness, retention, and persistence of engineering and CS teachers? The broader impacts of this research will be at the national level. Identifying factors that influence engineering and CS teachers? effectiveness and retention, specifically among teachers in high-need schools, has the potential to support teacher education programs in preparing engineering and CS teachers in the future. The project also has the potential to contribute to STEM education literature by generating new insights about the interconnections among teacher professional identity, personal networks, support structures, self-efficacy, teacher effectiveness, and teacher retention. This Track 4: Noyce Research project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

This project will help us understand how glacial instability impacts ecosystems and ocean chemistry, with potential implications for future changes in Greenland and the Canadian Arctic. We will use this project to create educational activities designed to ?bring the polar regions to the Southern and Midwest US.?

It has been suggested that rapid growth of sills or dikes causes gas bubbles in magmas to collapse suddenly, causing cracking of the surrounding rock and volcanic tremors. If this is proven, monitoring these tremors will allow scientists to track dikes in real time as they grow, which will help them forecast the timing and size of eruptions. In this CAREER project, Dr. Roohollah Askari will conduct laboratory experiments to make bubbles in fluid-filled cracks grow and collapse, and he will monitor shaking and crack growth that result, using high-speed photography and other techniques. He will also use mathematical techniques to show that the discoveries from his laboratory experiments apply to sills and dikes under volcanoes, which are of course much larger and made of different materials. Dr. Askari and his team (including teachers) will also produce several educational videos based on the experiments, and he will host college students from Puerto Rico in his laboratory so they can learn experimental techniques along with his own students.<br/><br/>Cracks (sills and dikes) contribute significantly to magma transport, often serving as preferential flow paths. Thus, understanding the dynamics of magmatic crack growth and its induced seismicity is crucial for estimating magma transport, monitoring the development of new cracks, and forecasting upcoming eruptions. Crack dynamics and growth may be affected significantly by bubble-magma interaction caused by cavitation. Although cavitation and bubble nucleation in magma have been studied generally, comparatively little is known about these phenomena in fluid-filled cracks, given the complex interaction between the crack fluid and walls. Shock waves that are strong enough to damage the crack walls, create sub-cracks, and be detected seismically are another possible outcome of cavitation in magmatic cracks. Understanding this process is critical to predicting when sub-dikes or sills can develop from a preexisting dike or sill. In this CAREER project, Askari will develop two analog apparatuses and conduct suites of experiments to decipher 1) the fundamental factors influencing cavitation in fluid-filled cracks, 2) the subsequent sub-crack growth mechanism, and 3) induced seismicity. This project will promote the engagement of students by offering summer research internships for students from the University of Puerto Rico. Instructional videos featuring the experiments and targeting pre-college and college-level students will be developed, assessed, and updated, in collaboration with teachers and education specialists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One of the grand challenges of cyber-physical human systems (CPHS) is how to design autonomous systems where human-system collaboration is optimized through improved understanding of human behavior.  A new frontier within this landscape is afforded by the advent of low-cost, low-power millimeter-wave radio frequency (RF) transceivers, which can be exploited almost anywhere as part of the Internet-of-Things, smart environments, and personal devices.  RF sensors provide a unique, information rich dataset of high-resolution measurements of distance, direction-of-arrival, and micro-Doppler signature in a non-contact, non-intrusive fashion in most weather conditions and in the dark.  This CAREER project aims to pave the way for new and innovative RF-enabled CPHS applications in service of society and a better quality-of-life by transforming current fixed-transmission RF sensors into intelligent devices that can autonomously respond to human and environmental dynamics to optimize CPHS performance.  Due to the burgeoning commercial sector utilizing radar across a variety of fields, such as transportation, health and human-computer interaction, this project features integrated academic preparation for multi-disciplinary, convergence research at both undergraduate and graduate levels to educate a new generation of engineers with experience in RF sensing, machine learning, signal processing and CPHS applications.  Through K-12 outreach activities and recruiting at local historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs), this project will enrich and motivate students to study STEM fields, laying the foundations for a diverse and globally competitive STEM workforce for the future.<br/><br/>This CAREER project simultaneously addresses critical challenges currently limiting effective exploitation of RF sensors in CPHS, such as the problem of RF data scarcity for training deep models, the wide range and continuity of possible human movements, the presence of other people and obstacles, and the dynamic nature of real-world scenes.  Specific contributions include the development of 1) physics-aware ML techniques that leverage the domain knowledge embodied in models with data-driven deep learning; 2) spatio-temporal parsing techniques to extract and recognize human signal components from RF data streams to improve robustness of RF-CPHS under real-world conditions; and 3) a new task-cognizant, fully-adaptive RF sensing framework to improve performance and robustness of RF-CPHS for varying tasks in dynamic real-world environments.  The proposed fully-adaptive RF framework also paves the way for collaborative, multi-modal RF-CPHS by exploiting information learned from RF and other sensor modalities in its decision process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite extensive study, definitive experimental evidence of the conditions at which deformation will and will not transmit across grain boundaries is elusive, particularly at extreme temperatures in conditions found during space travel or hypersonic propulsion. New electron microscopy and X-ray measurements, which can look in detail at and below the sample surface, are being used together to watch how deformation is transmitted across grain boundaries as it occurs. Using these measurements and machine-learning techniques, a set of rules are being established describing how deformation is transmitted as a function of temperature in a range of model atomic crystal structures representing various forms of commonly used structural alloys. These rules can then be used to improve the usage of existing alloys in the field and to design new high-performance alloy systems.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>State-of-the-art in situ characterization techniques are being taken advantage of to learn the temperature-dependence of microstructural conditions governing plastic deformation localization at and near grain boundaries (GBs) in cubic engineering alloys. A complimentary combination of in situ characterization techniques (high-resolution digital image correlation in the scanning electron microscope and synchrotron X-ray-based 3D reconstructions) capable of probing micromechanical response and microstructural state simultaneously are being used to interrogate the high-dimensional space of microstructural configurations that can exist across GBs in model face-centered cubic (FCC) and body-centered cubic (BCC) alloys. Existing machine-learning (ML) tools are also being used to perform automated classification of the large number of microstructural pairings probed during each in situ experiment and learn criteria for predicting the evolution of plastic deformation localization behaviors at GBs with temperature and associated deformation mechanism activation. In this effort, activation of twinning through cryogenic deformation and its effects on GB plastic deformation localization are being used to create a generalized framework with which the effect of activation of other deformation mechanisms, such as climb, cross-slip, and GB sliding, can be evaluated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

An attractive scheme towards quantum-based technologies involves a class of materials called magnetic topological insulators where the conducting electrons can be confined to the edges or surfaces of the sample and flow without resistance. In this project, based on a LEGO design scheme, the research team employs magnetic topological insulators as primary building blocks to construct a number of multilayer heterostructures and explores the emergent quantum phenomena therein. The success of this project will advance knowledge of the interplay between magnetism and topology. Moreover, this research enhances the material efforts at Penn State. This research team actively integrates graduate and undergraduate education into the project, with a particular focus on increasing participation among underrepresented minorities, and also develops outreach activities that target K-12 students and teachers from the State College Area School District.<br/><br/>Technical Abstract<br/><br/>Current research on magnetic topological states focuses on the quantum anomalous Hall state and magnetic Weyl semimetals. The realization of other magnetic topological phases, including axion insulators, the three-dimensional quantum anomalous Hall state, and higher-order magnetic topological insulators, is still limited due to the lack of suitable magnetic material platforms. The goal of this project is to use magnetically doped and undoped topological insulators and normal insulator layers as building blocks to construct multilayer heterostructures as a highly tunable platform for creating and manipulating these magnetic topological states. The physical properties of these magnetic topological insulator multilayer heterostructures are explored by combining advanced experimental probes, such as electrical transport, scanning tunneling microscopy and spectroscopy, and angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy,  with sophisticated theoretical modeling and material simulations. The realization of magnetic topological states in magnetic topological insulator multilayer heterostructures may pave the way for energy-efficient electronic and spintronic devices. This study also provides the scientific foundation in quantum anomalous Hall and axion insulators to achieve transformative electromagnetic applications in quantum information technology.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, ecological restoration is extremely challenging. It requires building partnerships across researchers, conservationists, and managers to co-develop, test, and refine new science-informed solutions that will improve restoration success, lower costs, and increase efficiency. Restoration in coastal systems has historically taken a single-species approach that focuses on reducing environmental stress, avoiding competition, and excluding interactions with other organisms. Previous work by the investigators is challenging this paradigm and has demonstrated that beneficial interactions among and across species are key to organismal and ecosystem resistance to the high physical stress that is common in restoration. Harnessing mutually beneficial, or positive species interactions has the potential to increase restoration yields at little or no extra cost. This project unites non-profit restoration practitioners with scientists to test and systematically incorporate mutually beneficial interactions in large-scale restoration to increase habitat growth, resistance to environmental stress, and re-establish biodiversity. This work will occur in three invaluable coastal ecosystems that have severely declined due to anthropogenic activities and therefore are the target of extensive conservation efforts ? oyster reefs, salt marshes, and seagrass meadows. Results of this work will inform restoration strategies and be integrated into easy to understand training materials (e.g. step-by-step guides and workshops) that will be distributed to interested stakeholders. This work will support and train a number of conservation scientists across the research institutions and other organizations, and provide hands-on training and demonstrative case-studies of new and easy to implement restoration techniques. <br/><br/>Foundation species, such as salt marsh grass, seagrasses, and oysters, are habitat-forming organisms that create locally stable conditions for other organisms. Secondary foundation species (SFS) are habitat-forming organisms that establish after and within a primary foundation species (PFS) that further modify and enhance ecosystem functions and structure. Inclusion of facilitation between co-occurring primary and secondary foundation species in restoration designs has the potential to increase ecosystem regrowth as well as elevate biodiversity of inhabitants and climate resistance. The overarching objective of the proposed research is to work in concert with conservation organizations to test and co-design evidence-based approaches that restore secondary foundation species to increase the growth of primary foundation species and site biodiversity, while enhancing key ecosystem functions (e.g., climate resistance of restored habitats). Specifically, this project will: 1) Test how enhancing previously restored sites with either complementary or similar SFS at both low and high abundances affects PFS growth, local biodiversity, and key ecosystem functions, 2) Co-restore PFS with either complementary or similar SFS at both low and high abundances in a fully-factorial experiment to test for the relative ability to increase PFS growth, local biodiversity, and important ecosystem functions in newly restored systems, and 3) Survey previously restored habitats and reference sites to quantify and correlate SFS abundance and complementarity with changes in PFS abundance, local biodiversity and ecosystem function to test the generality of SFS effects.<br/><br/>This project is being supported via a joint program involving the Divisions of Environmental Biology and Integrative Organismal Systems and the Paul G.

But only a fraction of DNA in the genome?the ?coding DNA??contains biochemical instructions for generating the proteins that perform the vast range of activities essential for life. Indeed, 99% of the human genome is regarded as ?non-coding? DNA. Intriguingly, the DNA in this ?non-coding? part of the genome can still generate RNA, even though these non-coding RNAs are not translated into proteins, in contrast to the ""messenger"" RNAs generated by coding DNA. Surprisingly, the functions of non-coding RNAs, which represent a large percentage of the genome, are still largely unknown. A major goal of the present project is to explore potential roles these non-coding RNAs could play in the encoding of memory. At present, memories are widely thought to be stored as changes in the strengths of connections among neurons in the brain. The project will build on prior evidence that some forms of simple memory may instead be encoded as changes in RNA molecules. The project will examine whether one simple form of memory?behavioral sensitization?can be stored by non-coding RNA, or whether non-coding RNA can produce downstream molecular changes that store memory. In addition, the project will enhance the training of future scientists, including graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Finally, undergraduate and minority students underrepresented in STEM will participate in the proposed research under the mentorship of the principal investigators, and thereby gain a deeper understanding of scientific research.<br/><br/>A previous study by one of the principal investigators (PIs) showed that long-term memory (LTM) can be transferred by injecting RNA from trained animals into untrained animals. In this prior work, RNA was extracted from the nervous systems of sensitized (?trained?) marine snails (Aplysia californica), purified, and then injected into untrained snails; injected RNA from trained animals produced sensitization in untrained animals, whereas RNA from untrained donor animals did not. The PIs hypothesize that the expression or post-transcriptional state of one or more non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is selectively induced by sensitization training and that this molecular change mediates persistent sensitization memory in Aplysia. To test this hypothesis, the PIs will perform differential RNA-seq on purified RNA from trained and untrained animals and identify species of ncRNA with changes that correlate significantly with LTM. Initial experiments will determine whether the expression levels of specific ncRNAs change as a consequence of sensitization. Based on these results, additional aspects of ncRNA structure, modification state or protein interactions will be probed to explore whether sensitization training induces persistent changes in these ncRNA properties that could mediate memory encoding in Aplysia. This work would set the stage for a future project in which candidate ncRNAs be screened for mnemonic potency by disrupting them with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and assessing the effects on neuronal excitability and synaptic connectivity of Aplysia sensory and motor neurons, as well as the effect of the ASOs on LTM in intact animals.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Neural Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Assessing the full scope of these challenges requires going beyond what is physically visible or on the surface of these environments. This is especially the case in coastal and island environments with karst, landscapes in which water forms a distinct topography including caves, sinkholes, and groundwater aquifers. Past and ongoing exploration, scientific study, and conservation work in the coastal karst systems in the US territory of Puerto Rico (PR) illustrate what is at stake with the study and conservation of karst. While 20% of the United States (US) is karst, it is the source of 40% of the American public?s drinking water. In Puerto Rico these values are much higher, given that 37% of the territory is karst. <br/><br/>Drawing from theories and methods in Science and Technology Studies (STS), anthropology, and geography, this collaborative project between West Virginia University and the American Geophysical Union examines the past and current role of mostly non-traditional actors and their volunteer-based organizations dedicated to the exploration, science, and conservation of karst in its varied forms. This knowledge will make an original contribution to the history, present challenges, and future of geology, archaeology, and other kindred sciences focused on critical zones environments in the US. Data will include archival information, interviews, focus groups, and ethnographic field-based visits with participants. This data will be used to generate the spatial and social networks undergirding coastal karst science and conservation efforts mostly carried out by cave explorers, scientists, conservation practitioners and volunteers. The STS-informed Ecologies of Participation Framework will inform this network analysis which aims to operationalize the who, what, and how of participation in ongoing socio-technical and environmental change. Results will be disseminated in both Spanish and English to a broader audience using ArcGIS StoryMaps, an effective web-based and interactive platform.

For instance, a psychological scientist might carefully design a study to compare strict and lenient teaching styles, opening up the possibility that the answer could be unexpected, or even disappointing. Unlike scientists, however, the public learns the answers that have been selected by science journalists and editors, a system that opens the door to distrust. This distrust is apparent in a recent PEW report, which found that only 52% of Americans say that the media do a good job of covering science, a rate that puts the US second-to-last among the 20 countries surveyed. If journalists are more likely to report on sensationalistic findings over those supported by strong evidence, this could damage the dependability of those findings as source of guidance. Further, if journalists are more likely to report findings that reinforce a particular ideology, this could foster polarization and public distrust. The present proposal will test one strategy for improving the trustworthiness of psychological science reporting: journalists could select research based on methods rather than results (results-blind selection). This approach thus shifts the focus to prioritizing sound, rather than sensational, findings. By pursuing concrete strategies for improving the trustworthiness of science journalism, this proposal aligns with the National Science Foundation?s goal to ?increase the public value of scientific activity.? <br/><br/>The idea that results-blind evaluation could reduce bias and improve the quality of featured research is the foundation for the Registered Reports academic article format, first introduced at Cortex in 2013. Previous research shows that Registered Reports are rated higher than the comparison papers on rigorousness and quality, suggesting that results-blind selection may be an effective way to promote quality and replicability. In the present project, we propose three studies. In Study 1, we will recruit 400 journalists and test whether results-blind selection of scientific studies can improve the trustworthiness of reported research. In Study 2, we will recruit 250 participants and test whether results-blind selection of scientific studies can increase public trust in science journalism. Finally, in Study 3 we will re-contact 32 journalists from Study 1 and use group interviews to explore how results-blind selection could be effectively integrated with existing journalistic norms and routines. These findings will inform our understanding of existing mechanisms that rely on results-blind selection ? like Registered Reports ? as well as our understanding of the potential value of this approach to improving the quality the psychological science that gets communicated to the public.<br/><br/>The project is co-funded by the Science of Science: Discovery, Communications, and Impact and the Advancing Informal STEM Learning Programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is important when testing new algorithms that they be coded correctly. Lean is a programming language that can help check whether math proofs are correct.

This project will expand to SciLib, a community-sourced library of proofs across all fields of science and engineering. Others may use these proofs to probe the scientific literature and verify proofs of their own, accelerating the discovery of new theories. Community college outreach activities and recruitment of transfer students for undergraduate research will support a diverse STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics) workforce.

This is the first step toward creating SciLib, an open-source library of proofs in science and engineering, similar to mathlib, Lean's community-sourced mathematics library. A large database of proofs can be used to evaluate large language models (LLMs) for auto-completing proofs (with verification provided by the Lean compiler), translating informal science into formal proofs (and the reverse), and for generating, proving, and explaining new theories. To teach Lean to scientists and engineers, the ATOMS Lab is planning annual training workshops, with engagement measured by members' sustained contributions to SciLib, as well as interactive online games, built in Lean, that introduce theorem proving and the Lean language to non-mathematicians.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This research will develop a deeper understanding of how the fungal pathogen attacks, and guide management strategies for protecting bats against the devastating impact of WNS. Specifically, the research team will interrogate how a fungal pathogen invades skin through the role of the epidermal growth factor receptor in bats, possibly resulting in a broader understanding of such processes in mammals in general. Additionally, the team will attempt a novel approach of combining vaccination with topical drugs that block infection ? with the goals to advance the conservation of several bat species, maintain biodiversity and support ecosystem health. In addition, this project features the training and teaching of early career scientists and wildlife biology trainees and is based on the collaboration of an academic institution and federal agencies ? USGS and USFWS.<br/><br/>The fundamental research associated with this project is to further understand how the fungus Pseudogymnoascus destructans (Pd for short) initiates infection by adhering to bat skin. It is known that Pd makes contact with keratinocytes (e.g. epithelial cells).  This project makes use of a first-of-its-kind keratinocyte cell line from Myotis lucifugus, a bat species that is highly susceptible to WNS. The keratinocyte cell line has provided an ideal model to study how Pd invades bat skin and initiates infection. Preliminary data reveal: (i) the identity of a receptor ? epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) ? that mediates keratinocyte ?stealth? invasion by Pd and (ii) the utility of the FDA approved drug gefitinib that blocks Pd invasion of the cells. Experiments are designed to formally test the role of EGFR in Pd invasion via CRISPR editing of keratinocytes. Because EGFR differs in its structure in susceptible and resistant bats, EGFR from resistant bats will be used to complement the knockout cell line to assess the role of EGFR in explaining WNS susceptibility. Conservation biology is an important aspect of the work. WNS prevention strategies will be implemented in collaboration with the U.S. Geological Survey at the National Wildlife Health Center in partnership with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service. Field studies will thus be performed in several U.S. states to investigate the use of gefitinib together with a protective vaccine created by these investigators against Pd infection.<br/><br/>This project is being supported via a joint program involving the Divisions of Environmental Biology and Integrative Organismal Systems and the Paul G.

Climate projections indicate that the Arctic will continue to warm, but uncertainties arise due to questions about the future behavior of Arctic clouds.  An area of primary uncertainty is the properties of clouds that form during cold-air outbreaks, where very cold airmasses over the Arctic ice move southward over the relatively warm open ocean.  This award will help to provide observational data of these clouds (and precipitation) and the exchange of energy between the ocean and atmosphere during the Cold-Air outbreak Experiment in the Sub-Arctic Region (CAESAR), which will be conducted in Spring 2024 out of northern Scandinavia.  The observations collected during CAESAR will be used in an effort to better understand the characteristics of the cold-air outbreak system, and the Arctic climate system more broadly, in order to inform climate models and projections.  The project will also help to improve forecasting of weather hazards with significant relevance to naval operations, commercial shipping, and coastal communities.  The broader field effort includes significant opportunities for students and early-career scientists, international collaboration, and public outreach.  A key addition from this project is in the inclusion of early-career researchers in the role of flight scientist, providing them with an valuable training opportunity.   <br/><br/>This award will seek to constrain primary ice nucleating particle (INP) sources and concentrations associated with cold air outbreak (CAO) cloud systems, thereby supporting the understanding of the evolution of microphysical processes and their description in collaborative cloud modeling simulations.  Data will be used to answer questions about the source of the INP, the primary nucleation mode, and how glaciation occurs.  Real-time INP measurements will be made using the Colorado St. Univ. (CSU) Continuous Flow Diffusion Chamber (CFDC) augmented with an MSP-4240 aerosol concentrator.  In addition, filter samples will be collected for offline measurements of immersion freezing INP concentrations with the CSU ice spectrometer.    <br/><br/>Primary funding for this project comes from the Physical and Dynamic Meteorology program with partial funding from the Arctic Natural Sciences program.

This project will help us understand how glacial instability impacts ecosystems and ocean chemistry, with potential implications for future changes in Greenland and the Canadian Arctic. We will use this project to create educational activities designed to ?bring the polar regions to the Southern and Midwest US.? Teaching about Arctic change provides a unique chance to teach students and the general public about the impacts of human-caused climate change.

The sedimentary record from locations on the Yermak Plateau and Barents Sea slope documents significant perturbations to carbon and nutrient cycles including multiple abrupt sediment delivery events with distinct geochemical and sedimentological compositions. We will determine the source and impact of these sediment events to evaluate how marine carbon and nutrient cycles are perturbed by glacial retreat and instability. This project will use clay mineralogy and geochemical (radiogenic isotopes) techniques to reconstruct the changing sources of sediments through time. We will compare these results with geochemical records of carbon and nutrient cycling to determine the impacts of  a changing sediment source.

While techniques do exist to ensure such isolation, they typically increase the engineering burden on programmers or trade off performance for security, limiting their effectiveness and reach. Today, programmers are deploying code on shared computing infrastructure in increasingly fine-grained units (e.g., serverless computing), making this trade off more severe over time. The off-the-shelf technologies, such as containers that isolation frameworks are often built on, were not designed for this fine-grained use case. This project thus aims to ensure both performance and security for code running on cloud infrastructure by designing new isolation mechanisms from the ground up using novel operating system, compiler, programming language, and virtualization technologies. The project will help produce more robust cloud computing infrastructure that is less susceptible to attack, less likely to leak sensitive user data, and more productive for programmers. If successful, potential impacts include reduced economic losses from compromised infrastructure, strengthened national security, and increased privacy for the broader public using cloud services. The project will also make contributions in education and broadening participation in the computing profession by enhancing educational content, injecting industry-relevant and applied content into the curriculum, increasing the representation of people from diverse backgrounds in computer systems research, revitalizing the computer systems curriculum at the PI?s institution, and fostering undergraduate research engagement. <br/><br/>This project proposes Colony, a new software framework for lightweight, bespoke, virtualized execution contexts. Colony leverages novel execution abstractions customized for individual applications and designed for both performance and isolation. Colony contexts are synthesized using compiler analyses, and are exposed through a rich set of programming abstractions and programming language extensions. Colony builds on a new abstraction for isolated function execution, the virtualized subroutine, or virtine, along with an embeddable hypervisor. The goal of the Colony project is to achieve both high performance and strong isolation for individually isolated function contexts in a variety of applications. The project will explore various mechanisms to enable bespoke contexts, including virtualization mechanisms enhanced for optimized start-up performance, and programming models with novel language/compiler support. These bespoke contexts can be used for lighter-weight isolation than managed languages, giving them broad applicability to areas such as OS kernel drivers, third-party libraries, and database user-defined functions, as well as the more nascent serverless computing paradigm. The proposed work has potential to open up new lines of research in operating systems, virtualization, compilers, and system security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite extensive study, definitive experimental evidence of the conditions at which deformation will and will not transmit across grain boundaries is elusive, particularly at extreme temperatures in conditions found during space travel or hypersonic propulsion. New electron microscopy and X-ray measurements, which can look in detail at and below the sample surface, are being used together to watch how deformation is transmitted across grain boundaries as it occurs. Using these measurements and machine-learning techniques, a set of rules are being established describing how deformation is transmitted as a function of temperature in a range of model atomic crystal structures representing various forms of commonly used structural alloys. These rules can then be used to improve the usage of existing alloys in the field and to design new high-performance alloy systems.<br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY:<br/><br/>State-of-the-art in situ characterization techniques are being taken advantage of to learn the temperature-dependence of microstructural conditions governing plastic deformation localization at and near grain boundaries (GBs) in cubic engineering alloys. A complimentary combination of in situ characterization techniques (high-resolution digital image correlation in the scanning electron microscope and synchrotron X-ray-based 3D reconstructions) capable of probing micromechanical response and microstructural state simultaneously are being used to interrogate the high-dimensional space of microstructural configurations that can exist across GBs in model face-centered cubic (FCC) and body-centered cubic (BCC) alloys. Existing machine-learning (ML) tools are also being used to perform automated classification of the large number of microstructural pairings probed during each in situ experiment and learn criteria for predicting the evolution of plastic deformation localization behaviors at GBs with temperature and associated deformation mechanism activation. In this effort, activation of twinning through cryogenic deformation and its effects on GB plastic deformation localization are being used to create a generalized framework with which the effect of activation of other deformation mechanisms, such as climb, cross-slip, and GB sliding, can be evaluated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Researchers have extensively (but largely independently) studied human decision making and movement control so that their joint influence remains poorly understood. This CAREER award uses computational modeling, neurophysiological recording, and behavioral methods to address the real-time interplay between the evolving decision-making process and movement control during human reaching. Many neurological disorders such as stroke and Parkinson?s disease involve both motor and cognitive deficits. This research program aims to uncover the mechanisms that underpin the interplay between movement and decision making, paving the way for targeted, patient-specific neurorehabilitation of motor and cognitive deficits. The long-term goal is to create sustainable and reciprocal pipelines between research, education, and community outreach by focusing on the interplay between decision making and movement control. The investigator has a strong commitment to diversity and provides training opportunities underrepresented minorities and women undergraduate and graduate students. Open-access educational games and interactive programs will be developed and made freely available to grade-school and high-school students, with the aim of raising awareness about neurological disorders and inspiring a new and diverse generation of STEM scientists and industry leaders.<br/><br/>The investigators merge computational models from optimal feedback control and decision sciences to understand how goal-related evidence influences the online control of movement. The subject's movements provide a real-time measure of the evolving decision-making process in order to assess 1) how rapid visuomotor feedback loops integrate and express both goal-related evidence and potential energetic cost and 2) whether reward boosts the need to modulate movement vigor and the efficacy of visuomotor feedback during decision making.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by The Perception, Action, and Cognition (PAC) Program, the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR), and the Decision, Risk, and Management Sciences (DRMS) Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will provide two-year scholarships and academic and co-curricular support to twenty-eight (28) talented undergraduate STEM students who are majoring in biology, chemistry, earth sciences, or mathematics and intend to become secondary STEM teachers. An important direction of the project will be to provide teacher preparation and induction that emphasize effective STEM discipline content knowledge along with culturally responsive and place based pedagogical practices to engage diverse student populations in successful learning experiences in STEM. An underlying feature of the project will be the development and implementation of myriad networking opportunities. Included will be the creation of a professional learning community (PLC) composed of university faculty, Noyce Scholars, and STEM teachers at the partnering Local Education Agencies (LEAs). Related to this learning community, other project components will include a seminar series, an annual STEM teaching conference, classroom observations, mentoring of Scholars by college faculty and in-service teachers, and establishment of an online hub for sharing resources and collaboration. The teacher preparation project initiatives coupled with induction and an emphasis on culturally responsive education will develop STEM teachers who will enable high-need schools in New Jersey and other areas across the United States to provide their students a strong and inclusive science and mathematics education. In turn, this will help provide a pathway for many of these same students to establish STEM careers.<br/><br/>This project is housed at Kean University, a minority serving and Hispanic serving institution, and leverages partnerships with two high-need urban adjacent LEAs in New Jersey, namely the Township of Union School District and the Lakewood Township School District. The project will be guided by several goals. First, over five years, the project will recruit, provide scholarships, and prepare a diverse set of twenty-eight (28) high-quality students, who are undergraduate majors in biology, chemistry, earth sciences, or mathematics, to become STEM secondary teachers in high-need schools. A corollary of this goal is that 50% of the Scholars will be students who identify as members of racial and ethnic groups that are underrepresented in their participation in STEM disciplines. A second goal is to provide a variety of networking activities for the project's Scholars to enhance STEM teacher preparation, retention, and classroom effectiveness. An underlying thread through the activities will be an emphasis on culturally responsive pedagogies. For a third goal, the project will provide Noyce Scholars with strong STEM and pedagogical content knowledge through STEM discipline coursework and projects as well as the project's teacher preparation and induction components. Comprehensive mixed-methods project evaluation will provide formative and summative assessment and feedback and generate new knowledge with respect to best practices for professional learning communities and networking opportunities in general for STEM teacher preparation and induction. Project investigators will disseminate findings, successes, and challenges through social media, publications, conference and workshop presentations, summer outreach activities, exchanges with area K-12 educators, and the project's online Culturally Responsive Education for STEM Teachers Hub. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

But only a fraction of DNA in the genome?the ?coding DNA??contains biochemical instructions for generating the proteins that perform the vast range of activities essential for life. Indeed, 99% of the human genome is regarded as ?non-coding? DNA. Intriguingly, the DNA in this ?non-coding? part of the genome can still generate RNA, even though these non-coding RNAs are not translated into proteins, in contrast to the ""messenger"" RNAs generated by coding DNA. Surprisingly, the functions of non-coding RNAs, which represent a large percentage of the genome, are still largely unknown. A major goal of the present project is to explore potential roles these non-coding RNAs could play in the encoding of memory. At present, memories are widely thought to be stored as changes in the strengths of connections among neurons in the brain. The project will build on prior evidence that some forms of simple memory may instead be encoded as changes in RNA molecules. The project will examine whether one simple form of memory?behavioral sensitization?can be stored by non-coding RNA, or whether non-coding RNA can produce downstream molecular changes that store memory. In addition, the project will enhance the training of future scientists, including graduate students and postdoctoral researchers. Finally, undergraduate and minority students underrepresented in STEM will participate in the proposed research under the mentorship of the principal investigators, and thereby gain a deeper understanding of scientific research.<br/><br/>A previous study by one of the principal investigators (PIs) showed that long-term memory (LTM) can be transferred by injecting RNA from trained animals into untrained animals. In this prior work, RNA was extracted from the nervous systems of sensitized (?trained?) marine snails (Aplysia californica), purified, and then injected into untrained snails; injected RNA from trained animals produced sensitization in untrained animals, whereas RNA from untrained donor animals did not. The PIs hypothesize that the expression or post-transcriptional state of one or more non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) is selectively induced by sensitization training and that this molecular change mediates persistent sensitization memory in Aplysia. To test this hypothesis, the PIs will perform differential RNA-seq on purified RNA from trained and untrained animals and identify species of ncRNA with changes that correlate significantly with LTM. Initial experiments will determine whether the expression levels of specific ncRNAs change as a consequence of sensitization. Based on these results, additional aspects of ncRNA structure, modification state or protein interactions will be probed to explore whether sensitization training induces persistent changes in these ncRNA properties that could mediate memory encoding in Aplysia. This work would set the stage for a future project in which candidate ncRNAs be screened for mnemonic potency by disrupting them with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and assessing the effects on neuronal excitability and synaptic connectivity of Aplysia sensory and motor neurons, as well as the effect of the ASOs on LTM in intact animals.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Neural Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent development of single-cell Hi-C (scHi-C) technologies allows researchers to delineate the genome-wide chromatin interactions in individual cells and answer fundamental biological questions. However, computational methods for analyzing scHi-C data are largely lagging behind because of data sparsity, high diversity and complicated hierarchy of chromosomal organization. This project will address these challenges by building a suite of models and parallel tools for both experimental and computational biologists to analyze sparse and large scHi-C datasets, which will help them understand 3D chromatin interactions and gain deep insights into functional outcomes. The saturation model produced by this project will lead to a major improvement in experimental quality, enhanced data analysis, and reduced experimental costs. The integrated research and educational activities include diverse students training and curriculum development for both undergraduate and graduate courses in interdisciplinary subjects spanning computer science, statistics, bioinformatics and biology. <br/><br/>The objectives of this project are to study the cell-specific chromatin organization at different scales by using stochastic theory, wavelet transform, and parallel-computing techniques. First, a stochastic model will be established to understand the saturation status of scHi-C data by evaluating the major protocol steps and sequencing depth. Second, multiscale-based methods will be designed for detecting topologically associated domains and protein-mediated loops, cell clustering, and comparative analysis. Third, all models and tools will be fully parallelized for processing large datasets. The high performance and running speed of these methods will help researchers achieve biological discoveries in a one-stop service, and save time and money for experiments and computational analysis.

However, constructing a behavioral model at design time that offers resiliency for all kinds of attacks and failures is notoriously difficult. There is currently a shortage of inexpensive, automated software that can effectively repair an initial design, and a model-based system developer regularly needs to redesign and reimplement a system from scratch. The project is developing a methodology, along with an associated framework, to assist a designer in repairing an original CPS model so that it continues to satisfy the correctness requirements under modified assumptions. The project?s novelties are as follows. (1) It provides a fresh approach with an end-to-end design and implementation of a software to facilitate model-based repair for improving the resiliency of CPS against unanticipated attacks and failures. (2) It enables a designer to specify resiliency patterns; the investigator is designing an extensible model transformation language for CPS models. (3) The methodology utilizes formal analysis with respect to correctness requirements formalized in signal temporal logic hyper-properties (HyperSTL) at multiple stages. (4) Software tools are being applied on proof-of-concept case studies where the CPS models can be repaired to mitigate practical attacks. The project?s impacts are in (1) developing new technologies and state-of-the-art software tools to enforce the safety, reliability, security, and resiliency of CPS and (2) strengthening mentorship, skill-building, and workforce readiness for CPS engineering in the Southwest Ohio region and nationally.<br/><br/>The proposed framework involves the design, implementation, evaluation, and integration of two main tools: a Model Transformation and a Model Analyzer. A Model Transformation tool consistently incorporates an original state-machine-based model, a collection of resiliency patterns (or potential edits), and feedback from analyzers to produce an updated resilient behavioral model. The tool automatically searches through the extensible library of resiliency patterns, written as model transformation scripts, to solve the model repair problem. A Model Analyzer tool analyzes the system correctness requirements at multiple stages, both at design time and during runtime operation. The complete model generated by the Model Transformation is falsified using a static falsifier, while the corresponding implementation is monitored for violations using a runtime monitor tool. To ensure a rich set of specifications, the investigator is utilizing objectives and safety constraints specified via HyperSTL. An additional feature is a counter-example analyzer that produces feedback to a designer for developing new resiliency patterns. Design and implementation of the tool-chain requires theoretical advances in terms of rigorous formalization, computational engines, and heuristics for scalability. The algorithms for model repair, resiliency patterns, and formal analysis developed in this project are contributions of significant interest to the research community in design and analysis of CPS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This work would set the stage for a future project in which candidate ncRNAs be screened for mnemonic potency by disrupting them with antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) and assessing the effects on neuronal excitability and synaptic connectivity of Aplysia sensory and motor neurons, as well as the effect of the ASOs on LTM in intact animals.<br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Neural Systems Cluster in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For contemporary computer systems, this trend has signified a paradigm shift from computation-centric to communication-centric design methodologies. Consequently, enhancing security, reliability, performance, and energy efficiency of Network-on-Chips (NoCs) architectures is proving to be one of the most critical design challenges to realizing the performance potential of future parallel systems. Despite existing NoC research having made significant progress addressing individual design objectives, relatively few efforts to date have targeted all four challenges in a holistic manner due to the existence of design trade-offs and the complexity of dynamic interactions among various NoC hardware. For example, deploying per-router error correction circuit can lead to excessive delays and increased power consumption while recovering from the fault. Additionally, utilizing regional routing methods for security purposes may result in network hotspots and congestion that greatly hinder performance and lead to faults. Therefore, there is an imminent need for an optimized NoC design that manages the dynamic interactions and handles design trade-offs.<br/><br/>This project devotes to developing a holistic design methodology that addresses the security and reliability of the entire NoC, while maximizing performance and energy efficiency. To achieve this, the project first carries out a thorough study of NoC fault mechanisms and security vulnerabilities. A variety of security-enhancing and fault-tolerant techniques are developed and investigated in order to assess their performance and overheads. Second, it develops a comprehensive and flexible NoC design framework that integrates multiple reconfigurable hardware with embedded NoC enhancement techniques to protect the NoC from transient and permanent faults and security vulnerabilities while meeting power and performance requirements. The designed framework incorporates a learning-enabled controller that deploys machine learning algorithms, such as supervised learning and reinforcement learning, to accurately capture the runtime behaviors of NoCs, model dynamic interactions, and handle trade-offs by automatically deploying the most suitable configurations of the dynamic hardware with the goal of maximizing system-level security, reliability, power, and performance. Finally, the project develops a cycle-accurate simulation tool and an FPGA prototype to evaluate the designed NoC framework. The holistic design approach, covering the NoC architecture designs and the machine learning techniques, will benefit future multicore architectures with improvements in security, dependability, energy efficiency, and performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For a wide variety of complex fluids, such as polymer solutions, emulsions, etc., constitutive models are available that relate the stress in the material to the strain and rate of strain characteristic of the materials deformation and flow. However, the results of numerical simulations are rarely compared quantitatively with details of experiments. As a consequence, in spite of many decades of research, the simulation toolbox has been verified, i.e., the numerical computer codes solve the equations assumed to describe the materials, but the methodology has not been validated, i.e., the solutions to the equations for the material behavior do not generally reproduce the experimental observations made in channel flows, which thus requires new understanding to identify appropriate equations.  The proposed research aims to provide a validation pipeline using a common macroscopic description for dilute polymer solutions but now incorporating different microstructural features of polymers. In particular, the pressure drop versus flow rate relation in non-uniform channel shapes will be studied through a combination of theory, simulations, and experiments. The outreach efforts characterize the PI?s approaches to engaging with, teaching, and mentoring future research scientists, including continuing an annual ?holiday? science lecture that has been delivered since 2002.<br/><br/>There is no shortage of examples of the flow of complex fluids in natural environments, e.g., mucus, swimming cells in polymer-laden aqueous fluids, emulsions used for home and personal care, and industrial applications, e.g., polymer processing. There is also no shortage of developments in the numerical simulation of viscoelastic flows using well-established constitutive equations, most of which have parameters representing various physical effects. Nevertheless, even reasonably well-characterized fluids, such as polymer solutions, produce results, e.g., pressure drop versus flow rate in a non-uniform channel, that are not well-predicted by well-known continuum-level numerical simulations. The proposed research program will address this discrepancy by utilizing the framework of the extended Oldroyd-B description of dilute polymer solutions, including microstructurally inspired terms for finite polymer extensibility (FENE), conformation-dependent drag as the microstructure is elongated, and relative strain/rotation of the microstructure relative to the fluid. Theory, simulations, and experiments will be integrated to study the pressure drop versus flow rate relation in non-uniform channel shapes, while also characterizing the conformation of the microstructure. The PI has a significant track record in the broader impacts of research activities, including publishing in leading journals in engineering and physics, linking fundamental research to applications, hosting visitors from different disciplines and educational institutions, leading professional development activities for undergraduate, graduate, and postdoctoral colleagues, and encouraging participation of young researchers from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will use culturally relevant practices and academic supports to increase the graduation of secondary STEM teachers, including Hispanic and neurodiverse teachers, to serve in high-need districts. Innovative hackathons will involve students in ?hacking? solutions to issues faced by early career teachers, building collaborative and problem-solving skills as well as a STEM educator community. Conference attendance and summer STEM experiences will also enrich student development. The project will continue to support graduates as they gain experience in the classroom and help to build and maintain a community network of STEM teachers. The project has the potential to increase and diversify students pursuing and succeeding in STEM teacher certification, particularly students from culturally and linguistically diverse backgrounds and those who are neurodiverse.<br/><br/>This Aurora University project includes partnerships with two high-need school districts, West Aurora and East Aurora, and Elgin Community College, a two-year Hispanic serving institution. The project will recruit 24 undergraduates in biology, chemistry, and math majors over five years, using culturally relevant lesson plans and academic supports to build success in early STEM courses and broaden the capacity of all students to increase secondary STEM licensure. The project uses a theoretical framework of intersectionality to help identify and support student needs, and to teach prospective teachers to do so in their future classrooms. Project goals include 1) increasing enrollment, retention, and graduation in STEM secondary education, 2) increasing awareness of STEM secondary education careers; 3) Decreasing drop/ fail/ withdrawal rates among STEM majors using STEM content supports, tutoring, and faculty interventions; and 4) Monitoring and mentoring new STEM teachers using an online resource hub, mentoring, and hackathons. The project team will generate knowledge on the impact of intersectionality among STEM teaching students and of encouragement, supports, and intersectionality on neurodivergent students pursuing STEM teaching. The project evaluator will review activities and collect and synthesize data to evaluate success meeting goals and objectives and conduct interviews and surveys to determine the effectiveness of participants as teachers in high-needs schools and Hispanic populations.

The annual Georgia Topology Conference has been an important event for the topological community ever since the first such conference was held in 1961. The focus of the 2023 conference will be the study of spaces of diffeomorphisms, symplectomorphisms and contactomorphisms in dimensions three and four. The 2024 edition will focus on surfaces in smooth 4-dimensional space. In both settings, we are interested in studying the properties of spaces which locally look like the space, or space-time, that we live in, and in which we can combine the tools of calculus with combinatorial and diagrammatic tools. In the first case, we study these spaces by thinking about their symmetries, and in the second case we study these spaces by thinking about how simpler objects (surfaces) sit inside the spaces. These are both hot topics that have seen some dramatic recent results and the purpose of the conferences is to bring advanced and beginning researchers together to learn about the details of recent results, to understand the next questions that need to be solved, and to kick start collaborations to address these questions.<br/><br/>The 2023 conference will focus on spaces of diffeomorphisms, symplectomorphisms and contactomorphisms in dimensions 3 and 4, and will be co-organized by co-PIs David Gay, Gordana Matic, Akram Alishahi and Michael Usher, with help from UGA postdocs Eduardo Fernandez Fuertes, Feride Ceren Kose and Lev Tovstopyat-Nelip. Much work in 4-dimensional topology has focused on classifying and distinguishing the objects, namely 4-manifolds, but an equally important project is to classify and distinguish the {morphisms, namely diffeomorphisms between 4-manifolds. To illustrate how little we know in the smooth setting, until very recently we had no idea whether the group of diffeomorphisms of the 4-ball which are the identity on the boundary was contractible. In a dramatic development, Watanabe showed in 2018 that this group is not contractible by showing that certain homotopy groups were nontrivial (thus disproving the smooth 4-dimensional Smale conjecture) but we still do not know if this group is even path connected. Given the importance of symplectic structures in dimension 4, it is interesting to compare this to Gromov's result that the space of symplectomorphisms of the 4-ball is contractible, along with similar results for contactomorphisms in dimension 3. The 2024 conference will focus on the smooth topology of surfaces embedded in 4-manifolds as a probe into smooth 4-dimensional topology in general. Numerous foundational open problems exist, such as the question of whether a smoothly embedded 2-sphere in the 4-sphere whose complement has cyclic fundamental group bounds a smoothly embedded 3-ball. At the same time there have been dramatic developments recently, such as Gabai's proof of the 4-dimensional lightbulb theorem, that in certain situations completely classifies smooth 2-spheres up to smooth isotopy in the presence of dual spheres. This is a very active area of study with contributions combining tools from gauge theory, Khovanov homology, higher dimensional Morse theory and explicit 4-dimensional visualization.

Researchers and policymakers now recognize that this way of life ? known as pastoralism ? is highly dynamic and flexible, and therefore enables people to thrive when climate change threatens food security and, by extension, creates social or political instability. In Africa, pastoralism has been a mainstay of life for at least seven millennia. Yet archaeologists lack basic data with which to understand how pastoralism developed, expanded across the continent, and changed over time. This limits the extent to which archaeologists can use data from the past to inform present-day discussions of land use and pastoralist resilience. In particular, a key missing element of archaeological research is the plant component of pastoralism food systems. While it is known that pastoralists commonly incorporate crops and wild plants into their food systems today, past pastoralist plant use in Africa is poorly known, due to relatively poor preservation, and a lack of research in this area. This three-year, multidisciplinary research project tackles this research gap with fieldwork and associated laboratory work. The project includes training for undergraduate and graduate students. Results will be made available to a broader public via a US-based archaeological open access database.<br/><br/>An international team of researchers investigates the roles of plants in ancient pastoralist foodways by focusing on a single location with exceptionally good preservation and a three thousand year history. Preliminary evidence for the culinary importance of plants includes plant traces detected in pottery and on grinding stones. In order to holistically reconstruct past food systems, this project supports excavation and study of ancient plant and animal remains informed by an ethnobotanical study. The latter includes interviews with pastoralist and farmer communities on plant identifications and traditional uses; collection of modern plant samples for comparison to and improved identification of ancient remains; and the development of an ethnobotanical database that pairs physical plant samples with text, audio, and video data on traditional plant knowledge and use. Broader impacts of this research also includes the creation of a permanent botanical research collection in two international locations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Concerningly, the observational record indicates that the ocean is losing its oxygen content. State-of-the-art climate models predict this trend will continue through the end of the 21st century. Rates and cause of the oxygen loss are highly uncertain due to sparse data coverage. In recent years, we have learned greatly about the ocean?s salinity and temperature changes from measurements made by the fleet of profiling floats of the Argo program. To date, most of these floats have not measured oxygen. Proposed expansions of the Biogeochemical (operating over the upper 2000 m) and Deep (4000 to 6000 m) components of the Argo program will address this deficit in oxygen measurements. This project will devise an effective sampling protocol for observing ocean oxygen over the full ocean depth. <br/> <br/>This project will use existing oxygen observations and state-of-the-art numerical tools to provide the first design of a feasible and effective oxygen sampling strategy.

At the same time, this work will account for the accuracy and stability of oxygen measuring instruments. Numerical models will be used to determine how historical and additional oxygen data can reduce the uncertainty in understanding of ongoing ocean oxygen loss. Through the course of the project, the researchers will lead several events and create teaching materials to engage the next generation of ocean scientists. They will communicate the importance of ocean oxygen loss, the influence of climate change, and the opportunity to better protect ecosystems through improved oxygen monitoring.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A substantial portion of the RNAs produced by eukaryotic genomes can be classified as lncRNAs, which have little or no potential to encode for protein. LncRNAs are essential across kingdoms of life owing to critical roles in gene regulation. However, progress in the field has been stifled by a lack of computational tools to identify meaningful similarity between lncRNAs. Unlike protein-coding genes, lncRNAs are not constrained by codon usage, evolve rapidly, and achieve function by employing structures or proteins in ways that are not well-understood. Thus, lncRNAs with similar functions often lack any semblance of linear sequence similarity, yet owing to a lack of other options, linear alignment remains the predominant approach for sequence comparison in the lncRNA field. As a result, studies of one lncRNA rarely inform the understanding of others, and among the thousands of unstudied lncRNAs, it is nearly impossible to computationally identify those that encode meaningful functions. However, prior research has demonstrated the proof-of-principle that when compared to linear alignment, non-linear forms of sequence comparisons can provide exponentially more information about the biological properties of lncRNAs, including a modest ability to infer molecular function. In this project, researchers will develop and validate software that will enable any biologists, regardless of computational expertise, to perform quantitative, non-linear sequence comparisons from essentially any computing resource, including a personal laptop. In concert with the development and validation of the new software, the project will provide high-quality mentored research experiences and sustained career guidance for undergraduate students hailing from underrepresented or underprivileged backgrounds, thereby encouraging their entry into science and promoting equity, diversity, and overall excellence in computational biology. <br/><br/>The investigative team recently developed an approach called SEEKR (sequence evaluation through k-mer representation), which compares sequences by their relative abundance of substrings called k-mers. SEEKR provided some of the first evidence that lncRNAs with analogous functions can harbor similarities that are invisible by conventional forms of linear sequence alignment. Despite this success, SEEKR remains limited in its utility. Most notably, it is unable to identify regional similarity between lncRNAs, and has no means to consider local nucleotide context in similarity evaluations, each of which are essential components of lncRNA functionality. Moreover, SEEKR is qualitative and provides end-users with no ability to assess significance of its similarity scores, a critical component of all broadly-used sequence comparison tools. Thus, while SEEKR was an important proof-of-principle, it falls well short of the reliable and broadly applicable tool that the field needs to identify meaningful non-linear similarity between lncRNAs. To address these shortcomings and provide biologists with better tools to identify relationships between sequence and function in lncRNAs, this research will apply a statistical approach called the hidden Markov model (HMM) to develop a python-based software package, hmmSEEKR, that would give biologists the ability to identify regional and whole-transcript similarities in k-mer content between any set of lncRNAs. An early version of hmmSEEKR enabled the identification of known protein-binding domains and functionally characterized lncRNAs from within the mammalian transcriptome, feats that to the knowledge of the investigative team, have not previously been achieved, including using SEEKR. hmmSEEKR will be rigorously validated and tuned by identifying commonalities in protein-binding profiles between a set of known lncRNA functional domains and other lncRNA-like domains from within the transcriptome. Findings will be published in open access journals, including recommendations for default parameters, and a vetted version of hmmSEEKR will be deposited in GitHub and the Python Package Index. A usage manual and links to results will also be posted on https://www.med.unc.edu/pharm/calabreselab/seekr/.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the conclusion of the workshop, participants should have the knowledge and demonstrated skills to be productive members of the CHESS user community.<br/><br/>To provide the students the dedicated focus and attention of CHESS scientists, the HEXT-2023 workshop will be held on May 15 ? 17, 2023. By hosting the workshop without the conflict of another event, CHESS scientists will be able to provide uninterrupted mentorship to the students. To recruit the students for the HEXT-2023 workshop, institutions in the PREM, PREP, and PREC programs will be contacted, and the PIs/Directors of the programs will be encouraged to nominate two students each to attend the workshop. Announcements will be made on the CHESS web sites and email lists as well as the Cornell events web site.  In case of sufficient interest from the community, the meeting presentations will be simulcast over the internet using standard transmission modes for participants (either presenters or viewers) who cannot travel to the campus of Cornell University in Ithaca. In person participation will be a priority, but it has proven useful to have remote participation possible in case of travel or personal difficulties that make travel to Ithaca impossible. Remote viewers and participants will have to register for the workshop as do all other participants, thereby facilitating record keeping and reporting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A crucial idea in this area is the notion of a dividing line, meaning a fundamental dichotomy among mathematical structures. Historically, the most important of these dividing lines is stability, a notion which has found extensive applications in the setting of  infinite structures. In contrast, the fields of extremal and arithmetic combinatorics focus mainly on  finitary problems, but have thematic elements in common with model theory. In recent years, extensive interactions have begun between model theory and these fields, leading to surprising new results.  This project will further explore these connections by establishing a model theoretic understanding of important tools from arithmetic and extremal combinatorics.  Understanding these tools from a model theoretic perspective has the potential to lead to novel applications in both fields. The educational component of this project focuses on broadening participation efforts utilizing Ohio State infrastructure and the organization of a summer school for graduate students.<br/> <br/>In extremal and additive combinatorics, hypergraph regularity and higher order Fourier analysis have proved to be powerful tools.  The goal of this project is to develop connections between these tools and generalizations of stability theory.  The PI will prove theorems connecting tame behavior in hypergraph and arithmetic regularity lemmas to new generalizations of stability.   Complementing this, the PI will develop the pure model theory of these higher order notions of stability, as well as higher order analogues of stable group theory.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Network visualization is a particularly powerful and relevant approach for learners to understand. In a network visualization, people, places, and things are the nodes in a network, displayed as circles. These nodes are connected by lines that represent interactions. Learners can view relationships between nodes and lines in a network using either a dynamic visualization or they can view network data as a table. The two different representations together can help learners explore data in many contexts. This exploration is particularly relevant for data about relationships built on popular social media platforms. Therefore, network visualizations present a unique opportunity to explore data and data literacy in rich social contexts that are of interest for, and relevance to, youth learners. As they explore a range of locally relevant contexts across disciplines, learners will be engaged with core data literacy principles. To accomplish this, the project team will design, implement, and study an instructional unit about network visualization using the open-source Net.Create software tool that this team previously created to support intuitive, collaborative network visualization. As part of a co-design process with teachers, the team will create a curriculum unit that encourages 7th and 8th grade students to engage in core network visualization and key data literacy practices that meet disciplinary standards. The curriculum will integrate students? interests and cultural identities, and those of their communities. For example, network visualizations that may be explored include hobbies and activities they are engaged in as well as aspects of their culture or identity.   To help students appreciate network visualization in a robust manner, they will have opportunities to develop, critique, and revise the visualizations they build.<br/><br/>This project will take a synergistic approach in which middle school students use network visualization to learn about themselves and their communities. As the same time, students will also be learning about the underlying network science and data literacy principles that make their exploration possible, and which are central to their experiences with many common technologies. The project addresses three research questions over this three-year study: 1) How can students learn network and data literacy concepts through the creation of network visualizations with their peers? 2) How does exploring their collective identity, through topics of interest to students both individually and as a whole, using network visualization help motivate them to explore data literacy and integrate technology more deeply into their lives and careers? 3) What challenges and opportunities do teachers see in using network visualizations to support teaching data literacy concepts? The project team will engage in iterative co-design with a partner school district to adapt the draft curriculum to be locally relevant and meaningful. The project will also extend the Net.Create tool to support more robust exploration of the data literacy concepts such as data provenance. Data analysis will include pre / post measures of data literacy concepts and criticality, analysis of networks created by learners and computer logs, application of an engagement rubric that measures quality of student engagement with different activities, and interaction analysis of classroom activities to help articulate how learners used the tools to develop understanding of target concepts. The project team will work closely with two teachers in year 1, three teachers in year 2, and five teachers in year 3, while also scaling up the implementation to see how up to 20 additional teachers are subsequently able to implement the curriculum. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

By providing new 3D quantitative techniques that enable animal bones to be utilized as proxies of past anthropogenic and environmental impacts, this project contributes to important discussions about the conditions surrounding this transition.  These data provide the background conditions under which human sedentism and agriculture arose, allowing these events to be investigated on a local scale while simultaneously contributing to knowledge of how the earth?s major systems changed through time. Importantly, this research highlights the essential role of archaeology in recognizing the long-term impacts of humans on the environment, and how archaeological data can help guide policy and conservation efforts by informing on the ongoing interactions between humans, climate change and biotic communities. <br/><br/>In collaboration with an international team this research will develop new quantitative algorithms for 3D shape analysis including two new complete model analysis (CMA) procedures to position (orient in 3D space) and segment 3D bone models for quantitative analysis. These procedures will be applied to 3D bone models from modern skeletal material from mountain gazelles of known age, sex and geographic location to identify areas of bone surfaces that provide good markers of sex, precipitation, temperature and locomotion. These algorithms will be applied to 14 animal bone assemblages from archaeological sites spanning the foraging-farming transition to better understand the intensity and nature of human-environment interactions during this pivotal time in human prehistory. This study will contribute both by developing new algorithms to analyze 3D bone models, and by providing the necessary tools to interpret animal morphological data. Furthermore, the CMA algorithms generated by this project will have applicability to a wide set of research questions and can be adapted by other disciplines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Allostery in proteins can switch on and off the primary function through the binding of a molecule at a secondary site on the protein.  This behavior serves as important handle for the development of therapeutics as well as the design of novel proteins.  The computational workflows developed in the McCullagh group will be used to quantify allosteric response as well as identify new allosteric sites for further regulation of the protein.  The McCullagh group will also develop jupyter notebook-based chemistry lessons to both introduce chemistry concepts in a novel way and introduce aspects of coding to undergraduate chemistry students.<br/><br/>The McCullagh group will develop and verify a computational workflow to quantify allosteric response and describe the atomic-level details that underlie this behavior. Allostery is the altering of enzyme function at one site due to a perturbation of the enzyme at a distal site. Despite over a century of work on this topic, two key questions remain unanswered: (1) What are the atomic-level changes that contribute to allostery in a complete four-state thermodynamic cycle? (2) Can we harness the atomic-level allosteric mechanisms to identify new targets to impact the observed allostery?  This project will address these questions using two pyruvate kinase isozymes as model systems.  The K-type allosteric response of these enzymes is a pivotal control valve for the last step in glycolysis.

Not all threats can be directly addressed through local conservation actions. Instead, conservation may attempt to reduce or offset the effects of a larger threat (such as climate change) by managing local conditions (such as food availability). We still know very little about whether and when these approaches should succeed. To address this problem, this research and conservation project investigates effects of urbanization, climate change, and habitat management on a rare butterfly, the Crystal skipper (Atrytonopsis quinteri). This small insect is endemic to 50 km of North Carolina barrier islands, where larvae and adults require distinct resources?host plants and nectar?that may be disconnected in an urban landscape. All life stages also face risks from weather and climate stressors. This project aims to improve monitoring and management approaches for the Crystal skipper. In doing so, it provides broader insights into how conservation management may interact with climate in organisms with complex life cycles. This project also provides integrative research and conservation training for a graduate student, undergraduate students, and early-career conservation professionals, and involves local stakeholders in monitoring and outreach. <br/><br/>The specific objectives of this project are to: (1) develop a rigorous, sustainable, and unbiased survey methodology to estimate skipper population size and trends, (2) evaluate the role of connectivity (ease of movement) between host plants and nectar plants in limiting skipper populations, (3) assess whether management can increase Crystal skipper populations and offset effects of climate change, and (4) implement adaptive, robust, and strategic improvements to the existing Crystal skipper conservation plan. This research combines modern technologies (unmanned aerial systems to detect patchy nectar resources), field surveys, and circuit theory to quantify how mobile organisms use resources in an urban matrix. It also relates demographic rates to environmental and climate variables and constructs a mechanistic population model to test the effects of management interventions and weather/climate variation on skipper population growth. Finally, it combines results of research, monitoring, and stakeholder input to prioritize management actions and develop an adaptive monitoring program that will resolve critical uncertainties impeding Crystal skipper management.<br/><br/>This project is being supported via a joint program involving the Divisions of Environmental Biology and Integrative Organismal Systems and the Paul G.

ECCs are a fundamental tool to protect data from noise, and the past decade has seen many breakthroughs, both theoretical and practical.  Pseudorandomness is the study of deterministic objects that ?behave like random objects,? and is a fundamental area in theoretical computer science.  Connections between ECCs and pseudorandomness have been noted before, and indeed there is a rich interplay between the two areas.  However, the time is right to revisit this connection in light of recent breakthroughs in ECCs.  In doing so, this project leads not only to further progress in pseudorandomness by leveraging ECCs, but will also lead to further progress in ECCs, as applications in pseudorandomness highlight important questions in ECCs where current techniques fall short.  This project supports graduate and undergraduate education and research, as well as outreach beyond academia.  This is a joint NSF-BSF grant; the Israeli PI is Dr. Dean Doron of Ben Gurion University.<br/><br/>There are two main thrusts of this research.  The first thrust has to do with a notion called ?list-recovery,? which has become increasingly important in the study of ECCs.  However, recent progress in list-recovery has worked only in a particular parameter regime, which unfortunately is not the parameter regime of interest in pseudorandomness applications.  This research investigates list-recovery beyond the parameter regime that is currently understood.  Studying list recovery in this parameter regime also has algorithmic applications beyond either coding theory or pseudorandomness.  The second thrust has to do with the classical problem of obtaining binary codes with efficient algorithms and the optimal trade-offs between rate (the amount of communication overhead) and distance (a measure of the amount of noise tolerated).  This project leverages progress on list-recovery to make progress on this difficult problem.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Central to this effort is the development of a ?Scholars Academy,? a cohort-based program to support undergraduate students with peer mentoring, undergraduate research opportunities, and additional support. The academy is designed to improve undergraduate success, particularly for Hispanic students. The project will address a number of well documented challenges to undergraduate student success, including the fact that Hispanic STEM students persist in STEM at a lower rate than their non-Hispanic peers. Communities of Practice (CoPs) ? groups of people who share a common concern and work and learn together ? will be developed among students, faculty, and administrators to ensure longer term retention of students and create institutional transformation by sustaining best practices. Through this project, Kean will increase the number of faculty engaging in research with undergraduates, and who are also trained in culturally responsive mentoring. These practices are intended to increase student retention, job readiness, and improve participants' sense of belonging.<br/><br/>Key to this Scholars Academy will be three CoPs fostered as part of the project activities. To foster these communities, activities will be implemented based on smaller programs already piloted in two academic units at Kean. The first such activity is to build a community of student scholars, and meet the needs of students during critical attrition points, by offering a STEM major-specific version of the ""Transition to Kean? first-year seminar. First- and second-year courses with high D, F, and withdrawal (DFW) rates will be targeted for supplemental instruction using peer-mentoring and peer-led team learning. Secondly, students will engage in small faculty-led research teams using the Computing Alliance for Hispanic Serving Institutions? (CAHSI) Affinity Research Group model, with progress over multiple years and mentoring by senior-level students. A third activity involves implementing signature practices from CAHSI and Kean?s Center for Teaching and Learning to provide a variety of faculty professional development experiences aimed at enhancing advising and faculty pedagogy. A fourth and final activity is to form a team of faculty and administrators who will participate in an institutional transformation CoP that will help the project iteratively improve and institutionalize key project components. Project research will generate new knowledge on the effectiveness of the project's main interventions and what mechanisms supported the persistence and institutionalization of specific practices. The HSI Program aims to enhance undergraduate STEM education, broaden participation in STEM, and build capacity at HSIs. Achieving these aims, given the diverse nature and context of the HSIs, requires innovative approaches that incentivize institutional and community transformation and promote fundamental research (i) on engaged student learning, (ii) about what it takes to diversify and increase participation in STEM effectively, and (iii) that improves our understanding of how to build institutional capacity at HSIs that are supported by this program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Meyer of the University of Pittsburgh is preparing novel brush copolymer materials with 2-dimensional sequence control and studying the combined effects of both backbone and sidechain sequence on the hydrolytic degradation profiles.  Polymer brushes are type of macromolecules in which the main polymer chain is grafted with additional polymer chains of varying density.  They have useful properties including wormlike conformations, compact molecular dimensions, and notable polymer chain-end effects due to their compact and confined structures. As such, the brushes are promising polymers for biomedical devices, chemical sensors, drug-delivery systems, and tissue engineering.  In this research, chemical reactions will first be used to prepare polymer brushes with biodegradable and biocompatible side chains consisting of different sequences of lactic and glycolic acids.  The prepared brushes will then be utilized in degradation studies with the aim to investigate the effects of different brush architectures and 2-dimensional sequences of side chains on the degradation rate.  The activities associated with this research are designed to broaden participation and enable training of undergraduate and graduate students in polymer chemistry, organic synthesis, and catalysis.  The interactions with a Charter 1 NOBCChE collaborative consisting of six institutions, including three historically black colleges & universities (HBCUs), will continue to focus on fostering long-term relationships among members with the goal of working together to support the success and retention of students from underrepresented groups in chemistry.<br/><br/>This research will focus on controlling sequences in brush copolymers containing biodegradable and biocompatible ""alpha-hydroxy acid derived"" sidechains.  In the first objective, one- and two-dimensional sequence controlled norbornene based brushes will be prepared using ruthenium catalyzed ring-opening metathesis polymerization.  Grafting through methodology optimized for lactic and glycolic acids side chains will be utlized.  The second objective will focus on the synthesis and characterization of cyclic brush copolymers with two-dimensional sequence control including variants that can be ring-opened using an entropy-driven polymerization to create alternating brush-linear multiblock copolymers.  Lastly, the combined effects of sequence and architecture on hydrolytic degradation rates, with the goal of developing a mechanistic understanding of the degradation in sequenced brush copolymers, will be investigated.  Fundamental studies related to understanding of the interactions between polymer architecture and degradation have the potential to lead to improved design of brush-based drug delivery vehicles.  Additionally, the synthesis and characterization of the brush-linear multiblock copolymers associated with this research could impact applications that require polymers with tissue-like properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With the new capability, underwater robots will overcome the limited onboard energy, thus, could conduct persistent ocean sensing and connect them with other ocean observing systems to collect key observations at coastal and remote locations (e.g., under-ice or at deep sea) on critical energetic, transient, and unpredictable ocean processes (such as erupting submarine volcanos, triggered biogeochemical plumes, episodical anoxic upwelling waters). Moreover, underwater resident robots could provide persistent monitoring of structural health and water properties to support reliable offshore energy and aquaculture production, addressing the grand challenges, i.e., climate change and food security. The project will integrate research with educational programs on training the workforce in underwater robotics and ocean technology. Specifically, this project will support: 1) two graduate students to conduct fundamental research on underwater robots; 2) up to twenty high school students to build underwater robots and interact with underwater docking systems through summer workshops; 3) two capstone projects on underwater docking arm design and building allowing up to 10 undergraduate students to conduct original research; and 4) integrate research into two robotic classes (about 80 students) in the forms of special topics and demonstrations.<br/><br/>With an overarching goal of achieving safe and reliable underwater docking operations, this project seeks to advance three fundamental robotic topics: underwater localization, dynamic modeling, and nonlinear control. First, a learning-augmented pose estimator will be developed to advance vision-based robot localization. The method will adapt deep neural networks (DNNs) to derive the slant range between a camera to a light beacon-based color intensities from a single image. Second, a new DNN-based dynamic model will be created for underwater robots. The model will be trained using real-world data to capture the highly nonlinear mapping between the robot's actuation control signals and the robot states, which are typically ignored or simplified in existing underwater system identification and modeling methods. The new model will potentially improve vehicle control and localization performance, which are critical for underwater docking. Third, a new sampling-based solver will be designed and validated for nonlinear model predictive control. The method will offer an end-to-end computational tractable solution to control multiple robot states simultaneously while incorporating actuation constraints, energy optimization, and model uncertainties.

Earthquakes in the Central and Eastern United States (CEUS), far from any plate boundary, are a bit of a mystery; scientists cannot agree on why they happen. Dr. Adam and her team will investigate how convective motions in the Earth's mantle, hundreds of miles below the surface, may contribute to forces in the brittle crust, causing at least some CEUS earthquakes. Her study makes use of data from the USArray, an NSF-funded national experiment in which a dense network of seismometers was left out to record earthquakes for years at a time. In addition to a thorough 'catalogue' of CEUS earthquakes (size, timing and location), the US Array has provided new information on the structure of the subsurface. Dr. Adam will use this information to build detailed computational models and perform calculations of mantle convection and forces in the crust (and earthquakes) this convection might cause. She will also train a graduate student and participate in Kansas State University's science education and outreach programs for girls, young people from groups that are underrepresented in the sciences, and the broader public. <br/><br/>Data collected through the US Array and other complementary networks have provided a much clearer and more accurate image of surface deformation and seismic velocity structure of the crust and mantle in the United States. Dr. Adam will use these data, together with ConvRS geodynamic models, to assess the role of mantle dynamics on stresses and intraplate seismicity in the Central and Eastern United States. A preliminary step will be to sort through several published tomographic models using a systematic method to remove spurious features. She and her team will interpret tomographic velocity data with thermodynamic and anelasticity theory to infer mantle and crust rheology and buoyancy forces, making geodynamic model inputs as compatible as possible with geophysical observations. The effects of the Glacial Isostatic Adjustment (GIA), based on previous studies, will also be represented. Model outputs (stress axis orientation and geoid height) will be compared to observations, and sensitivity of these results to parameter variations will be assessed. The main questions Dr.  Adam plans to address are (1) What are the structure and dynamics of the sub-continental lithospheric mantle? (2) How do they correlate with intraplate seismicity? and (3) Which part of the observed seismicity is related to shallow crustal and lithospheric structures, which is due to GIA, and which is due to deeper processes?<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the NSF Geophysics Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Semantics is the meaning of words and sentences. Prosody is the patterns of intonation and stress in a language; the melody of a language. While individuals process the meaning of utterances in conversation (i.e., what you say), they also detect the emotional prosody of the speaker (i.e., how you say it). Emotional prosody refers to the ways in which the tone of voice can be modulated to convey positive and negative emotions. The simultaneous processing of semantics and emotional prosody can be challenging for second language (L2) learners, especially in tonal languages, where the tone of voice can encode both meaning and emotion. This study investigates how meaning is affected by emotional prosody, and it elucidates the neural basis of how native speakers and second language learners process semantics and emotional prosody in a tonal language. <br/><br/>The doctoral dissertation project uses functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI), which identifies language processing areas in the working human brain, to examine how semantics (e.g., positive, ?wise?; negative meaning ?arrogant?) affect the processing of emotional prosody in words (Experiment 1) and sentences (Experiment 2) in a tonal language. Specifically, the researchers compare the brain areas activated by semantics and emotional prosody, and then examine brain regions that process emotions regardless of channels (semantics or prosody), and brain regions that are unique to semantics and to emotional prosody respectively. The results thus clarify whether native speakers and L2 learners use the same brain mechanisms to process semantics and emotional prosody in words and sentences in a tonal language. The project has pedagogical implications for L2 instruction where emotional cues in language use is often ignored and provides insights into the role of emotional prosody in cross-cultural communication.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Climate projections indicate that the Arctic will continue to warm, but uncertainties arise due to questions about the future behavior of Arctic clouds.  An area of primary uncertainty is the properties of clouds that form during cold-air outbreaks, where very cold airmasses over the Arctic ice move southward over the relatively warm open ocean.  This award will help to provide observational data of these clouds (and precipitation) and the exchange of energy between the ocean and atmosphere during the Cold-Air outbreak Experiment in the Sub-Arctic Region (CAESAR), which will be conducted in Spring 2024 out of northern Scandinavia.  The observations collected during CAESAR will be used in an effort to better understand the characteristics of the cold-air outbreak system, and the Arctic climate system more broadly, in order to inform climate models and projections.  The project will also help to improve forecasting of weather hazards with significant relevance to naval operations, commercial shipping, and coastal communities.  The broader field effort includes significant opportunities for students and early-career scientists, international collaboration, and public outreach.  This award will feature multiple routes for participation by undergraduate students through existing programs at the University of Oklahoma.   <br/><br/>This project focuses on providing fundamental new understanding of the microphysical processes responsible for the production and maintenance of supercooled liquid water (SLW) in cold air outbreaks (CAOs), including the role of primary ice nucleation and secondary ice production, surface fluxes and turbulent mixing.  The research team will have primary responsibility of coordinating with NCAR on the use and processing of the CDP, 2DS, 2DC, HVPS3, King, RICE and Nevzorov probes.  The 2DS, 2DC and HVPS3 data will be processed using the University of Illinois/Oklahoma Optical Array Probe Processing Software (UIOOPS).  The testable hypotheses include:  1) variations in SLW, ice mass and ice in drizzle at given cloud top temperatures are more correlated with updraft velocities than aerosol, cloud condensation nuclei (CCN), and ice nucleating particle (INP) properties;  2) relationships between cloud properties with aerosols and/or turbulence are different for stratus and convective clouds, with SLW playing a larger role in the former and turbulent mixing in the later; 3) generating cells are more prevalent/important in determining cloud properties when fetch is reduced due to more convective overturning, with primary ice initiation increasing with fetch, distance from the sea ice and CAO intensity; 4) glaciation is principally driven by secondary ice production; 5) cloud properties are more strongly correlated with aerosol and INP concentrations above cloud than below cloud.<br/><br/>Primary funding for this project comes from the Physical and Dynamic Meteorology program with partial funding from the Arctic Natural Sciences program.

This research into mechanical metamaterials will explore fundamental properties of active metamaterials never realized before by traditional research methods, potentially leading to the invention of novel electronic material systems that operate autonomously and serve various roles in engineering and medical applications. Specifically, this Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project will establish a new field of mechanical metamaterial electronics (meta-mechanotronics). This field couples the engineering domains of mechanical metamaterials, digital electronics, and nano energy harvesting. The generated knowledge will provide new road maps for design and discovery of self-powered autonomous engineered materials and future mechanical metamaterial computers. This CAREER award will accelerate the education of undergraduate and graduate researchers at the intersection of electronic materials, structural mechanics, green energy harvesting, and machine learning. An innovative outreach program is planned for K-12 students that will inspire them to pursue careers in STEM. Under the ?train-the-trainer? model, members of multiple ASCE Student Chapters will be trained and deployed with educational/development kits to educate thousands of middle and high school students nationally.<br/><br/>The overarching goal of this project is to broaden our understanding of the science of designing active electronic mechanical metamaterials with sensing, triboelectric energy harvesting, actuation, and information processing functionalities.  These material systems will be composed of rationally designed micro/nano structures with built-in contact-electrification mechanisms to realize such advanced functionalities. A computational data-centric framework based on topology optimization and machine learning will be created to explore new design possibilities for multi-layered and multi-material electronic mechanical metamaterials. Numerical and theoretical models will be developed to characterize the mechanical and electrical behavior of the explored mechanical metamaterials. Various rational designs for the triboelectric layers, material and surface optimization methods, and additive manufacturing processes will be investigated to increase the power output of the electronic mechanical metamaterials to levels on the order of 100-500 W. With these power output levels, electronic mechanical metamaterials can potentially be used for green energy harvesting to power low-power electronic devices. The electrical signals generated by these materials systems under external stimuli will be used to create self-powered mechanoelectrical-logic gates for digital computation. Digital information storage will be demonstrated by incorporating the data into the self-recovering unit cell patterns. Meta-mechanotronics-inspired digital circuits will be designed to perform basic computations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division).

However, ML is also susceptible to adversaries who can attack both the data models are trained on and the ML models themselves. This can lead to poor behavior in the models and poor decisions in the people who use them. This project?s goal is to advance our ability to detect and respond to attacks through focusing on provenance: systematic capture of the data and training methods used in building models, along with the inference processes and decisions made after they are deployed. By capturing these data and developing methods to use the data when assessing risks, auditing models, and forensically analyzing incidents, the work will make ML systems both more robust and more accountable around attacks. These capabilities will in turn benefit organizations that develop and use ML models, along with policymakers and regulators who oversee their effects. <br/><br/>The work is organized into three main thrusts. The first thrust focuses on systematic capture and characterization of pre-deployment (training) and post-deployment (inference) provenance, focusing on what constitutes training and inference provenance and the innate nondeterminism of ML computations. In particular, training and inference metadata, training progression, inference computation dynamics, and per-label characterization approaches will be explored. The second thrust will use these data for provenance-driven detection of training data poisoning and model evasion across a range of threat models and application domains. For poisoning detection, both similarity-based and distribution shift detection-based approaches will be pursued while for evasion detection, inference provenance will be analyzed empirically and structurally. The third thrust focuses on developing post-compromise forensics capabilities with the goal of tracing back attacks to their cause(s) and mitigating future attacks. Integrated with these three thrusts is an educational plan that includes developing new courses on ML trustworthiness for undergraduate and graduate students, robust ML-focused ethical hacking competitions for undergraduates, and K-12 summer camps on robust ML to develop and diversify the next generation of cybersecurity workers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR) is a powerful tool for metabolomics due to its excellent analytical reproducibility and ability to detect numerous metabolites in a single measurement. NMR metabolomics is conventionally performed on a high-field (HF) spectrometer, but the recent development of benchtop spectrometers has led to a resurgence of interest in low-field (LF) NMR due to its accessibility, low cost and small footprint compared to HF. NMR metabolomics at both HF and benchtop LF, however, require time-consuming, user-dependent processing and expertise for metabolite identification and quantification. Due to these limitations, both HF and LF NMR are underexplored for metabolomics research in the biological community. This project will fill these critical gaps by developing, validating, and disseminating real-time, high-throughput NMR metabolomic techniques for both HF and benchtop LF NMR for advancing biological infrastructure and research. This interdisciplinary project will prepare the next generation of women and minorities to pursue bioengineering and bioinformatics career?currently an under-represented discipline. The project will also integrate research with educational objectives to target the broader community from K?12 to graduate students and the general public: (a) coursework to strengthen biosignal processing & analysis skills in undergraduate and graduate curricula; (b) internships, targeted to talented women, minority, and low-income college students; (c) hands-on STEM projects to motivate high-schoolers through collaboration with school teachers; (d) disseminate bioengineering research to support K?12 learning through the Society of Women Engineers, West TN STEM Hub, and Girls Experiencing Engineering programs; and (e) educational exhibits at local museums to enable public outreach and exposure to NMR applications. This early hands-on exposure will benefit students of all ages to understand fundamental concepts and realize NMR applications in a broad range of fields?including molecular biology, biomedical engineering and chemical engineering?and ultimately motivate them to pursue a STEM career. <br/><br/>The project will develop, validate, and disseminate open-access metabolomic techniques that will automatically quantify the metabolites in complex biological spectra obtained from high-field (HF) and benchtop low-field (LF) NMR via the following objectives: 1) investigate high-throughput metabolomic methods for HF NMR using deep learning, 2) reconstruct high-resolution and high-throughput spectra from benchtop LF NMR using autoencoder, 3) investigate these techniques for inquiring biological questions, and 4) disseminate metabolomic libraries and techniques for biological research and education via an open-access software.

Nevertheless, blood flow to the brain is tightly controlled by a mechanism called autoregulation, because even momentary disruptions in blood flow can lead to strokes, while excess blood flow can result in brain bleeds. Due to this critical role, quantitative measurements of autoregulation and brain blood flow can be used to detect brain injuries, monitor treatment, and even predict recovery. Unfortunately, there is currently no portable, easy-to-use instrument that physicians can use to quantitatively and continuously image brain blood flow at a patient's bedside. To address this technology gap, this project will develop the first wearable optical imaging instrument for bedside, noninvasive imaging of brain blood flow and autoregulation dynamics in humans. In addition to helping clinicians manage brain injuries, this imaging instrument will improve our understanding of critical brain function and will help identify undiagnosed local brain injuries. The educational and outreach goal of this project is to develop and distribute modular electronic-lego kits that will foster fun, experiential learning of electronic design for all ages. <br/><br/>Cerebrovascular autoregulation (CVAR) is an important homeostatic mechanism that controls cerebral blood flow (CBF) during changes in arterial blood pressure and metabolic demand. Since disruption of this autonomic process is strongly indicative of disease, quantitative measurements of CVAR dynamics are functional biomarkers for brain injuries including ischemic strokes, traumatic brain injuries and Alzheimer's disease. Unfortunately, the state of current clinical monitoring is limited to CBF measurements at a few locations in the head, forcing CVAR metrics to be characterized as a single global number that ignores spatial distributions, potentially leading to undiagnosed local injuries. To address this technical limitation, this project will develop new portable optical technology to quantitatively measure cerebral blood flow with Diffuse Correlation Spectroscopy (DCS). Specifically, (1) this project will build the world's first wearable optical device for quantitative monitoring blood flow, featuring technical innovations that dramatically shrink the footprint of a DCS blood flow monitor from a large briefcase to a 1 sq. in. optical probe. (2) The project will then adapt this wearable blood flow sensor for use over the entire human head for non-invasive imaging of cerebral blood flow (CBF) in humans. Rigorous experiments will be conducted on tissue-simulating phantoms, and in humans, to characterize the accuracy, sensitivity, and noise performance of the CBF imager. The devices developed in this project are unique for the broader neuroimaging community. With appropriate dissemination and commercialization of this technology, this first-of-its kind CBF imager can help a broad cohort of researchers who study the brain including neurologists, neuroscientists, phycologists, and behavioral scientists, and can also be adapted for other tissue types.<br/><br/>The proposal was co-funded by the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental, and Transport Systems (CBET) in the Directorate of  Engineering.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A significant challenge in studying decision making is testing how well a hypothesis or theory is supported by data. In many studies, we only see the outcome of a decision of interest, which makes it difficult to understand the process that led to that decision and to directly test theories about that process. Computational models have proven valuable as tools to encode theories and test them against observations. However, computational models present technical barriers that limit their usability and constrain the scope of questions that can be addressed. This project will provide a suite of efficient yet generally usable computational approaches and tools that facilitate model construction and analysis. The new methods to be developed will broaden the scope of investigations that are possible and the researchers who can carry them out. To ensure their broadest possible usability, the tools will be disseminated in freely available software packages. The investigators will use these tools to study the properties of multi-alternative, multi-attribute choice and assess how context influences people's choices in naturalistic settings. Students supported by this project will be trained in state-of-the-art computational methods which are becoming increasingly more common in science and industry.<br/><br/>This project will develop advanced Bayesian methodologies for performing parameter estimation for choice-response time (RT) models. The time it takes for people to make decisions (RTs) provides valuable information about the dynamic process responsible for those decisions. For this reason, models that predict both choices and RTs are used to study decision processes. However, it is challenging to fit these types of models to data, which is a necessary step in assessing the quality of the theories they encode. As a result, model-based approaches are most often applied using decades old models in conjunction with simple experimental designs, both to maintain tractability. To address these issues, this project will develop a set of accessible, high-quality probabilistic methods that are documented to be effective at performing Bayesian parameter estimation for a wide variety of choice-RT models. Researchers will be able to construct more complex choice-RT models and utilize more complex experimental designs, which in combination can facilitate new scientific investigations. As an example of this, the investigators will study the role of context in decisions involving naturalistic information encoded in, for example, semantic or image-based stimuli. Machine-learning models of language or image representations will be integrated with choice-RT models encoding different assumptions about contextual dependencies. These models are fit to complex data sets derived from large-scale experimental designs involving large numbers of participants making naturalistic decisions. The results of this study will help resolve the debate about whether naturalistic choices show context-dependency, which is observed with more artificial stimuli.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It states that among all the bodies with a given volume, the ball has the smallest possible surface area. This is the reason why soap bubbles are round - they minimize their surface pressure and thus assume the shape with the smallest surface area. In the recent years, it has become clear that under additional symmetry and convexity assumptions, many isoperimetric-type results become stronger. In this project, the role that symmetry and convexity play in isoperimetric-type questions in high dimensions and several other questions in this field will be researched. In addition to this direction, asymptotic questions about the geometry of high-dimensional spaces will be investigated. When the number of parameters increases, it seems that the question should become more complicated, and therefore, studying some precise questions in a high-dimensional space seems hopelessly difficult. However, it turns out that with many parameters comes beauty and simplicity, and things start behaving in some predictable way. A simple example of this phenomenon is the fact that polls usually exhibit behavior close to the normal distribution. Several questions in that vein will be approached, with potential applications in learning theory. A study of the behavior of large random matrices with so-called inhomogeneous profiles will be performed. This is a direction with potential applications in areas such as Statistics, Computer Science, Physics, and more. Other parts of this project will involve supervising postdocs, graduate and undergraduate students, and organizing seminars and conferences.<br/><br/>The isoperimetric inequality is a consequence of the celebrated Brunn-Minkowski inequality, an important result which is used ubiquitously in convex geometry. Over the last 20 years it has become clear that the Brunn-Minkowski inequality is not the end of the story. If one deals only with bodies that have certain symmetries, much stronger inequalities should also be true. This yielded many conjectures such as the log-Brunn-Minkowski conjecture, the (B)-conjecture, and the Dimensional Brunn-Minkowski conjecture. Using isoperimetric-type inequalities via their local versions these fundamental open questions will be approached. In addition, several directions in Asymptotic Geometric Analysis are part of this project, such as creating a fast algorithm which learns a convex body with respect to a general log-concave measure. The ensemble of inhomogeneous random matrices will be studied, using the previously developed methods which involve a new efficient discretization of the unit sphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most radio glaciology research projects are limited to whatever airborne ice-penetrating radar (IPR) data happens to already exist in the area of interest. Collecting new IPR data is a long and slow process, usually well outside the scope of individual research teams, especially in resource-intensive Antarctic glaciology research. This proposal seeks to field-test and validate two community-driven instruments that help address this gap in Antarctic research: a snowmobile-towed radar as well as a UAV (uncrewed aerial vehicle) system. Both systems are based off a common software control system and share the same code and post-processing tools. As part of this proposal, this code will be made available under an open-source license for other researchers to use and adapt, along with instructions for creating compatible hardware setups from commercially available parts, in order for them to be able to study glaciers and ice sheets at higher capacity and lower cost.<br/><br/>The snowmobile-towed radar will be a multi-frequency, polarimetric chirped radar system designed to illuminate thermal, material, and roughness properties at the ice-bed interface. The PEREGRINE UAV system is a chirped radar with 56 MHz of bandwidth built into a small fixed-wing uncrewed aircraft that packs away into a single Pelican case for rapid small-scale surveys. The variables to be measured by these systems are critical observational data for projecting future behavior of the Antarctic ice sheet. The project spans two years and incorporates two seasons of field testing planned for Summit Station, Greenland, due to the need to test on a thick, cold ice sheet as well as the lower cost and risk of supporting instrument testing in the Arctic compared to Antarctica. The period between the field seasons will be used to initiate or continue conversations with researchers interested in incorporating our instruments into future fieldwork or adapting our core radar system into new instruments. This will give us an opportunity to develop new capabilities in response to this feedback and conduct relevant system tests during the second field season. A period after the second field season is reserved for the development of detailed documentation and preparation for the open release of code and systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Anthropologists have long been interested in the effects of cultural consonance, especially in relation to its ability to buffer individuals against adversity. One intriguing but under-studied extension of this relationship is that one person?s cultural consonance can affect others who depend on them. This project tests this proposition by investigating whether children of parents with high cultural consonance are also buffered from adversity. It does so in contexts of extreme poverty, where even marginal environmental improvements can have large effects on child well-being. The project contributes to training a graduate student in scientific cultural anthropology, disseminates its research findings broadly to academic and non-academic audiences, and involves collaborative partnerships, including with policy experts, that improve research capacity and infrastructure. This project is jointly funded by the Cultural Anthropology Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). <br/><br/>Through interviews and questionnaires, the researchers gather data from caregivers of children ages 2 to 5 who live in poverty and from their children. First, they will analyze if caregivers who live according to shared cultural values promote stimulating activities and positive discipline among their children more frequently than other caregivers. To study this association, they will collect data from 100 caregivers and their children and analyze them using rigorous qualitative and quantitative methods. Second, the researchers will examine if the children of caregivers who live according to shared cultural values are less likely to suffer developmental delays. For this part of the research, they will study 1,000 caregivers and their children, analyze the data statistically, and use predictive models to determine the cultural factors that buffer the effect of poverty on early childhood development. The project contributes important extensions of prior theory to understand the direct and indirect effects of cultural consonance on health and well-being and a more holistic understanding of which domains of consonance are most important for doing so.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Per this vision, computers would serve as disinterested decision-makers, processing and acting on citizens? personal data in a manner lacking subjective interpretation or racial bias. However, citizens and racial justice activists warned that poorly designed government computing systems could obfuscate and reify inequalities. This research unpacks this debate and analyzes the systems that emerged from it. It speaks to contemporary concerns about algorithmic bias and inequities in computing and information technologies more broadly. By highlighting the political forces and technical designs that have driven computational inequalities in the past, the dissertation highlights different ways in which the most harmful elements of computing technologies might be dismantled, subverted, or retooled and will be of interest to lawmakers, computing professionals, and scholars committed to creating more just data systems.<br/><br/>To this end, this project combines theoretical frameworks from Science and Technology Studies with archival research to examine the racial ideas that shaped the development and use of three different government computing systems: the employment service?s Job Service Matching System, law enforcement?s National Crime Information Center, and public health?s Epidemiologic Surveillance Project. The project asks: how did U.S. government computing systems and social scientific ideas about race complicate and mutually shape one another? How were the technical practices of computerized identification central sites for political and scientific struggles to explain the causes of, and solutions to, various forms of racial inequality in postwar America?

Microporosity is an important property affecting the performance of polymers in applications such as water purification, gas storage, gas purification, energy harvesting, sensing, and catalysis, yet there are few design principles for controlling it. The goal of this project is to address this knowledge gap by exploring the hypothesis that defects strongly influence microporosity. Dr. Bour and his team aim to establish relationships between defects and porosity through the development of chemical reactions that allow quantification and simulation of potential defect structures. These studies have the potential to result in improved understanding of key structural features in high microporosity polymers. Insights gain will aid in the hypothesis-directed design of synthetic approaches to microporous polymers. In parallel with these studies, Dr. Bour will host a yearly state continuing education clock hour program in polymer chemistry for middle and high school teachers in Michigan. This activity is designed to interface directly with early science education mission in the state, helping to prepare the nation?s future workforce in polymer science. <br/><br/>Owing to their high microporosity, structural diversity, and robust chemical stability, porous organic polymers have potential to address modern challenges in water purification, energy harvesting, gas storage/purification, catalysis, and sensing. Polymer porosity, and ultimately their performance in these targeted applications, is strongly affected by synthetic approach. However, little is known about why some reactions consistently and significantly outperform other synthetic strategies. This project aims to address this fundamental knowledge gap by studying how reaction-dependent defect structures impact bulk porosity. Spectroscopic interrogation of defects in microporous network polymers is historically challenging. This research will instead focus on determination of defect-porosity relationships through chemical methods. Network disassembly approaches specifically designed for the rigid structures of porous polymers will be used to characterize native defectivity in model polymers. Systematic relationships between defect incidence and structure will be determined through copolymerization of conventional monomers with defect-simulating or pro-defective monomers.   Taken together, these studies are expected to establish quantitative relationships between defects and porosity metrics such as apparent surface area, pore volume, and pore size distribution. Insights gained will help guide the development of improved and more controlled synthetic protocols, particularly for high surface area microporous polymers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project uses field experiments to seek behavioral explanations for such under-investment using the Tuberculosis Preventative Therapy (TPT)?a course of medication that prevents the progression of latent Tuberculosis (TB) infection into disease---as a case study. TPT uptake among adult contacts is low, despite being offered at no cost to the recipient. This project investigates whether this is due to incorrect beliefs of low infection risk (misinformation), or if contacts do not take the therapy for fear of being stigmatized or fear of adverse drug reactions (motivated beliefs). While misinformation can be solved with targeted information campaigns, motivated beliefs may not be easily solved, hence it is important to disentangle these behavioral sources of under-investment in formulated effective public health policies.  The results of this research will provide major guide to developing polices to increase investment in preventative health, thus improving the level of health and human capital generally.  Improved health and general human capital would also lead to faster economic growth, further increasing the living standards of Americans.  <br/><br/>Two behavioral explanations for incorrect beliefs about low infection risk are hypothesized---lack of awareness about the risk of contracting the infection (misinformed beliefs) and deliberate underestimation of infection risk to cope with fears of stigmatization (motivated beliefs about low susceptibility). To test these hypotheses, adult household who have contacts with a recently diagnosed pulmonary TB patients will be surveyed to elicit beliefs about TB infection risk. The elicited beliefs will be used to empirically test theoretical predictions for motivated belief formation (against misinformation). To account for an alternate possibility of motivation  by high non-monetary costs, the project also elicits how contacts trade off the non-monetary costs of TPT against the expected benefits, using discrete choice experiments with hypothetical TPT-taking scenarios. The beliefs and preferences thus elicited will then be used to estimate a model of contacts? TPT uptake decisions; the estimates will be used to simulate contacts? responses under various counterfactual policy scenarios.

Having a commercial product capable of determining and delivering the trailer?s best aerodynamic profile based on real-time operating conditions may be a game-changer for the trucking industry, as fuel is a significant operating cost. Commercializing this system has the potential to create an energy savings for all US fleets, saving more than 3 billion gallons of diesel fuel, reducing the release of more than 33.5 million tons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, tripling trucking company profits, and saving an annual $22 billion.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase II project proposes development of an aerodynamic add-on prototype for semi-trucks to save fuel by dynamically changing the trailer?s aerodynamic profile to accommodate diverse operating conditions. Objectives of this SBIR Project are to evolve the device from prototype to the first commercially viable release through system miniaturization and encapsulation, controller optimization, and improved overall system performance, reliability, and safety. Research conducted to miniaturize the overall system footprint will minimize any additional operational impacts, ensuring widespread adoption and utilization that maximizes fuel savings. Research to optimize the Artificial Intelligence-Controller operation will maximize fuel savings because it will allow the device to operate under a broader set of operational conditions. Further development to improve system performance, reliability, and the addition of a safety assist will improve the profit margins of the trucking industry while simultaneously improving on-road safety for the public. The project seeks to deliver 10% savings in operational costs for the trucking industry while improving the efficiency and safety of their country-wide operations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Growing and erupting teeth are among the most transformative drivers of changes in facial appearance, promoting bone formation and influencing overall jaw growth. Prior research has focused on the eruption of ?baby teeth?, or deciduous teeth, and subsequent permanent teeth. However, the period near or at birth, when many teeth are not yet fully developed, has rarely been studied. This study investigates the role(s) of teeth in facial development during early critical periods, and results inform a better understanding regarding how different parts of anatomy can influence the appearance of others, as well as the whole organism. The project generates 3D models, a website and other resources for K-12 students and provides training and professional development to one postdoctoral scholar and multiple graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This study investigates the underpinnings of functional matrix theory, which posits that bones that border soft tissue structures and other organs such as teeth, directly cause transformations of bone morphology. The principal investigators use the two sides of lower jaw to study cellular and tissue-level event in tooth and jaw formation, which are then mirrored on three-dimensional reconstructions of the opposite side of the jaw. The three-dimensional reconstructions are accomplished using micro computed tomographic (CT) scanning to detect bone, following by a second scan after soaking half of the jaw in iodine, after which unmineralized tooth germs are easily detectable using CT. Amira software are used to generate three-dimensional views that denote critical cellular and tissue-level mechanisms (i.e., cell signals for bone deposition and resorption, and bone cell maturation). CT will also be used for morphometric analyses. Ultimately, by investigating how developing teeth compete for space within a growing face, results are relevant for interpreting variation in modern and past anatomy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The grant enables the formation of a team, which consists of 12 investigators from five different universities representing five disciplines within physical science and engineering, to address fundamental scientific and engineering challenges associated with material design, manufacturing, property control and device integration, activities required to move germanium oxide semiconductors from academic laboratories into society-benefiting technologies including electric vehicles to autonomous systems. In parallel, the team coordinates activities to make progress on the development of new materials and devices through co-design principles. Concurrent with these activities, the project pilots workforce development initiatives to help bolster the United States technical workforce in the semiconductor sector. These include providing students from traditionally under-represented groups with summer research experiences focused on oxide semiconductors and creating educational and training opportunities for students at technical-focused colleges in geographic proximity to the teaming institutions. Additionally, the team builds inter-institutional and industrial partnerships to ensure the research and workforce development activities are aligned with national technological needs.<br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/><br/>The project applies a convergent and team-based approach to plan the realization of wide and narrow band gap germanium oxide-based semiconductors that can be doped, form alloys for band gap engineering, are not comprised of toxic elements, and can be processed into high performing devices. The team is building research collaborations aimed at advancing fundamental knowledge in areas related to thin film deposition, crystal growth, thermodynamic and electronic structure modeling, defect characterization, and device testing. The team works to understand and implement the materials synthesis conditions required to stabilize targeted germanium oxides in heterostructure form, while enabling both doping and alloying for property engineering. Computational and experimental activities provide strategies for understanding and controlling defects, either those desired (dopants) or undesired (dislocations, point defects), within these semiconductors. The team develops an understanding of the ultimate limits to the fabrication and performance of junctions, contacts, and devices for high power electronics and sensing based on germanium oxide semiconductors. Co-design is infused throughout the scientific objectives such that issues related to manufacturing scalability, substrate development, and environmental impacts are evaluated and researched alongside heterostructure design and device demonstrations. The project pilots a two-pronged strategy for enabling new educational opportunities related to semiconductors. The first of these leverages the existing NSF-PREM programs to create a summer research opportunity for a student from an under-represented group in one of the participating labs each year; the second establishes educational opportunities for students at community or technical colleges.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The American Innovation and Manufacturing Act authorizes the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to phase down production and consumption of refrigerants causing global warming by 85 percent over 15 years. The societal, economical, and environmental benefits are estimated to create thousands of jobs and increase manufacturing by billions of dollars in the U.S. while reducing venting and incineration, and subsequently global temperature rise. There are millions of metric tons of mixed refrigerants that cannot be reclaimed using current fractional distillation technology. The proposed ionic liquid extractive distillation technology will make possible the separation and reuse of these complex refrigerant mixtures. The startup company funded through this project will provide a novel separation technology to the refrigerant industry that is of strategic national interest. Outreach activities, especially toward the inclusion of women and underrepresented minorities will be supported through this project.<br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate that complex, multi-component, azeotropic refrigerant mixtures can be separated using ionic liquids, and that the products can meet industry standard specifications. Refrigerant mixture R-404A, used broadly throughout the commercial refrigeration industry (e.g., grocery stores) is a complex, ternary azeotropic mixture containing HFC-143a (1,1,1-trifluoroethane), which has a high global warming potential. HFC-143a will be one of the first refrigerants to be reused in new low global warming blends containing hydrofluoroolefins if the HFC-143a can be economically separated. Over 100 complex, multicomponent refrigerant mixtures exist in the market. This project will enable the development of processes, technologies, and systems designs required for industry to meet and exceed the phase down goals. The program objectives include the separation of R-404A into components, the creation of a process model, and testing of recovered R-404A from industry to understand the effects of impurities. The results will be used to develop a technoeconomic model and commercial scale designs that the team will build and/or license to the refrigerant industry.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sylvatic (better known as bubonic) plague was introduced to North America in 1900 and is now maintained in native mammals in the western U.S., periodically eliciting disease outbreaks. Although some species seem to have natural resistance, others?such as prairie dogs?are highly susceptible. Despite the detection of plague resistance in a small number of prairie dogs, the disease still decimates populations throughout their range. The continued susceptibility of prairie dogs suggests there is some constraint inhibiting the widespread evolution of resistance to plague. This project uses whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing of resistant and susceptible prairie dogs to determine the genomic basis of recently evolved plague resistance. Mutations associated with resistance in natural populations and experiments will then be mapped in nature to determine the spatial distribution of resistance alleles and predict the location of potential resistance hotspots. Museum specimens of prairie dogs will also be genotyped to determine the rate of evolution of plague resistance. Given the increasing rate of novel pathogens emerging around the globe, this research will have broad implications for understanding when and where adaptation in nave hosts is likely to persist. This project will use research to enhance education by building capacity in universities serving Native American and Hispanic students. Traveling genomics workshops will be delivered to students and faculty, and students will be mentored at their own institutions as they conduct independent research in the system.<br/><br/>Adaptation to pathogens should be heavily favored by selection: Once immunity evolves, it should sweep to fixation across a species? range. Paradoxically, a more commonly observed pattern is variable immunity. Because there are multiple explanations for incomplete resistance, the ecological and evolutionary conditions under which resistance to novel pathogens is maintained are still poorly understood. For instance, to what extent does the habitat matrix influence the maintenance of resistance through processes such as gene dilution? Does the de novo evolution of resistance independently across populations lead to epistatic interactions preventing widespread resistance? Resistance to sylvatic plague (caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis) has been observed in prairie dogs (genus Cynomys) in six western states, but resistance is still rare. This project integrates genomic and transcriptomic analysis of experimentally infected animals with rangewide spatiotemporal sampling to elucidate how, when and where resistance evolves, and what prevents this adaptive trait from sweeping to fixation. Previous experimental infections and a natural epizootic will be used to determine the genomic basis of resistance in two species. Alleles associated with resistance, along with neutral alleles serving as a null model, will be genotyped in latitudinal transects spanning populations with different plague introduction times, and in museum specimens from at least three distinct time ranges. These data will enable estimates of the rate of evolution of resistance alleles and inferences of the landscape spatial structure and genomic characteristics facilitating resistance. Understanding how adaptation persists across space and time can enable facilitated adaptation in imperiled systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Szostak from the Massachusetts General Hospital and Harvard University will study prebiotic chemistry relevant for the origin of life on the early Earth. The proposed work will focus on how primordial RNA molecules could have replicated without enzymes. This research focuses on how life is a natural phenomenon that can emerge according to the laws of chemistry and physics. Carrying out the proposed research will contribute to training the next generation of 21st century scientists in the fields of chemistry and chemical biology. The proposed experimental procedures will allow graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to acquire specialized training in a broad range of chemical methods including organic synthesis, reaction kinetics, structure determination by crystallography, mass spectrometry and NMR. The laboratory?s findings will be communicated to the broadest possible audience in response to the enormous public interest in the origin of life and the possibility that life may exist elsewhere in the Universe. This outreach will both engage and educate non-scientists in the value and power of evidence-based thinking. A broader appreciation of and respect for science would be an enormous societal benefit. <br/><br/>The proposed research will advance knowledge of prebiotic chemistry and the chemistry of RNA. The objectives are to understand how chemical energy could be harvested and used to drive replication, and the emergent behaviors of complex RNA systems that will lead to non-enzymatic replication. The experiments related to activation chemistry will explore how high-energy compounds resulting from exposure to UV light can drive the chemical activation of nucleotides and thus the non-enzymatic replication of RNA. The exploration of a new model for RNA replication will examine the possibility that life emerged from a very complex mixture of small RNA fragments, prior to the evolution of enzyme-catalyzed replication of long sequences such as viral RNA genomes or cellular DNA genomes. The use of modern sequencing technology will provide insight into how RNA copying and replication can be achieved continuously and accurately.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Focusing on the Red River of the North, which separates Minnesota and North Dakota, the investigators will compile data from tree-ring sequences of long-lived trees, timbers from historical buildings, and subfossil logs from alluvial deposits to produce a composite record that spans the last several centuries.  These records will facilitate more accurate estimates of the frequency and magnitude of floods prior to the 20th century.  The project will increase understanding of the factors that influence flooding over longer time periods, with surrogate records providing data for two or more times the duration of instrument-based flood records.  The historical extension of flood records is especially valuable for studying very large floods that occur infrequently.  New insights generated through this project can help to determine whether extreme floods on major river systems are becoming more common as natural and human-related factors change in river basins.  By demonstrating how natural sources of flood information can contribute to flood mitigation decisions prior to the construction of major infrastructure, this project will reposition paleoflood hydrology within the broader field of hazard preparedness.  The investigators will collaborate with U.S. Geological Survey staff at the Dakota Water Science Center to use paleoflood estimates in the assessment of future flood risks.  Project results will help those responsible for managing rivers as well as residents and decision makers to evaluate vulnerability to floods and to weigh the potential benefits of proposed infrastructure, such as the construction of a 36-mile, $1.7 billion diversion channel that would redirect floodwaters around the Fargo-Moorhead metropolitan area.<br/><br/>This project will determine how the extraordinary 1826 Red River flood documented downstream in Canada in historical accounts also affected the American stretch of the river.  Red River floods have caused more than $3.5 billion in direct damages to American communities over the past two decades and have spurred the construction or proposed construction of nearly $2.5 billion in flood mitigation infrastructure.  Because the known record of Red River floods only extends back to the late 19th century, other sources of information are needed to estimate the risks of future severe floods.  Using an analog approach to compare tree-ring evidence associated with recent major floods with known stage and discharges of older events only present in the tree-ring record, the investigators will produce estimates of the relative magnitudes of earlier floods.  For old trees that extend back into the early 19th century or earlier, the maximum stage of past floods will be inferred from the vertical position of anatomical abnormalities along the tree stem.  The new paleoflood record for the Red River will enable the investigators to answer questions regarding the synchrony of flooding along the entire reach of the river and to gauge how flooding on the northern Great Plains is related to variability in climate and other environmental factors at local and regional scales.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their performance depends on a variety of tuning decisions, determining how the system processes data internally. For lay users, it is very hard to find settings that optimize performance. This has motivated the creation of automated database tuning tools that try to find optimal settings for them. However, crucial information for database tuning is often available in the form of natural language text, including, for instance, the database manual, text documents describing data sets, as well as discussions on database-centric Internet forums. Currently, automated tools are unable to benefit from such text, making them inefficient. This project aims at creating automated database tuning tools that extract useful information for tuning from a variety of text documents. By increasing the quality of automated tuning tools, the project empowers lay users and reduces the need for highly specialized workers in industry, currently causing staff shortages and hampering the adoption of new technology. At the same time, the project aims at the creation of new teaching offerings, helping to educate the next generation of data professionals.<br/><br/><br/>The project is divided into two primary research thrusts, dedicated to the two categories of text documents that are most useful for database system tuning: text about data sets and text about database management systems. Transformer-based language models will be used to extract relevant information from such text documents. The resulting insights can be used in multiple ways for database tuning: to guide data profiling operations prior to tuning, to refine cost models used for tuning, or to restrict the search space of tuning choices. The project will explore all of those options, combining insights gained from text with other sources of information (e.g., trial runs that result in performance measurements for specific tuning choices). The project will consider a representative set of classical database tuning problems, including, for instance, the problem of selecting auxiliary index data structures to optimally support data processing, as well as the problem of finding optimal values for database system configuration parameters. All project outcomes will be integrated into a software package for automated database tuning, using text documents as input. This software will be released to the public.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The approach, inspired by echolocation used by bats, is to develop from sound alone 3D spatial maps that are sufficient for navigation, such as close obstacle avoidance and finding distant exits in a crowded train station.  The research will enable 3D vision beyond the line of sight and in low or no light conditions with applications ranging from listening cars that can hear pedestrians around the corner to collective 3D map reconstruction from crowds.  Project outcomes will contribute to better computational modeling of sound perception and effective sound-vision integration in robotics, as well as to impactful applications such as navigational aids for visually impaired persons and for fire-fighters in low visibility conditions caused by smoke or darkness.  The work will provide a complementary cost-effective alternative to visual 3D mapping that allows everybody to become a 3D content creator.<br/><br/>The task of 3D perception from sound is challenging.  While stereo audio provides direct cues for horizontal direction of arrival estimation, it only works in well controlled environments.  There are no simple mathematical models to map sound to 3D space in real-word settings, as many factors such as device orientations, room layouts, materials, background noises shape sound propagation.   This project takes a machine learning approach to infer 3D space from cell phone audios.  A large-scale audio-visual dataset will be collected in different environments using a sensor-rig with a binaural microphone, a speaker and an RGB-D stereo.  An attached smartphone will record time-synchronized data with its own stereo microphone and cameras. The speaker will emit signals to enable echolocation, but a part of the data will contain only naturally occurring sounds.  Several indoor and outdoor environments with LiDAR scanned 3D models will serve as ground-truth.  Data will also be collected in public streets to test robustness in realistic situations where LiDAR scans are not possible.  Given the dataset, several 3D scene reconstruction tasks will be formulated for both the field of view and full 360 view, first with privileged sensor data and finally from cellphone sensors alone.  After collecting large-scale audio-visual data in a variety of environments with binaural microphones and stereo cameras, a model will be trained to map sound data to depth maps extracted from visual data.  Once the model is trained, it will be able to ?see? the 3D space based on sound inputs alone.  The model will then be adapted to achieve the same high quality 3D perception with stereo-microphones and sensors available on a mobile phone.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the ocean, which sustains half of global photosynthesis and oxygen supply, P can be scarce enough to constrain biological productivity, carbon dioxide uptake, and therefore climate. Human activity is accelerating the delivery of nutrients like P to the ocean, but rates of nitrogen inputs are even greater. This imbalance may increase levels of P stress in marine ecosystems, placing ocean productivity more and more under the control of P supply. Given the critical role of P in sustaining ocean health and ecosystem services now and into the future, a comprehensive understanding of its utilization and fate in the marine environment is necessary. In this project, the research team investigates marine polyphosphate (polyP), a ubiquitous yet poorly understood form of P made by all living organisms. To close major knowledge gaps on marine polyP, the investigators are overcoming major technical barriers to produce the first quantitative measurements of polyP in marine microorganisms. These measurements are being conducted on laboratory microbial cultures, as well as field samples from environments with high P supply, such as the California Current Ecosystem, or very low P supply, such as the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, the research team is resolving the cellular function of marine polyP across these different organisms and environments in order to clarify its role in biological P nutrition. This work helps advance polyP research across disciplines, including terrestrial science and even cancer research, and has broad application to P bioremediation. This project supports a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and several undergraduate students in the labs of two female scientists. New educational tools to teach the public about marine polyP are being produced and disseminated through this project. A K12 teacher is participating in the work and communicating the findings to their classrooms and to broad audiences online.<br/><br/>PolyP is ubiquitous in marine systems, where it plays critical roles in microbial P nutrition and P mineral formation and sequestration. In these ways, polyP has the potential to shape long- and short-term marine P cycling, primary productivity, microbial ecology, and global climate. However, major knowledge gaps still exist. Due to technical limitations, the scientific community currently lacks a quantitative understanding of marine polyP pools, their chain lengths, and biological origins. Furthermore, given the view of polyP as a P storage molecule, recent observations pointing to the preferential retention of particulate polyP in low phosphate (Pi) environments raise new questions about its ecophysiological functions. To close these knowledge gaps, two research questions are addressed: Q1: What is the total content and chain length distribution of polyP across different microbial groups and environmental conditions? Q2: How do the production of particulate polyP contribute to microbial P demand and stoichiometry across a broad range in Pi availability? The following hypotheses are tested: H1 (Q1): Functionally and environmentally diverse plankton produce a broad range of polyP chain lengths and concentrations. H2 (Q2): The preferential retention of polyP in low Pi environments can be reconciled with its role as a P storage molecule by a combination of taxonomic and physiological factors. These hypotheses are tested in the laboratory using representative cultures of marine plankton and in the field using observational approaches along natural Pi gradients in the Pacific Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Applying a new P-targeted method using mass spectrometry, the team is resolving an unprecedented level of detail in marine polyP content and speciation. By combining cell sorting with elemental, biochemical, and radiotracer analyses, the team is gaining a mechanistic understanding of polyP physiology and its cycling in the ocean.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Biological Oceanography and Chemical Oceanography Programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Data collected for this project come from medical examiner and coroner offices from across the country, from warfare trauma of previous conflicts, and from experimental research. These data are analyzed with respect to demographic characteristics, trauma information (including location, type, and direction), and type and cause of blast. In addition, trauma details from comparative traumatic events are collected to further examine how blast events differ from other trauma events. Spatial and data analyses are used to assess spatial distribution patterns of trauma and trends in trauma event types.

Decades of research reveal the importance of foundation species for sustaining the biodiversity and ecosystem functions that underlie critical ecosystem services including water purification, storm protection, and food provision. Although foundation species commonly ameliorate stress, create habitat, and modify resource availability through their physical presence rather than their actions, and many foundation species remain as physical structures after death, we know surprising little about their ecological role after death. The research component of this project focuses on corals because of the conspicuous reef structures they leave behind after death and the value of these reef structures for the resilience and function of tropical coastal ecosystems. The education and outreach component of the project build academic capacity and a broad understanding of the importance of foundation species for coastal resilience among stakeholder groups in three ways: First, the project actively recruits teachers and high school students for workshops that involve trips to research sites and develops virtual precollege courses that connect students nationwide to researchers at the University of Florida. Second, the project promotes globalization for effective world citizens by leading University of Florida undergraduates in international research experiences at Caribbean field sites, and University of Florida graduate students in outreach activities with conservation NGOs in Panama. Third, the project improves retention and provides networking opportunities by fostering mentorship relationships and inviting students and teachers to participate in a regional marine science symposium.<br/><br/>Coastal ecosystems around the world are changing at an unprecedented rate due to local and global anthropogenic stressors. Among the most obvious and important changes are shifts in the composition of the dominant, habitat-forming organisms (known as foundation species) that define many ecosystems by driving patterns of biodiversity and ecosystem functions. Working in coral reefs, which have been a model system for exploring state shifts and ecosystem resilience, this project explores how dead foundation species play a pivotal role in determining whether and how communities recover from disturbance. The goals of the project are three-fold: (1) Explore the traits of dead corals and how they contrast with living corals, (2) Track the fate of dead coral in the seascape (i.e., return to coral or shift to novel ecosystem), and (3) Test how consumers mediate the role of dead coral in setting ecosystem trajectories. These goals are being pursued through an international research program that employs a complementary set of field surveys, experiments, and modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Realizing this vision calls for breakthroughs in energy efficiency, security and privacy technologies, and the integration of computing, communication, and sensing.  Current design practices are unlikely to yield these breakthroughs, as their siloed paradigm that coerces materials scientists, device engineers, computer architects, and algorithm designers to work in relative isolation from each other and across rigid interfaces has reached its limits.

This project addresses entrainment by building multimodal signal mapping interfaces that mediate interpersonal connections by deriving music from brain and body rhythms. The investigator will integrate sensor hardware and signal processing software to stream live brain and body data, perform calculations to extract signal characteristics, and use this to drive sound synthesis. A series of music cognition and listening experiments study physiological, behavioral, and affective entrainment phenomena, which are expected to result, from a series of multimodal brain music interfaces. A use-case study, developed in consultation with doctors, connects mothers and infants, physically separated by distance, using the multimodal entrainment interface. Mother and infant hear music derived from each other?s heartbeats and breathing. This study investigates the entrainment created in their body rhythms, and maps health and well-being effects of the virtual connection environment. For researchers, doctors, and caretakers, multimodal brain music interfaces have the potential to expand our scientific understanding of music?s beneficial effects on the brain and body, which may lead to new health and well-being interventions for adults, children, and infants. This project will result in an open-source tool kit of accessible technologies and STEM learning modules to inspire educators and students to develop projects that further our understanding of brain and body signals. These learning modules will be integrated into a summer research experience--involving high school students and their teachers--in which authentic learning encourages students? training in the scientific method through their natural interest in music. <br/><br/>This project develops and evaluates an interface with new multimodal signal mapping technologies that translate neurophysiological signals (e.g., EEG, ECG, EDA, respiration) into musical sound to promote biological, behavioral, and affective synchrony between individuals and computers by: (1) engineering sonification techniques that perform real-time signal processing and algorithmic music generation for transforming physiological signals into music; (2) investigating the neuropsychological mechanisms that govern auditory neurostimulation and physiological entrainment by designing new rhythmic auditory neurophysiological sonification stimuli and measuring how the human body responds; and (3) designing and evaluating a use case that involves co-generating music for infants and their mothers with each other?s physiological data. Quantitative data will address synchronies in physiology, protocol analysis of video will address behavioral synchronies, and qualitative data will address experiences.

The predominant model employed to capture diffusion is Fourier's law. However, this formulation prevents the simulation of anomalous diffusive processes, where diffusion occurs either faster (super-diffusion) or slower (sub-diffusion) than the rate predicted by Fourier's law. Currently, there is a need for efficiently simulating and visualizing super-diffusive phenomena, such as the super-spreader events for disease propagation witnessed during the COVID-19 pandemic or the melting of the permafrost due to global warming. This project will push the frontiers of physics simulation in computer graphics by developing a general framework for efficiently simulating all kinds of diffusive processes in large-scale applications, thereby enabling for example characterization of diffusion parameters that lead to specific experimental observations in the real world or the design of policies for preventing disease outbreaks in moving crowds. Project outcomes will have broad impact by supporting the visualization of such complex physical processes at greatly expanded scales. Additional broad impact will derive from the ability to run high resolution simulations on commodity workstations, which will allow a broad audience, particularly students in STEM, to simulate large-scale problems on their own workstations that previously may have required less-accessible enterprise-grade computational resources. Outreach and  educational activities such as workshops will leverage diversity programs at Rutgers University to recruit and support students from under-represented groups.<br/><br/>This project will advance the state-of-the-art in computer graphics by developing a novel formulation for diffusion using fractional derivatives that can not only simulate sub- and super-diffusive processes but also recover the efficiency of the best-known solvers for traditional Fourier-based diffusion. A hybrid Lagrangian/Eulerian representation will be adopted for modeling both micro- and macroscopic interactions, the two being strongly coupled together while accounting for discontinuities such as cracks that may emerge. To scale to large problem sizes, an adaptive discretization scheme will be developed using spatial polynomial regions that can flexibly represent the diffusion fluxes in any irregular domain of arbitrary shape using polynomial functions. For fast numerical solutions, this project will develop an efficient solver using Multigrid methods that better utilize the hardware memory bandwidth by avoiding construction of the linear system while leading to fast convergence rates on modern workstations. The resulting framework will allow the simulation of diffusive phenomena such as super-diffusion that have either not been explored in computer graphics or are currently beyond the reach of existing methods. Implementations of the proposed methodology will be made available to the community as open-source software packages, along with a lightweight client that supports interactive user feedback from the browser while the computationally intensive simulation runs on a remote server thereby making this research broadly accessible, in particular to undergraduate and K-12 students, to cultivate their early interest in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While changes in land use, poor maintenance records, expensive upgrades, and aging structures have long plagued dam management, climate change heightens the threat of unexpected flooding. Despite the increasing risks of dam failures, insufficient public funding for proactively managing dam safety and highly variable state level dam safety regulations add precarity to the future of dams. For local governments, the burden of dam management gets added to other infrastructural and community needs, and they are forced to make difficult tradeoffs between dam-related community benefits, such as flood control and water storage, and dam failure risks that threaten communities downstream. The fundamental issue at the center of this research is what factors motivate local governments to take action relative to local governments in comparable situations who opt not to act. This study addresses a gap in the literature and helps dam managers and state regulators improve proactive and climate-responsive dam management. As the potential dangers of dam failure increase with climate change, the findings from this research inform policies and planning to reduce failure risks and and to improve decision making strategies for dam management. <br/><br/>The authors examine the factors that lead local governments to proactively manage their aging and failing dams. This study consists of two phases. Phase one is a survey of 1,205 local government dam managers in all 50 states who have acted or have not acted to reduce risks of failures. Phase two involves two cases and two controls to qualitatively examine the contextual and procedural factors in depth.

Glycomaterials also play important roles in biology including immune response, cell-to-cell communication and as a fundamental component of DNA. Nonetheless, understanding these materials has historically been challenging because their chemical structures are complex and resistant to standard methods of characterization.

Social network analysis is used to study the structure and dynamics of interactions among social actors at a variety of scales. Network methods provide a means to study the relations between entities and how those relations affect outcomes. The usefulness of this approach in archaeology is attested by its rapid adoption, yet there remain substantial questions regarding the fundamental nature of the material culture networks used as proxies for social networks. Archaeologists typically use similarities between types of artifacts as a proxy for the probability that social groups interacted in the past. But what type of interaction is represented by similarities in ceramic pots? Is it the same type of interaction as that represented by similarities in arrowheads? This dissertation research is designed to answer these questions using multilayer network analysis. This form of analysis handles multiple networks in at once, which will allow the researcher to conduct a study comparing many types of material culture using data from the Western Pueblo Region of the Southwest United States between AD 1150 and AD 1500. This region has an excellent chronological record and archaeological coverage, which makes it an ideal area to test the efficacy of using material culture networks as proxies for social networks. By determining how different material culture networks correlate with each other, this research will inform the broader archaeological community regarding the ways different types of material culture may or may not reveal different aspects of past social networks. Furthermore, this study will be the first to formally explore the network trajectories of communities across a period of rapid social-organizational change in the Western Pueblo region. The research also involves significant collaboration with the living descendants of the ancient inhabitants of the Western Pueblo region who will provide native interpretations of the results of this study.<br/> <br/>The first portion of the study involves archival research documenting thousands of projectile points across the Western Pueblo region. Images will be obtained of each projectile point for use in a geometric morphometric analysis that uses homologous landmarks on each projectile point to mathematically compare similarities in outlines. A smaller sample of projectile points will also be scanned in 3D to compare the entire surface of the point to make a more detailed comparison. The second portion of the study combines the projectile point analysis with existing databases on ceramics, architectural features, and geochemically sourced obsidian and ceramics. These data will be converted into material culture networks used to represent ancient social networks. The networks will then be analyzed using standard multilayer and individual network analysis methods to compare the differences between them and to examine the trajectory of change throughout the Western Pueblo region.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellites, and reconnaissance cameras lack stereo information causing 3D reconstruction and depth estimation to fail.  Turbulence caused by air and water also causes light rays to deflect from their original path and introduces noticeable motion artifacts like blurriness and distortion.  This project develops a generalizable motion field estimator using neural networks coupled with specific hardware settings to enhance computer vision tasks in long-range imaging. Successful development of such a motion field estimator can enable applications of computer vision systems at long distances and/or under turbulent environments including UAV navigation, object tracking and detection, and long-range monitoring. The project has broader impact in industrial applications which leverage such technologies. In addition, research results will be integrated into new course materials for physics-informed computer vision and computational photography classes. The project will provide training to underrepresented students and outreach to K-12 students throughout its duration. <br/><br/>This project will develop computational solutions to decouple the entangled motion fields and use turbulence motion to enhance visual computing applications in long-range imaging. This research is motivated by the observation that turbulence-induced motion fields can provide depth and sub-pixel color information, which is crucial in restoring scenes with high-frequency details. To achieve this goal, the project will pursue three research thrusts: 1) neural field decoupling of object and turbulence motion; 2) reconstructing turbulence strength and flows from passive visual imagery; and 3) motion field guided intelligent foveation for long-range imaging. The first thrust will develop algorithms for estimating and recovering motion fields with both object and turbulence motion by investigating physics-based velocity fields. The second thrust will develop tractable quantitative turbulence motion models that can be applied to both air and water environments using deep neural networks. The third thrust will integrate the turbulence motion field into different visual computing pipelines to benefit long-range computer vision tasks.

This is what many survivors of head and neck cancers and patients with Sjgren?s syndrome, a particular type of autoimmune disease, experience every day: persistent dry mouth. Scientists know that dry mouth is often associated with over-accumulation of interstitial fibrous proteins, a hallmark of tissue fibrosis. However, how the fibrotic environment causes permanent damage to the acinar cells, the saliva producing cells, is not understood. The goal of this project is to develop a lab-grown salivary gland tissue model using artificial matrices created employing highly efficient chemical reactions. Epithelial cells isolated from salivary gland and stromal cells isolated from the supporting connective tissue will be used to build the model. The model will be comprised of spherical epithelial entities held together through cell-cell recognition and individual stromal cells dispersed in the engineered matrix. The living tissue will be subjected to additional chemical transformations to alter its makeup and rigidity, which will convert the healthy stromal cells to abnormal cells with the ability to contract the tissue and deposit excessive fibrous proteins. We will analyze how these changes make epithelial cells cease to produce saliva. Using the engineered tissue model, we will evaluate the potential of therapeutic interventions to reverse fibrosis and restore the secretory function. Integrated with the research effort is an educational plan to engage and empower pre-service, early childhood teachers who will inspire the next generation of scientists. A series of hands-on exhibits, teaching modules, and makers lab activities will be created to prepare students for careers in materials science and biomedical engineering.<br/><br/><br/>Technical description <br/><br/>Despite advances in treatment strategies, xerostomia (or dry mouth) remains a permanent and devastating disease that broadly affects patients with head and neck malignancies or the Sjgren?s syndrome. Although it is well accepted that the loss of secretory acini is the root cause of xerostomia, there is accumulating evidence underlying the importance of tissue fibrosis in contributing to and sustaining the disease. This application capitalizes on our recent innovations in bioorthogonal chemistry, materials synthesis, and tissue engineering to construct a physiologically relevant tissue model with integrated epithelial and mesenchymal cells, allowing in situ perturbation of the extracellular environment to simulate salivary gland fibrosis due to radiation injury or an aberrant immune system. The proposed model will be comprised of multicellular epithelial assemblies and individual mesenchymal stem cells in a customized synthetic matrix, whose composition and properties can be dynamically tuned to induce fibrogenesis. Using this model, we will investigate how the normal mesenchyme maintains tissue homeostasis, how the fibrotic microenvironment alters the phenotype and organization of the epithelial cells, and whether therapies targeting tissue fibrosis can lead to the restoration of the secretory function. The proposed research activity will not only contribute to the education of the next generation of scientists and engineers, but also empower early childhood teachers. Concerted efforts will be dedicated to the creation of discovery-based teaching methods, lab-based research modules and community-based design and innovation activities. The interdisciplinary nature of the proposed research and educational efforts will also equip graduate students with up-to-date information, experimental skills, and creative thinking that are all indispensable in maintaining the United States? global competitiveness.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whereas objects are composed of tangible substances such as wood, glass or metal, our perceptions of them are based on patterns of light. Thus, an adequate theory of perception must be able to explain how patterns of light can uniquely specify the 3D structure of the visual environment. This research project will study the visual perception of object shape, with a focus on understanding how the human visual system processes and interprets information about the three-dimensional properties of objects. A better understanding of 3D vision could provide many practical applications. For example, it could lead to dramatic improvements in the design of visually guided robots or autonomous vehicles. It could also be important for building prosthetic devices for the blind to avoid potential obstacles during locomotion or to detect the presence of slippery surfaces that create a danger of falling.<br/><br/>The computational analysis of 3D shape from shading has been studied for over 50 years but despite the broad interdisciplinary scope it has had relatively minimal success. One possible reason is that researchers have typically simplified the problem by making unrealistic assumptions about how light behaves in the natural environment. This makes it easier to derive mathematical solutions, but severely limits the generality of the resulting analyses. In the present work, the investigators will include many of the optical effects that have typically been ignored in this domain, including cast shadows, surface inter-reflections, anisotropic reflections, light transmission, and multiple patterns of illumination. They will also perform detailed measurements of the luminance field in each condition to discover properties that are relatively invariant over changes in scene parameters. The work will focus primarily on qualitative surface features, such as bumps, dimples, ridges, valleys, and saddles, and how they correspond to similar qualitative patterns of image shading. Numerous psychophysical experiments will be conducted to document 1) how observers? judgments of 3D surface structure are influenced by the pattern of image shading; 2) the stability of these judgments over changes in surface materials and patterns of illumination; and 3) how smooth variations of light intensity on the eye provide information about 3D shape, even when all other aspects of shading have been removed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Predicting and managing energy demand are crucial tasks for addressing climate change and other environmental impacts of energy use. The mainstream models of energy demand are reductionist, dividing demand into separate categories such as residential, commercial, and transportation, and analyzing each separately. This research will develop a holistic model of energy demand, one that considers how consumer actions affect multiple sectors at the same time, including residences, vehicles, commercial buildings, server/data networks, and the production of purchased goods. The model includes consumer ownership and use of energy- consuming technologies such as vehicles or home furnaces, and accounts for how people use time and spend money. The new model will be constructed for the U.S. by integrating government micro-data on consumer behavior (American Time Use Survey, Residential Energy Consumption Survey, National Household Travel Survey, Consumer Expenditure Survey), using modern data analysis methods to integrate them. The integrated dataset will provide information about energy device ownership and use, internet use, time spent in commercial buildings, and expenditures on goods. A set of models will map these consumer attributes to energy use and carbon emissions. For commercial buildings, a regression model will be built that links the area of different building types with consumers? and employees? use of them. An Economic Input Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIOLCA) will estimate the energy use and emissions from consumer expenditures. The holistic model will help understanding of the broader effects of demand interventions. For example, how are the carbon benefits of electric vehicles affected by induced changes in consumer purchases and activity choices? The model will help assess the effect of behavioral changes not typically considered in policy (e.g. encouraging telework), and thus could broaden the scope of policy options considered. <br/><br/>The model advances the state of energy demand modeling on a number of fronts. First, the model combines data on personal expenditures, time, and technology use to provide a household-level estimate of life cycle carbon emissions, accounting for energy use in residences, commercial buildings, servers/networks, transportation, and manufacturing of goods. Part of the contribution is in integrating existing models into a larger holistic framework. Missing modeling elements will be developed, in particular linking consumers? use of commercial buildings to energy demand, and attributing use of information technology to energy demand in data networks and servers. In methods, the research develops a new approach for assessing how change in time use of a given activity (e.g. shift from driving to biking) leads to changes in other activities as well as the overall energy use from the primary shift in activity. The research involves merging multiple data sources on consumers via representative populations, and this dataset will be made publicly available. Outreach activities include a workshop with energy efficiency modelers and policy advocates, development of an energy demand game, and a summer camp for high school students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The database is utilized extensively by the research community to study phenomena of interest to a variety of fields, including psychology, computer science, and economics. Human faces offer a rich source of information and are critically important as people navigate the social world. Babies enter the world ready to orient and attend to human faces. By adulthood, humans learn to prioritize the features that allow for the rapid categorization of others by sex, age, and race. People infer a large number of psychologically meaningful attributes about others based on facial features. Effectively studying face processing and its downstream effects on human behavior requires high-quality, valid stimuli. This project expands, enhances and makes available such stimuli to researchers. By improving the Chicago Face Database, this project promotes better scientific practices, helps researchers test new and different questions, pursues basic science questions, and trains historically underrepresented students in the sciences.<br/><br/>The Chicago Face Database currently includes digital images of over 800 Asian, Black, Latinx, multiracial, and White Americans and South Asian Indians. It also includes important ratings and physical measures of the faces. The Chicago Face Database was designed to fill a significant research need: providing high-quality and diverse face stimuli to researchers at no cost. Since being released in 2015, the Chicago Face Database has been downloaded over 8,000 times and cited over 1,400 times, affirming its value to the scientific community. The current project expands and diversifies the Chicago Face Database to include 200 additional images of people photographed in China and Japan, update the subjective ratings of the faces, provide more comprehensive measurements of the faces, and design new web-based tools for accessing the resource and facilitating stimulus selection. In accomplishing these goals, the project addresses basic science questions related to the cross-race recognition deficit, a psychological phenomenon whereby people show better recognition for faces belonging to their own race than to other races. In addition, a high-impact, hands-on mentoring program is offered to historically underrepresented students pursuing computer science. The students receive professional development coaching and individualized mentoring as they work closely with a computer scientist in the development of the web-based tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, neurodivergent youth often do not have access to learning environments in which they can reflect on their cognitive strengths and identify them as offering critical skills and valuable contributions to the future STEM workforce and to society. To increase access to this type of learning environment, this project will develop and test a suite of materials for makerspaces, including curricula and facilitator guides, called NeuroVivid. NeuroVivid will provide neurodiverse youth with opportunities to build simple electroencephalogram (EEG) headsets using low-cost and widely available materials; to view and interpret data related to their brain activity; and to interact with these data in playful ways. As examples, youth can use sensor data to play music, control robots, or operate simple machines. Within this context, neurodivergent youth will learn about neuroscience with a focus on neuroplasticity and cognitive assets. NeuroVivid will be iteratively co-developed and tested with makerspace facilitators and with approximately 85 racially, ethnically, and socioeconomically diverse and neurodivergent youth (age 10 to 14). Research will explore which design elements are essential for brain-computer interface (BCI) learning materials that enhance neurodivergent youths? interest in STEM, with a particular focus on their interest in BCI careers. This empirical research, as well as the NeuroVivid materials, will be disseminated widely through makerspace networks as well as through educational research venues. This project is funded by the Innovative Technology Experiences for Students and Teachers (ITEST) program, which supports projects that build understandings of practices, program elements, contexts and processes contributing to increasing students' knowledge and interest in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) and information and communication technology (ICT) careers.<br/><br/>This project will result in a suite of maker curricula and materials, titled NeuroVivid, intended to counter deficit models of cognitive differences through highlighting the cognitive assets of neurodivergent youth. Youth will be selected to co-develop and use these materials, as they work collaboratively with the project team and with makerspace facilitators, if they score in the bottom quartile on an amalgamation of the following four tasks related to executive functioning: n-back task (associated with working memory); flanker task (associated with visual attention); go/no-go task (associated with inhibition control); and a card sort task (associated with cognitive flexibility). The research team will use mixed methods research to identify the design elements that are essential to BCI learning materials that build interest in STEM among neurodivergent learners. This research will also explore how intersections of race/ethnicity, gender, and neurodivergence affect the development of interests and identities in STEM in the context of this curriculum. To achieve these research purposes, a neurodiverse project team will generate data sources such as transcripts from interviews and focus groups from racially and ethnically diverse youth who participate in NeuroVivid. Pre- and post-surveys that measure STEM interests and identities will also provide indicators as to NeuroVivid?s effectiveness among neurodivergent youth. NeuroVivid will be disseminated widely through digital platforms and conferences used or attended by makerspace personnel. Ultimately, this project will advance practice in makerspaces through generating knowledge about how these spaces can more explicitly affirm a broader range of cognitive strengths, while increasing neurodivergent youths? interest in STEM careers of the future.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, very little is known about the transport of mass momentum, heat and associated drag occurring in flows over ground-elevated surface roughness, named e-type roughness. This is critical for numerous engineering applications and of particular interest in solar photovoltaics. This is because convective cooling plays a critical role in controlling solar photovoltaics efficiency, and accounting for the right wind loads is important when designing new installations. The goal of this project is to investigate how different spatial arrangements of the ground-elevated surface roughness control mixing processes and flow structures in the flow. The ultimate question is whether it is possible to manipulate the mixing and drag characteristics in the flow through the proposed arrangements. Results of this project will enhance solar photovoltaics energy harvesting efficiency, thereby directly impacting the solar energy community and helping transition the U.S. into meeting the goal of becoming carbon neutral in a shorter period of time. The project will also encompass significant educational activities, including summer exchange programs for the graduate students, training on how to effectively communicate science content to the general public, and the development of training videos for the solar energy community.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop new understanding about mixing processes that result from the perturbations induced by ground-elevated (e-type) surface roughness and thermal spanwise heterogeneities. The scientific outcomes of this research will include enhancement of the current knowledge related to mixing processes over complex surfaces taking place when both turbulence and thermal forcings are simultaneously present and development of new scaling relations that include the effect of heated and non-heated photovoltaics-inspired ground-elevated surface roughness elements. The objectives of this project will be fulfilled through a synergistic effort including innovative high-resolution large-eddy simulations (LES) and particle image velocimetry in scaled wind tunnel experiments. The wind tunnel experiments will provide instantaneous velocity fields which will be used to compute the budget of vorticity, thus quantifying the momentum exchanges. The LES will also provide the instantaneous temperature fields which will also contribute to the balance, accounting for thermal effects. This analysis will facilitate understanding the factors contributing to the formation of secondary circulations in elevated roughness elements. In addition to the new understanding that will be developed in fluid mechanics, the proposed research will also yield critical information to guide the design of future solar photovoltaic farms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

WinCompTop 3 is a workshop that facilitates the formation of new and lasting research collaborations between junior and senior women working in the field of computational topology, a field that seeks to identify underlying patterns and mathematical structure in data from areas ranging from medical imaging to networks of sensor arrays. This workshop is designed to grow the network of women active in this field by providing both research opportunities and a unique environment for mentoring, collaboration, and cohort building. This type of event is critical, since despite numerous initiatives and undeniable progress over the past few decades, gender imbalance in mathematics and computer science remains significant. In particular, mathematics and computer science are two of three disciplines with the lowest percentage of women attaining PhDs, according to recent data collected by the National Science Foundation. There is considerable evidence that conferences and workshops, such as WinCompTop, geared toward women can and do make a significant impact, and participants report that they see strong benefits from these workshops, which support collaborations, broaden contacts, and raise visibility in the greater mathematical community.<br/><br/>The WinCompTop 3 workshop fits under the broad umbrella of Research Collaboration Conferences for Women, which the Association for Women in Mathematics encourages and supports. The majority of the time at the workshop will be spent tackling open problems in small working groups headed by established leaders in the field. The schedule consists of long blocks of time for the working groups to do research. At two or more points during the week, all participants will convene and one member from each group will provide a brief summary of their team's progress. In addition, there will be a poster session for graduate students and early-career participants, as well as other crucial networking and mentoring opportunities between women at different points in their career as well as between peer colleagues. These relationships will foster a supportive and community-oriented atmosphere that is ideal for generating professional connections and collaborations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Of all ancient taxa regarded as living relics, cycads are particularly notable because recent evidence suggests extant cycads may not be relics at all, but instead evolved during the Neogene period (~20My ago). This time period was characterized by declining temperatures, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and the expansion of arid regions. This research asks whether Neogene climate change drove the diversification of cycads as they evolved their anatomy and physiology in response to the new conditions. This integrative approach that spans from cells to whole plants will provide a novel perspective on cycad evolution and test whether this ancient lineage experienced concurrent and parallel evolution on multiple continents hundreds of millions of years after the origin of cycads. The proposed work is especially critical because cycads are among the most endangered plant groups on Earth, with ~70% of species threatened with extinction, primarily due to habitat destruction and poaching. Perhaps no other lineage of plants disappearing at such an alarming rate can provide as unique an opportunity to examine one of the earliest experiments of seed plant evolution, and our results will directly inform conservation practices. This project will provide research experiences for graduate students and undergraduates at University of Wisconsin-Madison and Florida International University, one of the nation's largest Hispanic Serving Institutions, as well as research-driven field courses for undergraduates.   <br/><br/>This research will uncover the ecological and evolutionary processes that have generated the extant diversity of one of the oldest and most unusual groups of seed plants, the cycads. To determine whether Neogene diversification of cycads was enabled by adaptive trait evolution, the project will: (A) characterize the diversity of cycad anatomical traits (e.g. anatomical traits of stomata, bundle sheath extensions, transfusion tissue, and xylem) and test their impacts on gas exchange and hydraulic responses to abiotic conditions (e.g. light, CO2, VPD, drought), (B) test whether these anatomical and physiological traits are linked to species? distributions in climate space, and (C) determine whether the timing and order of trait evolution corresponded to Neogene climate change. By leveraging the unusual anatomical trait combinations exhibited by cycads, this research may have far reaching impacts in plant physiology, ecology, and evolution by: (A) revealing the significance of anatomical traits with poorly known function(s) that are also found in other plant groups (e.g., bundle sheath extensions, transfusion tissue), (B) characterizing the function of trait combinations that are exceptionally rare among extant plants but commonly found in extinct taxa (e.g., tracheids and homogeneous pits) thus allowing new insight into the function of extinct lineages and better contextualizing the sequence of physiological trait evolution in vascular plants, and (C) testing long-standing hypotheses about the repeatability and predictability of evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

One particularly promising renewable energy technology is metal halide perovskite (MHP)-based photovoltaics, which can provide lightweight, low-cost power sources for commercial and residential, disaster relief, military, and space applications. MHPs exhibit similar efficiencies to more established technologies such as silicon photovoltaics, but with lower production cost and waste. However, MHPs have intrinsic mechanical and chemical instabilities that currently prevent commercial viability. This project will be focused on addressing these instabilities through developing an understanding of how stresses that form in the MHPs during fabrication influence performance and stability, and how these effects can be mitigated through directed growth or stress modulation by using organic ligands (or additives). The fundamental scientific knowledge produced by this project will benefit society by elucidating the relationship between lattice strain, stability, and performance in solution-processable organic-inorganic hybrid materials, which can be used to reduce the material use and cost, improving access to renewable energy. In parallel, we will develop and present ?research readiness? seminars for marginalized students via established University of Arizona programs. In these seminars, we will also launch a new video outreach pilot program?Scientists Like Me?designed to increase self-concept as a researcher in these communities. Finally, we will build upon these interrelated efforts to inform curriculum development for a cornerstone course for the first of its kind Renewable Energy Science and Engineering minor?which will accelerate the dissemination of this knowledge to our communities and help train a more diverse workforce for renewable energy.<br/>This project will utilize organic molecules to control lattice strain in metal halide perovskites to modulate the optoelectronic behavior of these systems. In particular, we will focus on three interrelated questions: (1) How do lattice strain gradients influence defect migration and localization? (2) How does the molecular structure of additives in perovskite inks affect nucleation, growth, and orientation of crystallites? and (3) How can the molecular structure of additives influence lattice strains in perovskites? Successfully answering these questions will be a significant step towards realizing scalable production of stable high-performance solution-processable devices, enabling low-cost and transformative applications such as renewable energy, energy-efficient lighting and displays, and portable and wearable sensors for health care. We will synergistically use benchtop and computational experiments to inform research pathways and build towards a goal of understanding how molecular additives and their interactions at MHP surfaces can influence stability and performance through strain modulation. Furthermore, we will develop broad design rules for additive selection based on specific chemistries and stoichiometries of a range of perovskite compositions. The need for these broad design rules has become increasingly important given the ever-expanding library of metal halide perovskite compositions, each with their own complex and varied surface chemistries. Finally, we will implement a new strategy to improve the stability and performance of perovskite devices by informed design and selection of molecular additives to modulate the film stresses to control defect migration, charge transport, and band gap.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The different shapes of different species are due to differences in the relative growth of body parts. Although much is known about how growth is controlled, little is known about the mechanisms that cause growth to stop when an animal reaches a species-specific size. How a growing animal assesses its body size is not known for any vertebrate, but is beginning to be understood in insects. The goal of the research is to expand upon recent discoveries about the mechanisms by which insects sense their body size, and to investigate how those lead to the cessation of growth. The project also investigates the mechanism by which insect wings grow in correct proportion to body size, using giant and dwarf genetic strains, as well as species that differ in body and wing size. The control of wing size involves signals emanating from the body wall muscles that control precisely for how long wings grow. This research will, for the first time, provide a detailed explanation of the difficult problem of how insects monitor and control their body size. The award supports training for college and high school students, as well as high school teachers in STEM fields, in physiological research, data analysis and presentation. <br/><br/>The project tests hypotheses based on several recent discoveries about the physiological mechanisms by which insects sense their body size, and how those lead to the cessation of growth. Aim 1 investigates the mechanism that controls the size at which a growing larva molts to the next instar. This is called the critical weight, which is defined by the non-growing tracheal system that triggers the molt to the next larger instar when it is no longer able to supply sufficient oxygen to the ever-growing body. This trigger induces the secretion of the hormone ecdysone, which causes a molt to the next larger instar. Aim 2 investigates the mechanism that assesses the size of an instar and determines whether the next molt stops growth and initiates metamorphosis. This is called the threshold size, which is defined by the rise in myoglianin, a protein from muscles of the body wall, that causes the decline of juvenile hormone, that, in turn, triggers a pulse of ecdysone secretion, stopping growth altogether. Aim 3 investigates the mechanism by which wings grow to the correct proportion to body size. This is a special problem because wings do not begin to grow until after feeding and somatic growth have stopped. Body size after growth stops is also measured by myoglianin levels, which control the duration and level of ecdysone secretion, controlling the rate and duration of cell division in the wing so that the wing grows in correct proportion to body size. Graduate and undergraduate students and high school students and teachers will contribute to the research, contributing to STEM workforce development at multiple levels. The research team will also contribute to public education activities at local children?s museums.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project reconstructs both the cultural and environmental history at a coastal archaeological site and then place the site within the broader archaeological history of the region. In this region a prolonged drought followed by catastrophic flooding caused the abandonment and reduction of coastal populations. To date, research on this region has focused on societal collapse due to environmental change. In contrast, this project acknowledges the challenges associated with climatic changes, while also emphasizing the ingenuity of people in unpredictable landscapes. Archaeology is particularly well placed to continue research on this drought and flood event, while putting it within the broader context of cultural adaptation and change. The project provides localized environmental data on what coastal peoples experienced over a ca. 300 year period. Additionally, it adds to the archaeological knowledge of landscape use and reuse in an area with an extended period of human history. The project focuses on professionalization and training of members of an international research team that will further disseminate their research on these topics.<br/><br/>This project focuses on a period of major environmental and cultural changes. Though research has been done at other sites to understand the impact of the coastal drought and flood, this project is the first regional scale analysis of this period of regional  prehistory. Specifically, the research addresses two main questions: How did coastal peoples adapt to unpredictable climate conditions? And what was the collective impact of the drought and El Nio floods on the coast? To answer these questions the research team uses a combination of archaeological, geological, and biological research methods. The researcher leads a team of archaeologists, geoarchaeologists, and palynologists (pollen analysts) to conduct archaeological excavations, artifact analysis, sediment sampling and analysis, and pollen sampling and analysis. These interdisciplinary researchers address the convergence of environmental and human forces to understand agricultural and irrigational adaptations that allowed people to be resilient following these climate disasters.

However, obtaining sufficient volumes of such data is challenging in many areas because most high-value data is sensitive, and is owned by and split across multiple organizations. Organizations often cannot share the data they own due to privacy concerns, regulatory policies, and/or business competition. A promising solution is secure multiparty computation (MPC), a cryptographic technique that allows organizations to run complex computations on their joint dataset without revealing sensitive inputs to other parties. Unfortunately, developing efficient protocols remains a labor-intensive process that requires cryptographic expertise and is out of reach for most users and developers. The project's broader significance and importance are to accelerate and democratize the adoption of MPC by designing and building an end-to-end, integrated compiler-runtime framework that automatically generates and executes optimized, workload-specific MPC protocols. The project?s novelties are to build such a framework by developing and combining new insights from compilers, cryptography, and distributed systems. <br/><br/><br/>The team of researchers plan to address the research question in three broad thrusts. The first thrust develops the foundation of the platform by supporting a basic compilation infrastructure that is extensible to a wide variety of MPC primitives. The second thrust designs novel techniques for the compiler to generate workload-specific MPC protocols for user-provided high-level programs.

How does magma build up beneath active volcanoes, and how long does it take to do so? What controls whether it erupts or cools deep underground to form plutons? How long does it stay molten there, and how much of it is eruptible for how long? Hundreds of millions of people live within 100 miles of active volcanoes. They are at risk of being exposed to volcanic hazards. Volcanic eruptions also affect climate and the environment. Yet decades of research have not answered some of these basic questions. This project will address these questions in the Tuolumne pluton. It is home to the spectacular rock exposures of Yosemite National Park. Uranium-lead age dates of small minerals will determine when the plutons cooled to the rocks that are exposed at the surface today. They will also reveal the duration of time that magma was present. Additionally these much smaller minerals are found included in several-inch-large potassium feldspar crystals. The chemistry of the feldspars serves like fingerprints in a crime scene. They will determine when, where and how much magma was stored 90 million years ago to feed volcanic eruptions. How sticky and hot magma was will help determine what these eruptions might have looked like. This project supports two research groups: 1) Researcher Memeti, a woman at Hispanic-serving, undergraduate-focused California State University Fullerton, and 2) Researcher Schoene at research-focused Princeton University. The team will train several graduate students in age dating and chemistry methods. Graduate students help train undergraduate students involved in different parts of the project. All students take part in all aspects of research activities including field work and publishing. Memeti will complete following activities: 1) update authored Yosemite audiotour mobile app based on this project?s results, 2) continue to organize field trips to Yosemite National Park, and 3) share research results with park rangers. 4) She will develop introductory geology labs for geology students, and 5) continue her outreach efforts on volcanic hazards at southern California public events. Schoene will teach local K-12 teachers on volcanoes and hazards in a seminar at Princeton University. <br/><br/><br/>This 3-yr collaborative RUI project between California State University Fullerton and Princeton University seeks to determine the time and length scales of magma bodies in magmatic arcs and their changes in composition, crystallinity, and volume over time. The study will use K-feldspar pheno- and megacrysts up to 12 cm long and megacryst-hosted mineral inclusions from the Half Dome and Cathedral Peak units of the 95-85.5 Ma Tuolumne intrusive complex in the central Sierra Nevada. K-feldspar textures and zoning will be imaged in 3D with CT scans and CL images and quantitatively analyzed with electron microprobe and laser ablation ICPMS for geochemistry. K-feldspar mineral inclusions will be measured for TIMS-TEA U-Pb zircon and titanite geochronology, SIMS Ti-in-zircon and Zr-in-titanite thermometry, and EMP and LA-ICPMS plagioclase and hornblende thermometry and chemometry (determining melt compositions). These data will be synthesized to test the hypotheses that the Tuolumne intrusive complex matured thermally during incremental construction, creating interconnected magma bodies many kilometers in length, capable of magma flow, fractionation, mixing, and likely eruption. These data will reflect on current debates about whether long-lived and large composite intrusions like the Tuolumne complex are characterized by ?hot? or ?cold? storage. ?Cold? storage is characterized by small, rigid magma mushes that spend most of their time at temperatures near or at the solidus, limiting interaction with coeval magma bodies, only occasionally, if ever, ?defrosting? by magma recharge to feed volcanic eruptions. In contrast, ?hot storage? allows for dynamic inter-unit magma mixing and crystal recycling in large (10-100s of square kilometers) magma bodies at significantly higher temperatures above the solidus and lower crystallinities and at time scales of up to millions of years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A common teaching challenge is how best to support students when they are stuck on a mathematics problem in a homework assignment. When the goal is to support productive struggle and not just provide the correct answer, it is not always clear how much support should be provided. An existing free web-based platform allows teachers and researchers to author questions and solution step supports, and it makes student action data available to instructors and researchers. Previous research results on the use of this platform to support student learning and the use of formative feedback in instruction in secondary school classrooms was promising. Given the potential of the platform as a useful pedagogical tool in those settings, this project aims to adapt the platform for use at the undergraduate level, where research indicates the need for such supports in introductory level mathematics and statistics courses. Understanding how the technological supports provided to college students as they complete mathematics problems impacts student learning and confidence will provide important insights for the design and implementation of educational materials broadly.<br/><br/>By adapting prior studies, this project seeks to determine whether the use of an existing online platform for formative assessment of student work at the college level leads to similar gains in mathematics learning and analogous changes in pedagogical practices as has been reported at the middle school and high school levels. Over 100 randomized control trials have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of supports provided through the ASSISTments platform, but these have primarily occurred at levels of schooling prior to the undergraduate years. This project aims to determine whether the use of the platform at the college level leads to similar gains in learning and analogous changes in pedagogical practices. This will be accomplished by replicating studies at the college level which have been shown in the literature to be ?Best So Far? supports ? those supports which have significantly impacted student learning the most. To accomplish this, the project has four main aims. First is to support scalability by adding a feature to the platform which allows for the uploading of questions and solutions from the learning management system Canvas, thus creating a database of at least 500 problems aligned with college algebra, precalculus, calculus, and statistics curricula. A second aim is to design questions and feedback to improve student understanding and help them complete math homework problems, by creating 16 classroom-ready assignments on common topics in college algebra. Third is to use the platform in college mathematics courses and measure its impact on student learning, and persistence in STEM majors, thus generating large and rich datasets containing student actions within the platform. The fourth and final project aim is to track system usage by instructors during the semester, i.e., while problems are assigned and immediately after the due date, and also the persistence of system usage from semester-to-semester. Project results will be disseminated through the Open Science Framework and the platform?s website. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These microorganisms use inorganic nitrogen (N) from the water to make a variety of amino acids. Some of the amino acids keep the initial chemical signature (i.e., N isotope value) of their N source. Other amino acids are involved in metabolic processes that change the initial chemical signature (N isotope value). These distinct N isotope signatures are passed along to organisms that consume phytoplankton and throughout the food web. Thus, the N isotope values of individual amino acids can be used to obtain the isotope value of N sources supporting food webs and to estimate the trophic position of organisms in biota, particles, coral skeletons, and sediments. But, this requires a clear understanding of the N isotope patterns of amino acids produced by phytoplankton. This project will examine whether different phytoplankton species produce amino acids with distinct N isotope patterns when using the same N source. The project will also study whether the N isotope patterns produced by the same species of phytoplankton change under different growth and environmental conditions. Information from this study will improve the ability to use N isotope values in amino acids in ecological and biogeochemical studies. This collaborative project combines novel research with broader impacts focused on engaging the public and promoting diversity and inclusion at various levels. Three graduate students and one postdoc will participate in the research. Research opportunities will be provided to undergraduate students, especially those with backgrounds. Students will be recruited through the McNair and Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation program at Texas A&M Univ. at Corpus Christi, a Hispanic Serving and Minority Serving Institution. To share results broadly, the investigators and students will give talks about marine science to local K-12 students in Corpus Christi TX. The New Bedford High School (in MA) summer marine intern program will be engaged in this project. Public lectures will be given on the topic of algal blooms and a children?s article will be written on the topic of isotopes. Outcomes of this project will also be incorporated into presentations to the Chesapeake Bay Program, Maryland Harmful Algal Bloom Task Force, and the Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee of the Maryland Coastal Bays. <br/> <br/>The use of N isotope values of different amino acids (?15N-AA) to retrieve the N source isotope signature of food webs and estimate trophic positions depends on information about the ?15N-AA produced by phytoplankton at the base of the food web which is still poorly understood. This study seeks to explore fundamental scientific questions to better understand ?15N-AA produced by phytoplankton. 1) Under the same nitrogenous nutrient and growth conditions, do ?15N-AA patterns vary between major phytoplankton groups? Are the unique ?15N-AA patterns in diatoms related to unique aspects of their N metabolism? 2) Do changes in phytoplankton physiology resulting from nitrogenous nutrient availability, N form utilized (ammonium, nitrate, and mixed), and/or other growth conditions independently produce significant changes in ?15N-AA? Phytoplankton samples will be collected from controlled culture (e.g., chemostat) experiments and from field studies in the Gulf of Mexico and Chesapeake Bay, especially during near-monospecific bloom events. By taking the advantage of newly developed analytical approaches, new knowledge of compound and intramolecular ?15N of poly-N AA such as arginine, asparagine, glutamine, and histidine in phytoplankton will be generated for the first time. This ground-truthing work will advance the understanding of ?15N-AA pattern produced by key phytoplankton species critical to the biological pump and harmful algal blooms under environmentally relevant physiological conditions. The expected outcomes from this work will enable new applications and more sophisticated trophic position analyses, studies of the efficiency of the ocean?s biological pump, and paleo-oceanographic reconstructions using amino acids preserved in natural archives.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The United States produces 10 million metric tons of hydrogen per year - 95% of it via steam methane reforming (SMR).  SMR emits 100 million tons of CO2 in the process. This represents a >$10 billion market in the US alone and an important opportunity to reduce CO2 emissions. Methane pyrolysis promises green hydrogen with >5 times less energy than water electrolysis at costs competitive with steam methane reforming by producing solid carbon instead of gaseous carbon dioxide. The solid carbon, if produced correctly, can be used in tires, batteries, and concrete. The research in this project could increase the value of the solid carbon by-product produced alongside clean hydrogen in methane pyrolysis. If successful, this technology could lead to expanded domestic production capabilities with net-zero emissions from sectors such as fertilizer, transportation (batteries, fuel cells, synthetic fuels, and tires), and heavy industry (steel and cement).<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to develop a novel method to tune the production of high-quality solid carbon using methane pyrolysis. Carbon black forms in pyrolysis reactors both homogeneously in the gas phase and heterogeneously on catalysts, reactor walls, and on seed particles entrained in the gas. By tuning temperature, residence time, flow profile, and seed materials, this project will result in an improved understanding of carbon precipitation and formation in methane pyrolysis reactors. This improved understanding and the development of a reactor thermochemical model will ultimately lead to better control of a process to produce high quality solid carbon that can be used in tires, batteries, and concrete.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nevertheless, our current lack of understanding of when, how, and why RL works necessitates the need for new synthesis and analysis tools for safety-critical CPS driven by RL controllers; this is the main scope of this project. The primary focus of this research is on mobile robot systems. Such CPS are often driven by RL controllers due to their inherent complex - and possibly uncertain/unknown - dynamics, unknown exogenous disturbances, or the need for real-time decision making. Typically, RL-based control design methods are data inefficient, they cannot be safely transferred to new mission & safety requirements or new environments, while they often lack performance guarantees. This research aims to address these limitations resulting in a novel paradigm in safe autonomy for CPS with RL controllers. Wide availability of the developed autonomy methods can enable safety-critical applications for CPS with significant societal impact on, e.g., environmental monitoring, infrastructure inspection, autonomous driving, and healthcare. The broader impacts of this research include its educational agenda involving K-12, undergraduate and graduate level education.<br/><br/>To achieve the research goal of safe, efficient, and transferable RL, three tightly coupled research thrusts are pursued: (i) accelerated & safe reinforcement learning for temporal logic control objectives; (ii) safe transfer learning for temporal logic control objectives; (iii) compositional verification of temporal logic properties for CPS with NN controllers. The technical approach in these thrusts relies on tools drawn from formal methods, machine learning, and control theory and requires overcoming intellectual challenges related to integration of computation, control, and sensing.

This project?s high yield lactic-to-acrylic technology will help grow the corn utilization industry and provide high paying jobs across rural America as well as economic competitiveness in global markets. Every plant constructed to convert lactic acid fermented from sugar into drop-in, low-carbon, renewable acrylic acid is estimated to bring $12 million in economic activity to a county with significant bio-based sugar crops (e.g., corn, beets, cane). Approximately 250 plants are needed at this scale to convert today?s petrochemical acrylic acid to a bio-based source.<br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to utilize high alcohol content feedstocks using catalyst innovation comprising engineered amine treatment of cation-exchanged zeolites. The catalyst has been shown to outperform numerous previously-utilized catalysts with >90% yields of acrylic products during catalyzed dehydration of lactic acid. So far, those in the field have investigated feeds containing aqueous solutions of methyl lactate or lactic acid in concentrations from 10-40%. Methanol has not been used as a co-feed in concentrations greater than 5%, therefore this project will investigate higher concentrations of alcohols (5%-80%, using methanol or ethanol).  The project will use both methanol and ethanol as the alcohol size is likely to alter active site reactivity and/or shift the equilibrium of esterified versus acidic acrylate products. These experiments address two areas of concern in the commercialization of the technology and determine the relative dehydration rates of ethanol and lactic acid under competitive adsorption conditions to provide foundational information required for reactor scaling.

Fractals are geometric objects which are highly irregular, exhibiting detail at arbitrarily small scales.  Such sets arise naturally in mathematics, and have applications to a diverse array of problems in science and engineering.  Harmonic analysis emerged in the late 20th century as a tool for the study of the geometry of fractal sets, and in return fractal geometry has motivated many interesting questions in harmonic analysis. This event brings together researchers to find new synergies between existing methods and to formulate new approaches to build on recent progress at the intersection of these fields.<br/><br/>The focus of the conference is on geometric properties of fractal sets using tools from harmonic analysis. A classical problem in this area is the Falconer distance problem, which asks how large the Hausdorff dimension of a compact set must be to ensure that it determines a positive Lebesgue measure set of pairwise distances.  More generally, one may inquire when high dimensional sets determine more complicated patterns, leading to a host of fascinating questions about finite point configurations.  These problems can be studied via bounds for convolution operators, bringing to bear tools from harmonic analysis. Another classical example is the Kakeya problem, which asks when sets containing a line segment in every direction must have full Hausdorff dimension.

Magnetospheres form when a flowing plasma, like the solar wind, impacts a magnetic obstacle, like a planet, and are an integral part of space weather systems.  Earth?s magnetosphere has been observed by spacecraft for decades, but magnetospheres can also exist on much smaller scales, such as around comets or asteroids that are difficult to study directly.  This project will create and explore artificial versions of these ?mini? magnetospheres in a laboratory environment.  By leveraging the ability of the experiments to be carried out with high repeatability, this study will provide an unprecedented, high-resolution three-dimensional map of a dynamic magnetosphere.  The results will advance our fundamental understanding of magnetospheres at the smallest scales and, in turn, improve our ability to model planetary, including Earth's, magnetospheres.  This project will also provide advanced training and mentorship to graduate students to prepare them for the U.S. STEM workforce.<br/><br/>Mini-magnetospheres provide a unique environment to study kinetic-scale plasma physics that have traditionally been modeled with numerical simulations.  This project will create ion-scale magnetospheres by coupling a supersonic, laser-driven plasma flow with a dipole magnet embedded in the uniform, magnetized plasma of the Large Plasma Device (LAPD) at the University of California, Los Angeles.  High-repetition experiments will produce highly-resolved, volumetric datasets in order to 1) examine the evolution of global magnetospheric structure for a range of dipole magnet and plasma parameters, 2) study the dependence of magnetospheric structure and magnetic reconnection dynamics on the orientation of the dipole field, 3) observe the formation of bow shocks, and 4) compare to 3D particle-in-cell simulations.  The results will help validate numerical simulations and magnetospheric models, as well as complement spacecraft observations of mini-magnetospheres such as those associated with comets and lunar magnetic anomalies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Delays in the acquisition of certain aspects of language are thought to reveal something about how children learn language, and something about the nature of human language itself. This project shows that, contrary to previous literature assuming delayed learning of LDB in the language of interest, children are in fact not delayed with respect to LDB, and the reason previous studies found evidence for a delay is that children's understanding of the verbs that were used (such as 'think', 'believe', etc.) differs from that of adults. This difference in understanding leads to the illusion that the learning of LDB is delayed. This project uses experimental judgment tasks to investigate children's understanding of LDB while controlling for the problematic verbs, shedding light on children's language learning process. The project also includes an undergraduate researcher, contributing to the training of the next generation of language scientists.<br/><br/>LDB is investigated in a target language where a reflexive word meaning 'self' can refer to nouns that occur earlier in the sentence. The experiment tests whether children can understand that in a sentence equivalent to English 'John thinks that Mary brushed [self]', 'self' can refer to Mary (the local antecedent) but also John (the long distance antecedent). Children have been found to strongly prefer the local antecedent, while adults allow both antecedents. The experiment finds that in order for the long distance antecedent to be licensed it must be logophoric, which means it is the source of belief or reported information. In a sentence like 'John thinks that Mary brushed [self]', 'John' is considered logophoric, and thus is an eligible antecedent to 'self'. However, children fail to assign the first noun as logophoric because of their difficulty in acquiring the correct properties of the verb 'think'. This experiment replicates previous findings that children struggle with LDB in such sentences. It then includes a manipulation that highlights the logophoric meaning of 'think', thereby forcing children to consider the first noun phrase as logophoric. Pilot studies find that in the first experiment (no logophoric manipulation), children fail to allow the LDB interpretation, while in the second experiment (highlighting logophoricity), children do allow the LDB interpretation. This therefore shows that the locus of difficulty is not the computational complexity involved in LDB, but rather is related to children?s acquisition of verb like 'think' and similar verbs denoting mental states.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nationally, mathematics and science teaching positions are hard to staff particularly in high-need schools. Through the education pathway envisioned by this project, participants will begin at a two-year or a four-year college, transfer to a math or science education/teacher licensure program at a four-year college, co-enroll in a master?s degree program, gain teacher licensure, and return to high-need schools as math or science teachers. The project will enhance math and science education coursework and experiences for undergraduates and graduate students by integrating mentored student teaching experiences; developing innovative course curricula using design thinking; creating modules showing design thinking in action that scholars and education professionals may access to enhance their science and math curriculum; and facilitating professional development opportunities to develop participants? professional identities as teachers prepared to succeed in high-need schools.<br/><br/>The proposed project will support 15 undergraduate students along a five-year education pathway through a STEM degree (chemistry, biology, mathematics) and a Master of Science in Teaching (MST) as part of their preparation for a New York State adolescent-education teaching certification for grades 7?12. The goal is to prepare the scholarship recipients to teach in high-need local educational agency classrooms near Iona University, such as Ossining Union Free School District and Mount Vernon City School District. This project builds from a successful Noyce Capacity Building project, through which Iona and Westchester Community College (WCC) built a 2+2+1 articulation agreement for students to earn an associate degree at WCC in addition to a STEM degree and an MST at Iona. This project will make use of a place-based interdisciplinary module designed to expose students in entry-level chemistry courses to the idea of using urban ecology as an interdisciplinary subject with connections to math, chemistry, and biology. The project will also employ design thinking within the urban ecology modules. Design thinking is an innovative concept regularly used by Fortune 500 companies as a creative problem-solving process to contemplate and discover innovative solutions to problems of all kinds. The proposed project is designed to accomplish the following objectives. (1) Recruit a minimum of 15 Iona STEM majors or WCC transfer students who will have the coursework needed for NYS teaching certification through participation in the Noyce Scholars program. (2) Retain at least 93% of original Scholars through strategies that include experiential learning opportunities, academic enrichment, and mentoring. (3) Prepare program participants to teach in high-need LEAs. (4) Graduate and place 100% of Noyce Scholars in high-need LEAs. (5) Track and support the persistence of Noyce Scholar alumni during their high-need LEA teaching service and beyond by providing mentorship and induction support activities. The Iona Noyce program will contribute knowledge to the field of teacher preparation by exploring the use of interdisciplinary STEM modules as a tool for Scholars to experience place-based STEM teaching first as students and then later as teachers. Additionally, Scholars will engage in experiences that include summer research, fieldwork, and a Design Thinking and Innovation workshop introducing the main principles of design thinking and the use of design thinking for developing curricula and motivating educational change. This combination of curriculum, activities, and support is built on best practices and is intended to develop Scholars? identities as teachers, giving them a sense of their abilities as professionals, researchers, innovators, and mentors who can tackle challenges in the classroom. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Chromatin factors regulate developmental processes by controlling the chromatin state of specific loci to coordinate expression of multiple developmental genes.  Much remains to be learned about how chromatin is programmed and how active or inactive domains are maintained during development.  Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase 1 (PARP1) and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolase (PARG) (PAR enzymes) play a vital role during organismal development by controlling chromatin state and transcription.  In this project, researchers will use the PAR pathway as a model to understand how cells undergo quick, localized and reversible chromatin reprogramming to fine tune gene activity.  The findings will enhance our knowledge of developmental gene regulation and facilitate new methodology for reprogramming genes, for example through activation of PAR enzymes present in repressed chromatin loci.  This project will reinforce the research environment at University of North Dakota by providing local high school and undergraduate students of different backgrounds with new opportunities to learn fundamental and biomedical aspects of developmental processes.<br/><br/>This project will focus on the study of molecular mechanisms of PARG enzyme regulation, using Drosophila as a model.  The research will be driven by the hypothesis that regulation of PARG activity is crucial for tissue-specific and cell cycle-specific differences in poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation rates.  The preliminary data show that PARG, which does not have a DNA-binding motif, has two distinct roles in chromatin: 1) PARP1-independent binding to gene body of silent genes, likely to repress their expression; 2) binding of PARP1-occupied active loci, likely to maintain their expression in cooperation with PARP1.  This project will focus on characterizing the molecular mechanism targeting and regulating PAR enzymes in living cells in steady-state conditions and in mutant backgrounds.  The experiments will probe 1) what mechanisms recruit PAR enzymes to specific loci and 2) what triggers and fine-tunes PAR-dependent processes, including underlying mechanisms.  The outcomes will advance understanding of the PAR pathway and how it might be modulated in new ways.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Genetic Mechanisms program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division of the Directorate for Biological Sciences and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Change efforts in higher education are challenging, in part because faculty have not received training in organizational change, and in part because effective change needs involvement from diverse stakeholders beyond the professoriate. As a consequence, institutions may continue to use policies and practices that do not effectively address gaps in participation, such as for students of color, women, and people with disabilities. Previous research on organizational change in higher education highlights the importance of social relationships for equipping faculty and other stakeholders to make significant changes to their beliefs and practices. In that vein this project will create a cross-institutional Community of Transformation (CoT) to support university change agents who are working to make changes focused on justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) in their own departments and institutions. This approach is a particularly good match for JEDI-centered organizational change, which requires not only individual adoption of new practices, but also transformation of institutional structures and practices. Through an innovative approach to community building and storycrafting, the project intends to help CoT members make significant JEDI-centered institutional change efforts, learn from one another?s experiences, and learn effective change strategies towards a more just future. This work aims to advance understanding of how CoTs can help JEDI-oriented institutional change efforts thrive.<br/><br/>This project plans to convene a cross-institutional CoT of JEDI change agents in engineering. Through both virtual and in-person events, participants will increase their resilience and skills in enacting change at their institutions, build community and co-support for each other as change agents, and increase their individual and collective agency to create organizational change. This project hopes to provide key insights into improving faculty?s change agency by integrating professional development into the CoT, fostering relationships through which members will learn from each other, and evaluating how a cross-institutional CoT can improve change agents? capacity to improve their own departmental and institutional systems to broaden participation in STEM and advance JEDI outcomes. These key insights will be developed through research on the CoT participants and their efforts to promote change. The research team will use narrative and discourse methods to analyze CoT activities and surveys, interviews, and focus groups with CoT members.

While there are legitimate concerns about how the use of these tools could be detrimental to learning, this research project aims to leverage language models to better prepare engineering learners of the 21st Century. The research project will use modern AI and machine learning (ML) tools to automate analysis of student-written responses to challenging concept questions. These qualitative questions are often used in large STEM classes to support active learning pedagogies; they require minimum calculations and focus on the application of underlying physical and chemical phenomena to various situations. With previous NSF funding, we have developed the Concept Warehouse (NSF DUE 1023099, 1821439, 2135190), a classroom response system where students provide written justifications to concept questions. Providing written justifications targets development of reasoning and sense-making skills in students and can also better prepare them for discussions with peers resulting in broader effectiveness of active learning pedagogies. However, expository prose also presents a daunting amount of information for instructors to process. In this project, we will leverage recent advancements in machine learning tools and natural language processing technologies to develop automated processes to analyze student-written justifications to challenging concept questions.<br/><br/>This project will join engineering education researchers at Tufts University and AI/ML researchers at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. We will focus on the following research questions: (1) Based on human coding, what ideas do students use in explaining challenging concept questions in statics? How do these vary among challenging concept questions studied? (2) How well can Transformer-based ML models replicate the coding done by the human coders? For isomorphic question pairs, how well do ML models trained on the first question?s explanations perform on the second question? More generally, can ML-based coding based on one question be applied successfully to code the data for other questions, and what are the limits to this generalizability? We will complete three research tasks: (1) data collection of written responses for the same concept questions from nine or more engineering statics instructors at different institutions; (2) manual coding of a subset of students? written explanations, and (3) developing and evaluating ML coding methods, followed by ML coding of the complete set of collected written explanations. While the project focuses on engineering statics, it is expected that findings will transfer to challenging questions in other engineering and science topics. Ultimately, successful implementation of machine learning will support learning and instruction of challenging concepts. Expected outcomes include a developing understanding of advantages and disadvantages of different ML approaches including their accuracy, determination of minimum data size requirements to apply the algorithms, and the ability to transfer learning from one question to isomorphic questions that require similar reasoning patterns. For instructors, data generated can provide real-time information about the different ways students are reasoning with examples of common cases. For engineering education researchers, characterizing explanations in different settings will support investigations of how student thinking relates to instructional practices and environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The experimental plans include the use of growth chambers under controlled conditions combined with field data to study the uptake of HONO onto leaves from a range of tree species that dominate major forested regions across North America. Since HONO is not well represented in chemical transport models, improvements in understanding HONO sources and sinks are expected to have important implications for improving air quality models and for determining the lifetime of some greenhouse gases, such as methane, in the atmosphere.<br/><br/>This effort combines expertise in atmospheric chemistry, microbial ecology, and modeling with unique analytical capabilities for measuring HONO soil emissions. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that variations in below-canopy hydrogen oxide radical (HOx) cycling and ozone levels in forested regions are driven by the variability of soil emissions of HONO (SHONO) and nitrogen oxide (NO) (SNO), that depend on season, edaphic properties, aboveground vegetation surfaces, and belowground nitrogen cycling that is mediated by microbe-plant interactions. Preliminary data show that high SNO has a significant impact on below canopy HOx in a forested environment, that NOy (the sum of reactive nitrogen oxides) fluxes are linked to forest composition, and that spatial variability in NOy fluxes can be mapped across the continental U.S. using forest inventory plots.

Nonetheless, few studies address how the plant host-rhizobiome interaction influences ecosystem sustainability and resistance to environmental change. Understanding these relationships is pivotal for anticipating ecosystem responses to environmental change. The PI?s goal for this proposal is to link plant host genetic diversity to rhizosphere microbial composition and its functional gene expression, and determine how the rhizobiome differentially affects plant host function and resistance to drought stress. The PI will use field surveys, greenhouse and manipulative experiments, coupled with new sequencing technology, and use a 10-year multi-site reciprocal Big Bluestem Garden. The PI will work with students and citizen scientists to determine the mechanistic interaction between plant host ecotype and rhizobiome in affecting fitness and drought resistance. Outcomes from this project will include significant advancement in knowledge of the interactive biotic factors between plant host and associated microbiota, and the resultant microbial mediated soil processes. This project will advance the knowledge base to help manage ecosystems substantially under the pressure of global climate change, and to provide students and managers with the fundamental concepts and context to do so. The project will Integrate education with research and extend the impact of this research to the current and future citizens and decision-makers. <br/>  <br/>The PI will focus on how plant host genotype affects the associated rhizobiome, which in turn has functional consequences on soil process and the ecosystem. The PI will work with students and citizen scientists to 1) quantify the relationship between the plant ecotype, associated rhizobiome, and microbially-mediated soil processes; 2) determine the mechanistic interaction between plant host ecotype and rhizobiome in affecting fitness and drought resistance; and 3) determine if the observed plant genetic diversity in plant populations in natural prairies across the Great Plains feeds back to affect rhizobiome composition and soil processes. Understanding the role of ecotypic variation within a foundation plant species on the composition and function of the rhizobiome is critical because dominant plant species exert a strong influence on communities and ecosystem processes. The PI will use Big Bluestem as a model system, and coupled multiple host and microbial omics approaches with a 10-year old reciprocal garden to understand the biotic interactions and ecotypic-based mechanisms that regulate ecosystem processes. The PI will also employ broad field surveys and greenhouse experiments to gain insights into the plant host-rhizobiome interaction. In this project, the PI will integrate ecological genomics, microbiome function, ecosystem processes, and structural modeling, to deepen the understanding of plant host ecotypic influences on microbial processes, and the modulation of rhizobiome in plant host resilience to drought stress. Therefore, this CAREER award will ultimately provide a deeper mechanistic understanding of plant-microbiota interaction; larger-scale spatial, temporal knowledge gain; and dissemination of knowledge to a broad audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How does magma build up beneath active volcanoes, and how long does it take to do so? What controls whether it erupts or cools deep underground to form plutons? How long does it stay molten there, and how much of it is eruptible for how long? Hundreds of millions of people live within 100 miles of active volcanoes. They are at risk of being exposed to volcanic hazards. Volcanic eruptions also affect climate and the environment. Yet decades of research have not answered some of these basic questions. This project will address these questions in the Tuolumne pluton. It is home to the spectacular rock exposures of Yosemite National Park. Uranium-lead age dates of small minerals will determine when the plutons cooled to the rocks that are exposed at the surface today. They will also reveal the duration of time that magma was present. Additionally these much smaller minerals are found included in several-inch-large potassium feldspar crystals. The chemistry of the feldspars serves like fingerprints in a crime scene. They will determine when, where and how much magma was stored 90 million years ago to feed volcanic eruptions. How sticky and hot magma was will help determine what these eruptions might have looked like. This project supports two research groups: 1) Researcher Memeti, a woman at Hispanic-serving, undergraduate-focused California State University Fullerton, and 2) Researcher Schoene at research-focused Princeton University. The team will train several graduate students in age dating and chemistry methods. Graduate students help train undergraduate students involved in different parts of the project. All students take part in all aspects of research activities including field work and publishing. Memeti will complete following activities: 1) update authored Yosemite audiotour mobile app based on this project?s results, 2) continue to organize field trips to Yosemite National Park, and 3) share research results with park rangers. 4) She will develop introductory geology labs for geology students, and 5) continue her outreach efforts on volcanic hazards at southern California public events. Schoene will teach local K-12 teachers on volcanoes and hazards in a seminar at Princeton University. <br/><br/><br/>This 3-yr collaborative RUI project between California State University Fullerton and Princeton University seeks to determine the time and length scales of magma bodies in magmatic arcs and their changes in composition, crystallinity, and volume over time. The study will use K-feldspar pheno- and megacrysts up to 12 cm long and megacryst-hosted mineral inclusions from the Half Dome and Cathedral Peak units of the 95-85.5 Ma Tuolumne intrusive complex in the central Sierra Nevada. K-feldspar textures and zoning will be imaged in 3D with CT scans and CL images and quantitatively analyzed with electron microprobe and laser ablation ICPMS for geochemistry. K-feldspar mineral inclusions will be measured for TIMS-TEA U-Pb zircon and titanite geochronology, SIMS Ti-in-zircon and Zr-in-titanite thermometry, and EMP and LA-ICPMS plagioclase and hornblende thermometry and chemometry (determining melt compositions). These data will be synthesized to test the hypotheses that the Tuolumne intrusive complex matured thermally during incremental construction, creating interconnected magma bodies many kilometers in length, capable of magma flow, fractionation, mixing, and likely eruption. These data will reflect on current debates about whether long-lived and large composite intrusions like the Tuolumne complex are characterized by ?hot? or ?cold? storage. ?Cold? storage is characterized by small, rigid magma mushes that spend most of their time at temperatures near or at the solidus, limiting interaction with coeval magma bodies, only occasionally, if ever, ?defrosting? by magma recharge to feed volcanic eruptions. In contrast, ?hot storage? allows for dynamic inter-unit magma mixing and crystal recycling in large (10-100s of square kilometers) magma bodies at significantly higher temperatures above the solidus and lower crystallinities and at time scales of up to millions of years.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will partner with seven independent school districts in the Sam Houston State University (SHSU) general geographic area with a primary partner being the Huntsville Independent School District. Additional partners include other school districts in the surrounding area and two community colleges from the Lone Star College (LSC) system, namely LSC-Montgomery and LSC-Tomball. An underlying aim of the project is to strengthen pathways from community colleges to a four-year STEM degree and teaching licensure while, at the same time, increasing the number of certified male teachers who reflect the demographics of the African American and Hispanic students served in high-need school districts in Texas in the vicinity of SHSU. This project will provide scholarships along with academic and co-curricular support to thirty-nine (39) STEM students who are majoring in SHSU's College of Science and Engineering Technology with majors in computer science, chemistry, engineering technology, geology, mathematics, physics, or astronomy. Important consideration will also be given to students in the LSC system who are transferring to one of these majors at SHSU. The project will be guided by a Culturally Responsive-Sustaining (CR-S) theoretical framework. Using the CR-S framework, prospective teachers will learn strategies to create student-centered learning environments, prepare students for rigorous and independent learning, elevate marginalized voices, and empower students to work as agents of social change in STEM.<br/><br/>Several goals guide the execution of this project. The first goal is to recruit and prepare thirty-nine (39) pre-service teachers to become certified secondary STEM teachers. These Noyce Scholars will earn a double major with the additional major in education complementing a STEM major. In turn, the project will address critical teacher shortages in high-need schools in the SHSU geographic area. For a second goal, over the 5-year duration of the project, a project intent is that at least 40% percent of the Noyce Scholars will be African American and/or Hispanic males and at least 35% will be transfer students that emanate from community college partners. As a corollary to this goal, the project will utilize a national ""Call Me Mister"" model while partnering with SHSU's Establishing Leadership In & Through Education (ELITE) program - a Minority Male Program for Black and Hispanic Males for whom special academic support and peer mentoring are provided. Third, the project will provide financial, academic, and co-curricular support to assure that the new teachers are well-prepared to teach and meet students' needs in high-need schools in suburban and rural Texas. In the process, the project will incorporate SHSU's extensive residency model for teacher preparation. This model provides important opportunities for field-based learning and experiences. Likewise, teacher preparation and induction will emphasize strong pedagogical and STEM discipline content knowledge and will incorporate a culturally responsive curriculum along with a diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) curriculum and activities. This approach will enable high-need schools in rural and suburban Texas and other areas nationwide to provide their K-12 students with a solid and inclusive STEM education, thereby helping to prepare many of these students for STEM careers. A fourth goal is to develop an understanding of the effectiveness of project components with respect to project goals as well as to provided formative and summative feedback through education research and mixed methods project evaluation. In concert with this, project outcomes and lessons learned will be disseminated through several panel presentations at local venues, regional and national conferences, and project networks. This Track 1: Scholarships and Stipends project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project aims to quantify and understand the wake interactions between two roughness elements in close proximity under incoming turbulent flow. For this purpose, flow measurements will be made for a wide range of configurations using state-of-the-art instrumentation. The project will be performed at an undergraduate institution providing foundation for engineering research and enhancing undergraduate research training. The project will provide engaging research experiences for undergraduate students who will gain valuable research training and mentoring while working alongside faculty.<br/><br/>High-speed volumetric particle image velocimetry, a non-intrusive laser-diagnostic flow measurement technique, will be used to measure the flow over two cylindrical roughness elements positioned in close proximity and immersed in a turbulent boundary layer. The cylinders will be positioned at various configurations to vary the degree by which the upstream cylinder shelters the downstream cylinder from the incoming high-momentum flow. The experiments will allow for the characterization of rich flow physics: the interaction of two 3D shear layers in the lower portion of a turbulent boundary layer. The objectives are to 1) quantify the flow interactions between the wakes of the two cylindrical roughness elements; 2) characterize the vortical structures shed from isolated cylindrical roughness elements and identify the modifications to these structures due to the introduction of an upstream cylinder; 3) investigate the effects of additional upstream elements (i.e., sheltering by 2, 3, and 4 upstream elements) on the captured flow physics, 4) quantify the roughness-induced perturbation to the boundary layer and its coherent structures; and 5) distill a spatiotemporally-resolved flow description that illustrates sheltering flow physics across a wide range of arrangements. The spatially- and temporally-resolved measurements will aid in addressing a gap in the literature on the flow over two roughness elements in close proximity, offer insight into the rich flow physics involved, and provide benchmark results to aid other researchers in their modeling and validation efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some wildlife species migrate thousands of miles each year and thus face environmental changes in many different parts of their life cycle.  These species may thus be especially susceptible to environmental change.  To address these important conservation questions, the proposed research will follow individual long-distance migratory birds, in particular Hudsonian Godwits (Limosa haemastica), throughout their entire lives, from their breeding grounds in Alaska to their nonbreeding grounds in southern Chile using novel miniaturized tracking devices and on-the-ground efforts by an international team of collaborators. Following individual birds throughout their lives will provide insights into how changes occurring during different time periods or in different locations may act separately or synergistically to influence the ability of entire populations to successfully survive and reproduce. Then, to aid the conservation of migratory species such as Hudsonian Godwits and deepen engagement with local communities, this project will focus on developing K12 curricula in collaboration with local schools in rural Alaska and established educational media producers, facilitating international collaborations by holding online scientific symposia, and revising existing conservation plans to incorporate recent findings. <br/><br/>Global environmental changes driven my human activities are diverse and ubiquitous. Wildlife species migrate thousands of miles each year thus face environmental changes in many different parts of their life cycle.  These species populations may thus be especially vulnerable to environmental change. This study will utilize a study site that has been maintained since 2009 in Beluga River, Alaska, to address the simultaneous effects of biotic and abiotic pressures acting throughout the life cycle of the long-lived, long-distance migratory bird, the Hudsonian Godwit (Limosa haemastica). Godwits face multiple separate, and potentially synergistic, environmental changes throughout the year as they migrate from southern Chile to Alaska. In this study, individual-level information on the ability of godwits to alter their migration timing over the course of their lives will be coupled with population-level information about how godwit chicks may be forced to trade off foraging and safety to help inform a species-level assessment of how well godwits will be able to respond to future environmental changes occurring throughout their annual cycle. As a consequence, this project?s results have the potential to illuminate not only long-held questions in migration ecology, but fundamental questions about how individuals, populations, and species are able to respond to environmental change. Ultimately, the project?s aim is to provide critical, broadly applicable information to inform assessments of species? vulnerability to future global change.

Energy storage is a critical technology for the energy utility industries offering more reliable and affordable energy supply, a cleaner environment, and stronger energy infrastructure. Specific advantages of energy storage include a robust energy supply during storms and other natural disasters, aiding response and recovery efforts. This technology may also keep power plants and the grid functioning in times of physical and cyber-security threats. The project enables excellent grid stability and power plant flexibility to accommodate the growth of various renewable energy technologies and the expansion of electrified transportation systems.  <br/><br/>This STTR Phase 1 project proposes to address a technological innovation in energy storage. The reduced Levelized Electricity Cost due to this storage can directly benefit the end-users and broader population in the US and across the globe.  Notably, existing mechanical storage technologies have many attractive features such as short to mid-load response, black start, robust, long life, safety, and efficiency, but these technologies are not good at meeting scalability, reliability, and compactness metrics. On the other hand, chemical storage has mid-load response, long-lifetime, and scalability, but is inadequate with regard to safety, short-load response, black start, and efficiency. The proposed solution allows energy companies to explore low-cost technologies that can offer better performance and can be easily integrated with existing fossil power plants. The primary innovation combines mechanical and chemical storage technologies so that the resultant technology adapts the best features to provide enhanced performance at a cheaper capital, operational, and maintenance cost. The hybrid mechanical and chemical system proposed here uses supercritical carbon dioxide (sCO2) as the mechanical storage component, while chemical storage is achieved using natural gas or hydrogen.

Currently, the design and optimization of functional blocks and chips are implemented in different domains without self-consistent links between different models, and without co-design or co-optimization between them. This project, if successful, will translate to sustained innovations in the microelectronics industry at-large and permit the US to maintain global leadership in microelectronics, delivering systems that achieve more-than-Moore scaling for years to come. This teaming project will help meet the future workforce needs in microelectronics, utilizing the Nation?s First Semiconductor Degrees Program (SDP) just launched at Purdue University. The project will leverage partnerships with U of Central Florida, UC Santa Barbara, and UC San Diego, all minority-serving institutions to attract underrepresented students, and will also partner with Community Colleges to develop training programs.<br/><br/>The technical objective of this teaming effort is to break the barriers across applications, design domains, and abstraction levels, in modeling, simulation, optimization, and design through an open-source, multiscale, application-agnostic platform (Open-MAP) for heterogeneous SiP co-design. Open-MAP encompasses three key components: (1) A multiscale multiphysics modeling and analysis seamlessly integrated with either first-principles accuracy or a user-desired level of accuracy, which is further enriched by data, ML-assisted, and uncertainty quantification techniques; (2) A suite of multiphysics-informed design and optimization tools to automate co-design from intent to fabrication; (3) A series of co-design projects that will be conducted to identify critical barriers to co-design, for informing and guiding the development of Open-MAP, and eventually demonstrating the co-design advantages using the Open-MAP capabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The ability to read Braille is highly correlated with improved independence and quality of life. An estimated 70% of the blind are unemployed yet, of that subpopulation that is Braille literate, only 10% are unemployed. There is a Braille literacy crisis - only 8.5% of the blind population in the US can read Braille today, compared to 50% in the 1960s. There are several factors theorized to contribute to increasing Braille illiteracy including: 1) a shortage of teachers qualified to teach Braille, 2) negative outlooks on the difficulty and cost of Braille learning, and 3) and difficulties integrating blind students into mainstream schools that don?t have the specialized resources for this population. The results of this project will assist students of all ages in learning how to read Braille, including secondary Braille learners who become blind later in life. Aiming at inhibiting the Braille literacy crisis, the technology enables the blind to be given the same opportunities as their sighted peers, including better chances at graduating from high school and college, obtaining employment, and having high independence levels.<br/><br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project is in development of a wearable, computer vision-based, real-time Braille-to-speech learning device. While the primary mission of the project is to unlock the full potential of blind individuals through Braille literacy, the overall goal for the technology is to unlock the full potential of human touch with computer-assisted augmentation cues in response to intricate textural patterns. The proposed technology will detect such patterns in a contactless approach, preserving the integrity of the material, and provide auditory feedback in real-time to allow for mechanosensory-augmented feedback. This project focuses on establishing the technical feasibility of such an approach by: 1) determining if the device and interpreting algorithms can be made robust to environmental and user postural variations, 2) developing capabilities to perform well on textured and/or patterned surfaces, and 3) conducting usability testing to identify areas of the user experience that must be enhanced in the future to be viable in the market with two vital stakeholders - Braille tutors and Braille students. These goals, if completed successfully, will not only impact Braille learners but also open up other market applications for this technology such as manufacturing and medicine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The primary aim of this project is to evaluate various types of mass transport that occur from the interaction between mean shear stress (i.e. generated by velocity gradients in unidirectional flow) and instantaneous and localized shear stress generated by chaotic turbulence in the presence of density stratification. Findings from this work will improve understanding of deep ocean mixing, brine discharges in bays or subglacial lakes, saltwater intrusions in rivers, and avalanches, among others. The work will include mentorship of a graduate student and undergraduate researchers through the Graduates Linked with Undergraduates in Engineering program that supports women in STEM. The PI will develop large-scale public engagement events surrounding environmental mixing processes through art exhibits and educational modules. Further, the research team will partner with a local science museum to develop a permanent exhibit as well as a hands-on laboratory workshop for K-12 home-schooled students to study gravity currents; data generated from these experiments will be shared with the research community. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of this research is to comprehensively evaluate the independent and combined roles of energetic turbulent flows with and without current-generated shear acting upon density-stratified fluid systems. This will be achieved via a comprehensive laboratory approach using unique and highly controllable facilities that allow full quantification of links between flow energetics, buoyancy, and fluid properties with mixing and mass transport dynamics. Three distinct flow scenarios will be considered: turbulence with no mean current, a density current released into fluid with background turbulence, and advection of turbulence over a density interface. Non-invasive quantitative imaging techniques will be used to measure velocity and mass concentration fields to characterize flow dynamics. This systematic approach will provide an understanding of how competing sources of turbulence contribute to mixing and transport, particularly when shear-driven flows act in conjunction with background turbulence. Impacts are expected to be far-reaching, with direct and practical means for implementing the scientific knowledge gained through the laboratory and synthesis efforts. Additionally, significant outcomes are expected via the complementary educational and public outreach activities designed to home-schooled K-12 students, along with the general public. These activities will be assessed annually throughout the duration of the proposal period to foster continued improvement of equity, diversity, and inclusivity in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

What issues do reviewers focus on? Do authors rebut and/or implement some of these comments more than others? Peer review is a social process where reviewers and authors exchange competing arguments about the merits of new scientific work. In these exchanges, authors advance new arguments in their submissions, which are critically evaluated by peer reviewers who contest some of these arguments and affirm others. Authors then respond to these reviews with counter-arguments, sometimes conceding and other times refuting. This process of peer review - the exchange of argument, evaluation, and response ? is a social, institutional means of shaping what is published as scientific knowledge. This project will systematically depict this exchange process and its variation, revealing how different fields establish socially accepted knowledge claims. We intend to do this by: representing the hierarchical logical dependencies of scientific arguments; discerning distinct expressions of epistemological value; and developing a method that identifies where and when such evaluations are intertextually represented. When these patterns of exchange and evaluation are viewed in the aggregate, they will offer authors, reviewers, editors, and field participants a means by which to observe these hidden epistemological deliberations, to reflect on their merits, and to potentially help participants advocate for improvements in peer review. The techniques we develop should also enable social scientists to systematically study evaluative exchanges more generally, and this approach can be used to see how evaluative norms are practiced in different social and institutional contexts.<br/><br/>Using tens of thousands of evaluative exchanges and nearly 100,000 scholarly texts of OpenReview and JSTOR, we will systematically study evaluative exchanges among peer scholars over the course of three interrelated phases: how authors advance arguments, how peers evaluate and review them, and how authors counterargue and revise their manuscript in response to those reviews. We will apply natural language processing techniques including discourse parsing, rhetorical structural theory, and network analysis to investigate evaluative exchanges in both private peer reviews and public review-and-responses. The work has three aims: first, to discover the semantic structure of scientific arguments and how they vary within and across distinct scholarly fields. This entails understanding the kinds of claims, warrants, and evidence scientists use to debate; how these are interrelated in network forms or structures; and how certain forms in turn are specific to different scientific cultures. Second, we aim to discover the latent inter-textual structure of scientific arguments and, in particular, how responding scientists forge arguments that rearrange, omit, or even emphasize the semantic relations of other scientists? arguments as laid out in texts. This entails innovating ?text as data? methods in order to observe and measure discrete connections across disparate texts. Finally, we aim to understand the conditions under which scientists change their minds: how their arguments get revised and how resolution is achieved. This entails understanding whether and to what extent argument structures are updated or aligned by counter- or responding arguments. <br/><br/>The project is co-funded by the Science of Science: Discovery, Communications, and Impact and the Human Networks and Data Science Programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Presently, almost all commercial low-emissivity windows severely block mobile signals from entering buildings - a serious problem in today's world that demands fast and uninterrupted mobile connectivity. The proposed low-emissivity windows can be manufactured cost-competitively and significantly reduce the costs of installing indoor cellular aids such as routers and antennas. This technology will accelerate the further adoption of low-emissivity windows to reduce greenhouse gas emissions as well as support the further deployment of 5G technologies.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to investigate scalable manufacturing of mobile, signal transmissive, low-emissivity windows by using lithographic deposition of photoresist structures on the glass substrate prior to low-emissivity vacuum coating. The project proposes to deposit photoresist structures with non-conductive spacers on glass substrate, reducing the low-emissivity coating?s electric conductivity that prevents wireless signal passthrough. Dielectric layers will be deposited over the sidewalls to form protective layers over the low-emissivity coatings to protect against oxidative corrosion. The width of the photoresist structures will range between 2 to 5 micrometers to minimize the degradation of low-emissivity coatings to less than 2%, to maintain thermal performance. After low-emissivity coating deposition, the non-planar spacers will subsequently collapse into the photoresist layer restoring low-emissivity coatings to their original planar position thereby rendering the photoresist structure invisible to the eye. Furthermore, the team will explore additional photoresist designs to address potential lighting diffractions that may form on the finished window.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Experiments in a high-fidelity driving simulator examine the ways that automated vehicle control affects drivers? sustained attention.  Other behavioral experiments examine factors that reduce people's ability to remain attentive. The project trains graduate and undergraduate students in experimental psychology, cognitive modeling, and human factors engineering. Findings help develop techniques for improving human performance in sustained attention tasks, like providing opportunities for rest and recovery or reducing opportunities for distraction.<br/><br/>Monitoring and surveillance tasks are challenging, and operators? performance drops over the course of 1/2 hour or less.

Despite many years of research and the clear importance of this topic, the processes underlying the vigilance decrement remain the subject of debate. This project uses novel experimental and analytic methods to identify the nature and causes of vigilance failures. The central goal is to isolate the roles of response bias, internal processing noise, and attentional lapses on the vigilance decrement. To do this, the project analyzes psychometric functions, curves that display signal detection rates task as a function of signal intensity, and are described by parameters that directly correspond to bias, noise, and lapse rate. The project examines how the form of the vigilance decrement varies with task characteristics that are believed to influence sustained attention, including task difficulty, mental rest, stimulus information format, and dual-task load. Performance is examined in laboratory tasks and in a simulated driving task.

Sylvatic (better known as bubonic) plague was introduced to North America in 1900 and is now maintained in native mammals in the western U.S., periodically eliciting disease outbreaks. Although some species seem to have natural resistance, others?such as prairie dogs?are highly susceptible. Despite the detection of plague resistance in a small number of prairie dogs, the disease still decimates populations throughout their range. The continued susceptibility of prairie dogs suggests there is some constraint inhibiting the widespread evolution of resistance to plague. This project uses whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing of resistant and susceptible prairie dogs to determine the genomic basis of recently evolved plague resistance. Mutations associated with resistance in natural populations and experiments will then be mapped in nature to determine the spatial distribution of resistance alleles and predict the location of potential resistance hotspots. Museum specimens of prairie dogs will also be genotyped to determine the rate of evolution of plague resistance. Given the increasing rate of novel pathogens emerging around the globe, this research will have broad implications for understanding when and where adaptation in nave hosts is likely to persist. This project will use research to enhance education by building capacity in universities serving Native American and Hispanic students. Traveling genomics workshops will be delivered to students and faculty, and students will be mentored at their own institutions as they conduct independent research in the system.<br/><br/>Adaptation to pathogens should be heavily favored by selection: Once immunity evolves, it should sweep to fixation across a species? range. Paradoxically, a more commonly observed pattern is variable immunity. Because there are multiple explanations for incomplete resistance, the ecological and evolutionary conditions under which resistance to novel pathogens is maintained are still poorly understood. For instance, to what extent does the habitat matrix influence the maintenance of resistance through processes such as gene dilution? Does the de novo evolution of resistance independently across populations lead to epistatic interactions preventing widespread resistance? Resistance to sylvatic plague (caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis) has been observed in prairie dogs (genus Cynomys) in six western states, but resistance is still rare. This project integrates genomic and transcriptomic analysis of experimentally infected animals with rangewide spatiotemporal sampling to elucidate how, when and where resistance evolves, and what prevents this adaptive trait from sweeping to fixation. Previous experimental infections and a natural epizootic will be used to determine the genomic basis of resistance in two species. Alleles associated with resistance, along with neutral alleles serving as a null model, will be genotyped in latitudinal transects spanning populations with different plague introduction times, and in museum specimens from at least three distinct time ranges. These data will enable estimates of the rate of evolution of resistance alleles and inferences of the landscape spatial structure and genomic characteristics facilitating resistance. Understanding how adaptation persists across space and time can enable facilitated adaptation in imperiled systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, the radiation space environment can undergo a significant loss and its energy is directly deposited into the atmosphere. This proposal aims to assess the respective role of waves and field line scattering in the relativistic electron precipitation and to evaluate its effects on the Earth?s atmosphere. The PI is an early career female scientist who will be mentored by a female faculty and a senior female scientist. Graduate and undergraduate students will be supported.<br/><br/>This project focuses on relativistic electron precipitation (REP) and addresses the following science questions (SQ): SQ1. What are the properties of wave-driven REP compared to CSS-driven REP? SQ2. What is the relative contribution of wave-driven REP and CSS-driven REP to the total REP? SQ3. What are the effects of REP on the atmosphere (e.g., ozone depletion, conductivity change)? This builds on preliminary work showing that the observed precipitation profiles at low-Earth-orbit differ depending on the associated driver. REP events will be collected from a decade of observations, which we will use as inputs to the Whole Atmospheric Community Climate Model (WACCM) to estimate the resulting atmospheric effects. The work will quantify if, where, and under what geomagnetic conditions CSS is more efficient in causing electron precipitation than waves. This result will be useful to radiation belt models that currently do not typically consider CSS. Similarly, the team will obtain the distribution of REP and its contribution from waves. With such information, they will infer the magnetospheric regions where pitch-angle scattering from wave-particle interactions is more favorable for relativistic electrons. Finally, WACCM simulations will provide an estimate of the ozone depletion caused specifically by relativistic electrons in the latitude and longitude where they occur most often, contributing toward how the local REP contribution should be considered in large scale atmospheric models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The TWIMS is a conference series that takes place at a different institution in Texas each academic year. The ongoing goals of the TWIMS conference series are to highlight the research and professional accomplishments of outstanding, established female mathematicians, to provide a supportive platform for early career women mathematicians to showcase their research, to facilitate connections among Texas-based mathematicians that lead to long-lasting professional relationships, and to provide an inclusive environment to discuss issues facing those of gender minorities (ie. women, nonbinary, gender non-conforming, etc.) in mathematics. The conference is open to participants and presenters in any subfield of the mathematical sciences and will foster cross-disciplinary collaborations and mentorship opportunities among a diverse group of mathematicians of minority genders. In this way, TWIMS 2023 will contribute to the advancement of mathematical research and will encourage early career researchers to continue to work in the mathematical sciences. <br/><br/><br/>The inclusion of individuals from dissimilar backgrounds leads to the advancement of research. Increasing the number of people interested in pursuing math research and diversifying the backgrounds of researchers increases the number of perspectives from which any math problem is considered. This is key to the advancement of the field as a whole. At each career stage we see attrition of women in mathematics at rates disproportionately higher than those of men. In order to increase retention of women at every career stage, the institutional barriers preventing individuals from reaching their full potential need to be removed. Some of these barriers include the prevalence of negative societal gender stereotypes, lack of diverse representation and role models, and lack of encouragement from teachers and mentors. TWIMS aims to address these problems directly with the explicit goal of contributing to the retention of gender minorities in math at every career stage. To this end, the symposium will showcase the research of a diverse array of distinguished invited speakers to provide examples of successful women in math who can be role-models to younger mathematicians or women at an earlier stage in their careers. In addition TWIMS 2023 includes two professional development workshops aimed at improving the participation and presence of our participants in the mathematical community.

This doctoral dissertation project examines the evolution of skull and pelvis shape in a wide range of monkeys and apes to better understand how and when birthing difficulties may have arisen in different primate lineages, and better determine whether the difficulties faced by humans are unique to our species or a legacy shared by our taxonomic order. This project fosters graduate student training of a female scientist and can provide a deeper understanding of the difficulty of human childbirth for medical professionals. Results of this research are communicated to the public through popular science outlets.<br/><br/>Due to the tight fit between the birth canal and the infant skull, modern human childbirth is more dangerous and more likely to result in death for the infant or mother than in other large-bodied apes like chimpanzees and gorillas. As a result, difficult childbirth has historically been thought of as an evolved trait unique to humans, possibly stemming from the combination of pelvic adaptations to walking upright and the evolution of unusually large brains. However, smaller-bodied primates, such as the lesser apes and some monkeys, have been reported to experience serious complications, including maternal and infant death, during labor. This raises questions about whether humans experience difficult births for the same reason as smaller-bodied primates, or if difficult birth in humans is, in fact, unique. To address this question, this project investigates patterns of evolution and natural selection in the primate skull and pelvis, particularly in regions critical to childbirth, using 3D scan data to compare the patterns and magnitude of shape differences in the skull and pelvis to those expected based on genetic relationships among a wide sample of ape and monkey species.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These diseases stem from the natural age-associated deterioration of bodily function but it is unclear how deterioration across systems ? for example, bone loss and decreased immune system function ? are related. It also remains to be determined whether patterns of aging and age-associated disease in humans are further impacted by a mismatch between contemporary and ancestral environments. Key influences on individual differences in patterns of aging and timing of onset of age-related disease remain to be uncovered. This project studies wild-living non-human primates to examine the biological systems that deteriorate with age, and drills down into the mechanisms behind individual differences in the rate of aging. This study contributes valuable comparative data on aging that deepens an understanding of human aging patterns through identifying specific social and life course factors associated with age-related disease. This project supports the training and professional development of a postdoctoral researcher and multiple undergraduate students, local community outreach and engagement, and science outreach in K-12 schools in the U.S.<br/><br/>This project builds on over fifteen prior years of data collection on the same populations, which provides a rich context of behavioral and demographic data from over 100 individuals. Social adversity in early life and adulthood, cumulative reproductive effort, and multiple markers of biological aging are included predictors of aging patterns and outcomes. The main aims of the project are to identify: 1) the trajectory of aging across the life course with respect to physical deterioration (as measured by bone and muscle loss), physiological dysregulation (as indexed by hormone and immune markers), and molecular hallmarks of aging, and compare the results with existing datasets on aging from humans and other nonhuman primates; 2) the factors and timing that exert the strongest influence on inter-individual differences in the pace of biological aging, including social status, traumatic changes in social group membership, poor social integration, and increased reproductive effort. By coupling a rich longitudinal dataset with cutting edge methods in physiology, medical imaging, molecular techniques, and comparative methods, this study adds to a small, but growing number of nonhuman primate models of aging in wild populations that can build an informative context for understanding the evolution of, and variation in, human aging and aging-related deterioration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This occurs at mid-ocean spreading centers or at subduction zones where plates sink.  In some cases, though, volcanism occurs within a tectonic plate.  While some intraplate volcanism can be explained by upwelling of a mantle plume, most of Earth's intraplate volcanoes are probably not related to a plume despite such volcanoes being widespread.  One possible origin may involve transitions occurring between different types of plates.  This project investigates intraplate volcanism offshore of the California Borderlands.  This region has a complex plate margin history and unusual types of volcanism.  The research team will conduct and video-blog fieldwork on Guadalupe Island offshore Baja California.  This island is located along a system of failed mid-ocean spreading centers. It is an ideal location to test ideas related to the formation of non-plume, intraplate volcanism.  This project will support a postdoctoral scholar and a PhD student.  Together with Mexican collaborators, this project will provide educational opportunities, mentoring, and career development for USA and Mexican students. <br/><br/>This project investigates the development of seamounts along failed oceanic spreading centers as a symptom of their interaction with convergent margins. When oceanic spreading centers approach subduction zones, the subducting oceanic plate stalls and subdivides into smaller microplates while the convergent margin evolves into a transform margin bounded by migrating triple junctions. The microplates are eventually captured when their convergent margins become transform margins. This terminates decompression partial melting of depleted mantle along their former divergent margins and initiates the development of alkaline, low-degree partial melting of enriched mantle that produces seamounts along their fossil spreading-center margins. Mantle plumes can produce seamounts with similar chemistry and must also be considered as a potential origin for seamount trails such as the Fieberling?Guadalupe seamount chain that intersect fossil spreading centers. The project intends to determine the origin of oceanic Guadalupe Island, which is an alkaline seamount that emerged above sea level ~270 km offshore of Baja California (Mexico) and is situated along a system of failed oceanic rifts that developed offshore of the California borderlands during the late Cenozoic. The project will test four hypotheses that predict different temporal and geochemical patterns for the transition from tholeiitic, mid-ocean-ridge-basalt (MORB) magmatism to alkaline, fossil-spreading-center-seamount magmatism due to triple-junction instability or mantle-plume magmatism. The approach is to integrate field geology, 40Ar/39Ar geochronology, major?trace-element and isotope geochemistry, and petrological modelling. Investigation of seamount petrology and timing within a regional-tectonic framework may therefore reveal geodynamic relationships among mantle flow, mantle melting, triple-junction migration, microplate capture, and/or mantle-plume activity, in addition to improving our understanding of the evolution of western North America during the late Cenozoic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A ?blacksmithing tradition,? is a body of knowledge and skills that craftspeople practice throughout their lives that is passed down through apprenticeships from one generation to the next and creates technological patterns in the archaeological record. Uncovering the blacksmithing traditions that created iron tools can reveal how social relationships incentivized speed or care in iron production. Blacksmiths? patrons may have needed iron objects as quickly as possible to rapidly construct religious buildings, or patrons may have wanted iron objects carefully crafted to promote their quality and longevity for the sake of religious groups. Additionally, blacksmiths may have supplied religious groups with iron objects after the initial construction in an ad hoc manner to repair structures out of a sense of spiritual duty. Revealing relationships between blacksmiths, their patrons, and religious officials in the ancient past allows for comparison to modern blacksmiths who have been marginalized. In the research region female blacksmiths have been common practitioners, but large gender disparities in the labor market and STEM fields still exist. By revealing the unique material and social contributions of relevant earlier ironworkers, this project hopes to honor and inspire living blacksmiths, both male and female, and educate the general public about their craft.<br/><br/>Two questions guide this project. First, which was more important to the elites and the blacksmiths, the prestige of having the religious monument built quickly, or the piety of having the religious monument built well? Second, how can present day scientists use ancient iron objects to reveal blacksmithing traditions and the social relationships influencing those traditions? Iron objects are studied with optical and scanning electron microscopy, innovative image analysis, and chemical analysis of both residual metal and slag inclusions. Through these analyses, the researcher  quantifies the patterns in chemical and microstructural signatures of iron objects caused by blacksmithing tradition(s). These signatures show if speed or care was incentivized in the blacksmithing tradition(s). Moreover, blacksmithing tradition(s) are examined in the context of visually and algorithmically created typologies whose groups and sub-groups enable researchers to see if blacksmiths worked together in one localized large group, multiple separated large groups, or if they worked in smaller groups in an ad hoc manner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A common teaching challenge is how best to support students when they are stuck on a mathematics problem in a homework assignment. When the goal is to support productive struggle and not just provide the correct answer, it is not always clear how much support should be provided. An existing free web-based platform allows teachers and researchers to author questions and solution step supports, and it makes student action data available to instructors and researchers. Previous research results on the use of this platform to support student learning and the use of formative feedback in instruction in secondary school classrooms was promising. Given the potential of the platform as a useful pedagogical tool in those settings, this project aims to adapt the platform for use at the undergraduate level, where research indicates the need for such supports in introductory level mathematics and statistics courses. Understanding how the technological supports provided to college students as they complete mathematics problems impacts student learning and confidence will provide important insights for the design and implementation of educational materials broadly.<br/><br/>By adapting prior studies, this project seeks to determine whether the use of an existing online platform for formative assessment of student work at the college level leads to similar gains in mathematics learning and analogous changes in pedagogical practices as has been reported at the middle school and high school levels. Over 100 randomized control trials have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of supports provided through the ASSISTments platform, but these have primarily occurred at levels of schooling prior to the undergraduate years. This project aims to determine whether the use of the platform at the college level leads to similar gains in learning and analogous changes in pedagogical practices. This will be accomplished by replicating studies at the college level which have been shown in the literature to be ?Best So Far? supports ? those supports which have significantly impacted student learning the most. To accomplish this, the project has four main aims. First is to support scalability by adding a feature to the platform which allows for the uploading of questions and solutions from the learning management system Canvas, thus creating a database of at least 500 problems aligned with college algebra, precalculus, calculus, and statistics curricula. A second aim is to design questions and feedback to improve student understanding and help them complete math homework problems, by creating 16 classroom-ready assignments on common topics in college algebra. Third is to use the platform in college mathematics courses and measure its impact on student learning, and persistence in STEM majors, thus generating large and rich datasets containing student actions within the platform. The fourth and final project aim is to track system usage by instructors during the semester, i.e., while problems are assigned and immediately after the due date, and also the persistence of system usage from semester-to-semester. Project results will be disseminated through the Open Science Framework and the platform?s website. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research Partnerships (PFI-RP) project is reducing medical adhesive related skin injuries and device dislodgement events. Medical adhesives are used to secure wound care dressings and other critical devices to the skin. Although stronger adhesives can provide a higher level of securement, they are difficult to painlessly remove from the skin and may cause medical-adhesive-related skin injuries, which include skin tears and an increased risk of infection. This project will develop higher adhesion medical tapes, whereby the adhesion can be reduced for removal with the application of heat. This ability to remove easily will significantly reduce the risk of skin injury and subsequent infections while simultaneously providing the high adhesion required for secure attachment of medical devices during hospital care, reducing device dislodgement events and improving the quality of care. If successful, this solution will save over $1 billion annually in healthcare by preventing skin injury and critical device dislodgement. The project will train promising technical professionals in translational entrepreneurship with close mentorship from industry. <br/><br/>The proposed project will provide a chemical and physical understanding of temperature responsive adhesives required for high adhesion medical tape that can avoid both skin injury during tape removal and accidental device dislodgement. Current medical tapes do not have a temperature sensitive component to enable higher adhesion coupled with easier release. Initial prototypes have demonstrated an adhesive tape with a substantial temperature-responsive release attribute. Fully understanding the mechanism for this release could impact the development of stimuli-responsive adhesives that could be used for a wide range of medical and nonmedical applications. The major goals of this project are the following: (a) gain a fundamental knowledge of the release mechanism, (b) transfer to a high-volume manufacturing process to demonstrate scaling feasibility, (c) verify these high-volume manufacturing prototypes retain performance after storage with several pilot studies, (d) gain approval for testing in a nearby children?s hospital, and (e) train promising professionals in entrepreneurship and translational team science. This project will facilitate the fabrication of prototypes in a high-volume manufacturing environment that will outperform the current state-of-the-art medical tapes. In addition, highly skilled emerging professionals will receive training in the transition from pilot to high-volume product manufacturing and packaging.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Experiments in a high-fidelity driving simulator examine the ways that automated vehicle control affects drivers? sustained attention.  Other behavioral experiments examine factors that reduce people's ability to remain attentive.

This project uses novel experimental and analytic methods to identify the nature and causes of vigilance failures. The central goal is to isolate the roles of response bias, internal processing noise, and attentional lapses on the vigilance decrement. To do this, the project analyzes psychometric functions, curves that display signal detection rates task as a function of signal intensity, and are described by parameters that directly correspond to bias, noise, and lapse rate. The project examines how the form of the vigilance decrement varies with task characteristics that are believed to influence sustained attention, including task difficulty, mental rest, stimulus information format, and dual-task load. Performance is examined in laboratory tasks and in a simulated driving task.

The proposed innovative process uses hydrogen (H2) to directly reduce SPIOP in a high-temperature hydrogen reduction electric furnace to produce steel. The raw iron ore is first ground to a fine target size range (~0-0.076mm) to dissociate iron ore particles from gangue/impure particles such as quartz and rocks. The dissociated iron ore particles are then purified using the company?s high-intensity iron separation technologies. The purified iron ore concentrate is >99.0% purity.

Sylvatic (better known as bubonic) plague was introduced to North America in 1900 and is now maintained in native mammals in the western U.S., periodically eliciting disease outbreaks. Although some species seem to have natural resistance, others?such as prairie dogs?are highly susceptible. Despite the detection of plague resistance in a small number of prairie dogs, the disease still decimates populations throughout their range. The continued susceptibility of prairie dogs suggests there is some constraint inhibiting the widespread evolution of resistance to plague. This project uses whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing of resistant and susceptible prairie dogs to determine the genomic basis of recently evolved plague resistance. Mutations associated with resistance in natural populations and experiments will then be mapped in nature to determine the spatial distribution of resistance alleles and predict the location of potential resistance hotspots. Museum specimens of prairie dogs will also be genotyped to determine the rate of evolution of plague resistance. Given the increasing rate of novel pathogens emerging around the globe, this research will have broad implications for understanding when and where adaptation in nave hosts is likely to persist. This project will use research to enhance education by building capacity in universities serving Native American and Hispanic students. Traveling genomics workshops will be delivered to students and faculty, and students will be mentored at their own institutions as they conduct independent research in the system.<br/><br/>Adaptation to pathogens should be heavily favored by selection: Once immunity evolves, it should sweep to fixation across a species? range. Paradoxically, a more commonly observed pattern is variable immunity. Because there are multiple explanations for incomplete resistance, the ecological and evolutionary conditions under which resistance to novel pathogens is maintained are still poorly understood. For instance, to what extent does the habitat matrix influence the maintenance of resistance through processes such as gene dilution? Does the de novo evolution of resistance independently across populations lead to epistatic interactions preventing widespread resistance? Resistance to sylvatic plague (caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis) has been observed in prairie dogs (genus Cynomys) in six western states, but resistance is still rare. This project integrates genomic and transcriptomic analysis of experimentally infected animals with rangewide spatiotemporal sampling to elucidate how, when and where resistance evolves, and what prevents this adaptive trait from sweeping to fixation. Previous experimental infections and a natural epizootic will be used to determine the genomic basis of resistance in two species. Alleles associated with resistance, along with neutral alleles serving as a null model, will be genotyped in latitudinal transects spanning populations with different plague introduction times, and in museum specimens from at least three distinct time ranges. These data will enable estimates of the rate of evolution of resistance alleles and inferences of the landscape spatial structure and genomic characteristics facilitating resistance. Understanding how adaptation persists across space and time can enable facilitated adaptation in imperiled systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A recent global chemistry industry technology roadmap identified production of olefinic hydrocarbons (key molecular building blocks for polymer materials) as a standout opportunity in this regard. To that end, the project addresses a novel process scheme for converting light hydrocarbon alkanes to olefins.  The process is rooted in a tandem catalytic operation in which alkane dehydrogenation is coupled with selective hydrogen combustion (SHC) to decrease the energy demands, increase olefin yield, and decrease greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions compared to conventional alkane-to-olefin process technology.  The technical objectives are supported by a range of educational and outreach initiatives.<br/><br/>The project explores catalytic technology based on a new class of non-redox-active alkali metal formulations to selectively combust hydrogen in mixtures with hydrocarbon species. This research will systematically probe the structural and functional evolution of the alkali metal catalyst under high temperature conditions. The research aims to develop an understanding of mechanisms of oxygen activation and selective hydrogen combustion, probe kinetics of the underlying reactions, and ultimately determine the molecular characteristics that enable efficient alkane-to-olefin reaction via selective hydrogen combustion. The scientific objectives will be accomplished by (i) structural and chemical characterization of the alkali metal catalyst formulation using a combination of probe molecule adsorption and reaction studies, near ambient pressure X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and diffraction and microscopy methods; and (ii) identification and enumeration of radical species using probe molecule reactions and molecular beam mass spectrometry to determine the potential catalytic role of radical species.  Training, education, and outreach efforts as part of this research effort will emphasize the key role of science and engineering in paving next generation technologies for industrial manufacturing and will involve virtual after-school programs, lectures in a massive open online course, training at the undergraduate and graduate level, and development and dissemination of practices suited for safe operation of high temperature reactors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

How do they cause damage?  What causes some tornadoes to be intense and others weaker?  How can we build better to reduce the risks from tornadoes?  Observations in and near tornadoes are needed to better answer these questions. But, observations very near the ground, where people live, and inside tornadoes are very rare since they are difficult to predict and even harder to observe.  Some, rare, observations show that tornado winds can exceed 300 mph, and that the most intense winds are very near the ground, where they are especially hard to measure.  In order to mitigate the hazards posed by tornadoes, it is critical to better understand their basic structure and intensity.  The Boundary-layer Evolution and Structure of Tornadoes (BEST) project will address some of these questions, deploying mobile radars, Tornado Pods, and SwarmSonde balloons in and near tornadoes.  The goal is to resolve tornado structure, evolution, the intensity of winds, and the temperatures and humidities near tornadoes that likely affect how intense they are.  BEST will also examine decades of mobile radar and other data collected in and near tornadoes to better understand how strong, large, and potentially damaging they are.<br/><br/>BEST is a multi-focus study of tornado structure and evolution.  BEST plans a field phase during which unprecedentedly-fine scale kinematic and thermodynamic data will be collected by proximately-deployed DOW radars, Tornado Pods, and SwarmSonde lagrangian drifter balloons.  Dual-DOW baselines of 3-6 km will allow, for the first time, integrated mapping of tornado vector wind structures combined with detailed thermodynamic mapping provided with the densely-deployed Tornado Pods and SwarmSondes.  BEST will compare these new data with a unique database of DOW wind measurements over 200 unique tornadoes.  Approximately 20 of these include dual-Doppler vector wind resolving data.  One includes data from an extremely fortuitous 3 km - baseline dual-DOW deployment near a very large multi-vortex tornado, with dual-Doppler data uniquely resolving the structure and evolution of sub-tornado vortices.  A critical aspect of BEST is the combination of single-case study analysis of rare or very fortuitously observed events, with broader statistical analysis of several to over 200 events.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The conference has been a force in the mathematical life of topologists and geometers in the northeastern United States since 1963, providing an arena for the development and dissemination of a broad array of results from within algebraic, differential, and geometric topology and allied subjects. The activities are designed to encourage mathematical breadth and exchange of ideas between different branches of topology, as well as to welcome early career mathematicians into the field and promote interactions between junior and senior participants.   Each year, several of the talks cluster around one significant theme, in order to communicated a recent research development in one subarea to topologists across other areas, and to educate graduate students and early career researchers on a subject of recent interest.   Each iteration of the conference starts with a day of introductory talks by early junior speakers, and a colloquium talk on the history of the topic chosen for the main theme. It also includes a lightning session of short talks on exciting new research directions.  All of these activities serve to counter recent trends towards increasing specialization, by showcasing developments across inter-related fields at an accessible level.  <br/><br/>The area of interest for the 2023 conference will be recent developments in the theory of 4-manifolds, a topic with deep connections to geometric, algebraic, and symplectic topology and geometry.   About one third of the talks will be on this subject, in order to introduce topologists across sub-disciplines to this area in more detail than obtainable by attending a single talk or mini-course.  Possible future themes include: high dimensional negatively curved manifolds, trace methods, and homotopy type theory; although the organizers remain flexible should a new exciting development come to light elsewhere.  The remainder of talks at the conference showcase a broad range of recent developments in different areas of topology, selected with a view towards breadth.   Additionally, all speakers participate in a ?lightning round?  consisting of short pitches of recent exciting work by others and speculation on future trends. This gives a forward-looking perspective on new developments and stimulates discussion.  The opening introductory day of activities and graduate student talks provides a point of entry for interested non-experts and encourages graduate student involvement.  The broader impacts of the activities include a more broadly-trained community of topologists, able to transcend the boundaries of subspecialties; a more diverse mathematical workforce; a more rapid integration of younger topologists into areas of current research; and the enhancement of collaboration among researchers in different areas of topology.  The training effects of the conference will be extended by dissemination of lecture notes from the workshops and summaries of the panel discussion and problem session; the main vehicle for this is the conference web site, which has been maintained continuously since 1997.<br/><br/>https://e.math.cornell.edu/sites/topology/<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Brick-and-mortar retail is undergoing an unprecedented transformation, having lost billions of dollars over the past decade due to labor shortages, competition from e-commerce giants, and changing expectations from the modern consumer. To address these issues, retailers have been adopting new digital technologies to gain visibility into their inventory, optimize store operations, and gain customer insights. A key technology that has been adopted by over 90% of US retailers, is Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID). RFID tags are cheap, wireless, and battery-less stickers (similar to barcodes) that have allowed retailers to achieve accurate store-wide inventory, resulting in a significant revenue increase for retailers. In contrast to existing (portable) RFID technology which can only determine whether RFID-tagged items are<br/>in the store (i.e., inventory), the proposed technology aims to precisely locate these items throughout the store. The technology leverages billions of off-the-shelf ultra-high frequency (UHF) RFID tags that are already attached to clothing, footwear, and apparel items. In contrast to existing mobile solutions which can only detect RFID-tagged items, the team's handheld device leverages sophisticated signal excitation and processing techniques to pin down each RFID?s exact position with decimeter-scale accuracy. <br/><br/>This SBIR Phase 1 project will build a system capable of identifying and precisely locating RFID-tagged items and includes three main innovative components: (1) a portable, handheld wireless device for locating RFIDs, (2) a scalable cloud and edge computing platform to process and store the data, and (3) a mobile and web user interface for accessing the data and optimizing picking tasks for retail store associates. Realizing the end-to-end platform requires developing efficient sensor fusion algorithms and low-power, low-cost hardware for accurate, robust, and low-latency localization. This technology necessitates addressing challenges that arise from the computational, memory, bandwidth, and power constraints on the edge device. The platform also requires developing the split and cloud computing architecture to efficiently process data from multiple handheld devices in real-time as well as provide the generalizable application programming interfaces (APIs) to integrate this data pipeline with the retail customers. By the end of the Phase I period, the project will have piloted the fully-integrated system in a retail store to evaluate its real-world performance.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This technological solution significantly reduces disposal of plastic wastes in landfills. The novel approach turns a waste product into an asset. Further, the energy required for this new process is 7-10 times lower than the production of virgin resins from petroleum because the temperatures involved are lower than those in the current production processes (110-130 oC). The operation cost is lower than the petroleum-based polymers because no catalysts are used and the equipment cost is lower because standard equipment from chemical industry is used. Economic analysis has shown the technology to be cost effective at small-medium-large plant sizes. The following are the main benefits of this innovation: (1) prevention of disposal in landfills; (2) production of recyclable plastic products; (3) reduction of carbon footprint; and (4) lower costs. In addition, the societal benefits are the reduction of land used for landfills, the reduction in greenhouse gas generation, the reduction in ocean plastics, and an increased sustainability of materials.<br/><br/><br/>This project will enable the separation of most of the resins in plastic wastes using a sequence of solvents with each solvent specifically dissolving a specific resin. This process is based on molecular dynamic calculations that elucidate the interactions between the solvents and the polymers, accurately predicting and selecting solvents for specific polymers. The process has been verified experimentally at the bench scale. The key technological hurdle in scaling up the technology is integrating the various pilot scale components, high solvent recovery rate, and<br/>transition to the use of green solvents. The main advantage over the competition is the ability to generate solubility curves for any plastic resin in any solvent in a relatively short time.

Coupling molecular excitons to a quantized radiation field inside an optical cavity generates hybrid light-matter states, so called polaritons. Polariton chemistry has the potential to provide a new paradigm for enabling chemical transformations. Theoretical investigations play a vital role in understanding new knowledge and basic principles in this emerging field. Dr. Huo and his group are working to develop new quantum dynamics methods for accurate and direct simulations of polariton photochemical processes. With these new theoretical approaches, Dr. Huo and his team will investigate the dynamics of such molecule-cavity hybrid systems to glean information on the basic principles in polariton photochemistry. Dr. Huo will continue his 'Journey to the Molecular World' summer school for high school students in the Rochester City School District, which aims to inspire their curiosity and enthusiasm about molecular science. Dr. Huo will also collaborate with his colleagues to organize a new Telluride workshop on polariton chemistry, which will bring together experimentalists and theorists for exchanging the most recent scientific discoveries in polariton chemistry.<br/><br/>Accurately simulating the non-adiabatic dynamics of the molecule-cavity hybrid system remains a challenge and lies beyond the current scope of photochemistry and quantum optics. Existing approaches are often based on quantum optics model Hamiltonians that break down under the strong light-matter coupling regime, or mixed quantum-classical (MQC) simulations that have known deficiencies. To address these challenges, Dr. Huo and his group will develop new non-adiabatic methods that are based on the rigorous quantum electrodynamics Hamiltonian and provide accurate dynamics simulations compared to the commonly used MQC approaches. Dr. Huo and his team will also develop new on-the-fly simulation techniques based on the quasi-diabatic propagation scheme to perform ab-initio polariton non-adiabatic dynamics in realistic molecule-cavity hybrid systems. The proposed work aims to provide a set of transformative theoretical tools and frameworks that can accurately simulate real-time polaritonic quantum dynamics. These theoretical investigations have the potential to provide fundamental knowledge of quantum light-matter-interaction-induced chemistry and facilitate new discoveries in polariton chemistry, inspiring transformative design principles that take advantage of the intrinsic quantum behaviors of photons. Such fundamental knowledge and insight obtained from this theoretical work has the potential to profoundly impact catalysis, energy production, and the field of chemistry at large.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Resilience to these changes depends on interactions between environmental features, behavior, and physiology that enable species to access suitable microclimates. Ecosystem engineers are species that modify their environment by creating structures, such as burrows, which can provide more stable temperature and humidity, buffering occupants against temperature extremes. The actions of these organisms are important not only for their own persistence but to enable other species to access suitable microclimates. The Mojave desert tortoise is an ecosystem engineer that creates burrows for shelter and nesting and is threatened with extinction, in part due to climate change. The youngest tortoise life stages - eggs, hatchlings, and juveniles - are particularly vulnerable to temperature extremes due to their small size and limited ability to modify their environment. These life stages rely on maternal nest placement or small mammal burrows for protection. This project aims to understand how desert tortoises modify their environment through burrow creation, to characterize how thermoregulation is achieved via burrow use, and to measure the effectiveness of burrows to buffer against rising temperature across life stages, with a particular emphasis on nesting females and early life stages. This research will provide new data on the resiliency of each life stage to climate extremes and will inform life stage-specific models of species distribution under future climate scenarios, identifying sites that may become climate refugia. This work will develop grade-specific educational modules and classroom kits that integrate active desert tortoise conservation research and will implement these modules in local classrooms. This project will also provide training opportunities for K-12 teachers, undergraduate students, a graduate student, and a post-doctoral trainee. This project is being supported via a joint program involving the Divisions of Environmental Biology and Integrative Organismal Systems and the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation.<br/><br/>This research takes a mechanistic approach to evaluate the role of behavioral and physiological flexibility in determining resilience to climate change for the endangered Mojave desert tortoise across life stages, an important ecosystem engineer. The research seeks to characterize temperature sensitivity of eggs and maternal nesting behavior; test the effects of temperature and hydric status on juvenile burrow use, burrow morphology, and body temperature; quantify the thermal buffering capacity of behavior and burrows across age classes in wild tortoises; and use respirometry to characterize temperature effects on energy expenditure, water loss and thermal preference. These studies will provide key physiological parameters for life stage-specific mechanistic niche models (MNMs) of response to altered climate to identify optimal habitat for desert tortoises that will persist into the future. Finally, this research will test MNM predictions by collecting environmental data from model-selected sites. By identifying climate refugia and core conservation areas, these models will inform future focal sites for Mojave desert tortoise recovery activities, including restoration and assisted migration. More broadly, results will be relevant for the extended group of burrowing species and commensal organisms that use burrows, and lead to improved empirical and modelling methods for forecasting the impacts of climate change on this diverse group of organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In the ocean, which sustains half of global photosynthesis and oxygen supply, P can be scarce enough to constrain biological productivity, carbon dioxide uptake, and therefore climate. Human activity is accelerating the delivery of nutrients like P to the ocean, but rates of nitrogen inputs are even greater. This imbalance may increase levels of P stress in marine ecosystems, placing ocean productivity more and more under the control of P supply. Given the critical role of P in sustaining ocean health and ecosystem services now and into the future, a comprehensive understanding of its utilization and fate in the marine environment is necessary. In this project, the research team investigates marine polyphosphate (polyP), a ubiquitous yet poorly understood form of P made by all living organisms. To close major knowledge gaps on marine polyP, the investigators are overcoming major technical barriers to produce the first quantitative measurements of polyP in marine microorganisms. These measurements are being conducted on laboratory microbial cultures, as well as field samples from environments with high P supply, such as the California Current Ecosystem, or very low P supply, such as the Mediterranean Sea. In addition, the research team is resolving the cellular function of marine polyP across these different organisms and environments in order to clarify its role in biological P nutrition. This work helps advance polyP research across disciplines, including terrestrial science and even cancer research, and has broad application to P bioremediation. This project supports a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and several undergraduate students in the labs of two female scientists. New educational tools to teach the public about marine polyP are being produced and disseminated through this project. A K12 teacher is participating in the work and communicating the findings to their classrooms and to broad audiences online.<br/><br/>PolyP is ubiquitous in marine systems, where it plays critical roles in microbial P nutrition and P mineral formation and sequestration. In these ways, polyP has the potential to shape long- and short-term marine P cycling, primary productivity, microbial ecology, and global climate. However, major knowledge gaps still exist. Due to technical limitations, the scientific community currently lacks a quantitative understanding of marine polyP pools, their chain lengths, and biological origins. Furthermore, given the view of polyP as a P storage molecule, recent observations pointing to the preferential retention of particulate polyP in low phosphate (Pi) environments raise new questions about its ecophysiological functions. To close these knowledge gaps, two research questions are addressed: Q1: What is the total content and chain length distribution of polyP across different microbial groups and environmental conditions? Q2: How do the production of particulate polyP contribute to microbial P demand and stoichiometry across a broad range in Pi availability? The following hypotheses are tested: H1 (Q1): Functionally and environmentally diverse plankton produce a broad range of polyP chain lengths and concentrations. H2 (Q2): The preferential retention of polyP in low Pi environments can be reconciled with its role as a P storage molecule by a combination of taxonomic and physiological factors. These hypotheses are tested in the laboratory using representative cultures of marine plankton and in the field using observational approaches along natural Pi gradients in the Pacific Ocean and Mediterranean Sea. Applying a new P-targeted method using mass spectrometry, the team is resolving an unprecedented level of detail in marine polyP content and speciation. By combining cell sorting with elemental, biochemical, and radiotracer analyses, the team is gaining a mechanistic understanding of polyP physiology and its cycling in the ocean.<br/><br/>This project is supported by the Biological Oceanography and Chemical Oceanography Programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Sarazen of Princeton University is studying selective oxidation reactions that are central in a variety of pharmaceutical, fine chemical, and other chemical industry processes. Specifically, this work is directed at the design of advanced catalysts with high reactivity, selectivity, and stability that can efficiently and sustainably address our growing energy and product demands through combined synthesis, characterization, and reaction analysis. Metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) are a class of materials attractive for many chemistries, including oxidations. This proposal aims to provide understanding of how MOFs behave under model operating conditions, their deactivation pathways, and their reactivation. If successful, the results of these studies will help guide further research, not only in catalysis but also for other applications such as gas capture and separations, energy storage, drug delivery, and sensors. Additional implications for commercial sustainability from understanding material limitations can improve existing materials in terms of thermochemical robustness and stability, and reducing waste from spent catalysts. Similarly, this work prioritizes sustainable practices by considering cheaper and more abundant metals and more benign oxidants compared to many current industrial processes. PI Sarazen will continue her engagement in scientific outreach and educational programs that aim to increase diversity within the scientific community through demonstrations in on-/off-campus outreach events that utilize these catalysts in the oxidation of dye molecules found in wastewater, offering exciting, vibrant color changes that can be used to promote the power of catalyst applications and public scientific literacy on sustainable industrial chemistry. <br/><br/>This project involves the study of liquid-phase oxidation reactions valuable for industrial applications through experimental and computational characterizations. The regularly distributed metal centers in open crystalline MOF networks will be used to build structure-function relations and elucidate reaction and deactivation mechanisms during representative oxidation reactions of 1-octene, where rigorous kinetic experiments will be coupled with characterization techniques and computational modelling. Specifically, this proposed work will investigate physicochemically tunable Fe-based MIL MOFs during hydrogen peroxide-assisted oxidation of conformationally and synthetically modular 1-octene to quantify the impacts of pore hydrophobicity, acidity, and Fe active site coordination sphere perturbations on observed reactivity, selectivity, and stability. The results of this experimental study will motivate computational investigations with density functional theory by taking advantage of the crystalline nature of MOFs and could develop trends that predict promising material compositions or methods to improve existing materials for a desired application. The framework described here for studying entire catalytic lifecycles, including specific mechanistic details for oxidation reactions on Fe-carboxylate MOFs, has the potential to provide a foundation that can be extended to improve catalyst efficiency for other reactions of various feedstocks related to hydrocarbon and oxygenate processing from carbon upgrading (petroleum/biomass/waste refining) over different MOF architectures and even different energy (i.e., electrocatalytic, photocatalytic) inputs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The SLS has a rich history of bringing together junior and established researchers in cutting edge areas of mathematics and statistics with the goal of educating and elevating the next generation of talent. Turbulent mixing is a subject of broad importance in physics, engineering, geosciences and mathematics. Over the course of five lecturers, the principal speaker for the series, Anna Mazzucato, will introduce fundamental elements of the mathematical study of turbulent mixing and present state of the art results. Additionally, there will be ten one-hour lectures by invited speakers on related topics as well as a poster session by young researchers. A career panel will be included to foster the career development of junior participants. Finally, a public lecture presented by Lisette de Pillis will present the art and applications of mathematical modeling at a level suited to a broad audience. <br/><br/>When a tracer is carried by a turbulent incompressible flow, it is rapidly dispersed throughout the fluid medium, that is, it becomes mixed. This dynamic is important to many areas of research, including atmospheric and oceanographic science, biology, and chemistry. Recently, major mathematical developments have improved society's understanding of mixing. These advances connect disciplines within analysis, namely partial differential equations (PDE), dynamical systems, and geometric measure theory. Results of this progress have been used to explore other problems in the analysis of PDE, such as the loss of regularity for transport equations. The lectures will present the mathematical fundamentals behind these processes as well as advanced results by the principal and invited speakers in order to provide participants with a broad and current perspective on the field.

However, this technique is difficult for data collected on the seafloor which is nearly 70% of the Earth?s surface. This project implements a new approach for oceanic datasets. Hypotheses will be tested about what drives mantle flow and how magmas reach volcanoes. An undergraduate student will help with data analysis and the method will be released for wide use.<br/><br/>Observations of shear-wave splitting (SWS) provide a first-order constraint on the geodynamics of the lithosphere-asthenosphere system. This project will investigate three science questions. 1) Do the motions of the plates on the Earth?s surface or internal convective forces drive flow in the oceanic asthenosphere? 2) Do mantle plumes drive a radial pattern of flow beneath tectonic plates, or are plumes captured by forces in the lithosphere-asthenosphere system? 3) Does the melt generated beneath mid-ocean ridges get segregated by shear into bands, or does the melt not interact with the background strain field? Addressing these questions at present is made difficult by the challenges involved in making SWS observations with ocean-bottom seismometers. A method is proposed to address two key challenges faced by traditional methods in oceanic environments ? complex depth-varying anisotropy and low signal-to-noise ratios. Preliminary results at both the NoMelt site and Galapagos Archipelago show major improvements relative to more traditional approaches. The methodology will be converted to the Julia programming language for use by the community. The methodology implemented by this proposal increases the return from ocean-bottom seismometer experiments - both domestic and international - by increasing the number of datasets that return good SWS results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

LASV is a member of the Arenavirus family that is currently endemic to West Africa, and there is an increasing incidence of LASV infection reported worldwide. The pandemic potential of LASV has already been noted by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2018, which stated that the virus requires urgent and prioritized research. Membrane fusion is a key component of the LASV lifecycle that allows the virus to deliver its genetic information into the target cell through a chemical process that is not well understood. The process is thought to be facilitated by specialized fusion machinery that undergoes structural transitions triggered by specific environmental conditions. One such example of this machinery is the fusion domain (FD), which is predominately associated with the initiation of membrane fusion. The research aims to identify, on a molecular level, exactly how the FD initiates the process of membrane fusion. Such information is often a prerequisite for novel therapeutic design that may serve to arrest the viral lifecycle and prevent and/or treat LASV infection. Simultaneously, an educational outreach program will be implemented focused on providing opportunities for incoming transfer students as well as local high school students to gain practical scientific research experience. The aim of the program is to improve both the retention and enrollment of students within the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields.<br/><br/>The initiation of LASV membrane fusion relies on the FD, which resides within the viral glycoprotein found on the viral surface. This domain is well conserved across the Arenavirus family and is also structurally distinct, containing both an N-terminal fusion peptide (FP) and an internal fusion loop (FL). The overarching goal of the research is to understand how the underlying chemistry of the FD contributes to the initiation of membrane fusion. Specifically, the structural and functional roles of multiple fusogenic regions within the LASV FD and the impacts of environmental conditions will be examined. A cyclic approach will be employed utilizing solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy to elucidate the structural rearrangement of the LASV FD.  The NMR work will be complemented by thermodynamic and kinetic investigations through isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and in vitro lipid mixing fusion assays. The framework mentioned allows the investigation of the FD as both a peptide and within the context of the full viral glycoprotein. The latter requires a novel approach involving specific labeling and incorporation into a lipid bilayer, both of which will be implemented in order to provide more physiological relevance. Upon conclusion of the research, a major knowledge gap regarding LASV membrane fusion will be filled and a framework for studying other viral FDs will be established.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed innovation is expected to have impacts in several areas including security of modern connected vehicles, transportation safety, national security, and automotive Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEM). With the advent and proliferation of autonomous and connected vehicles, the market size for OEMs and their in-vehicle (IVN) technologies is rapidly growing and is expected to maintain a growth trajectory to about $46 billion dollars. Automotive cyberthreat analysis, detection, and localization is an integral component of this growing market. The proposed innovation has the potential to save about $300 million dollars for automotive suppliers and OEMs over the next 5 years. The benefits of the innovation to society at large are significant in the areas including transportation safety, automotive industry, and the cyber insurance business.  <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of security solutions to safeguard modern automobile in-vehicle networks (IVNs) against a wide array of cyberattacks.  The proposed technology uses physics-based attack detection and localization in a simultaneous manner.  Currently, using the existing engine control unit (ECU) diagnosis technologies, the vehicle ECU and in-vehicle cybersecurity engineers spend about 30 minutes to 1 hour for each vehicle to scan for potential security issues in IVNs.  The proposed technology uses a physical fingerprinting framework consisting of embedded hardware devices and completely automatic in-vehicle network traffic analyzing algorithms to detect and localize malicious activities happening within the connected IVNs.  This IVN cybersecurity tool, may protect the modern automobile IVNs against the ever-increasing number of cyberthreats and help the cybersecurity manager of OEMs and automotive suppliers to defend the IVNs of their products against the growing number of cyberattacks in a time- and cost-efficient manner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plants are rooted in place and are therefore continually assaulted by both biotic and abiotic stressors in nature while also striving to grow and reproduce.  As the world population continues to grow in a changing climate, the ability to ensure food security relies on a better understanding of how plant cells make the appropriate response to signals from their environment. This project uses pollination and tip-growing cells as model systems for dissecting how plant cells perceive signals from other cells and scale their responses to promote beneficial interactions and discourage harmful interactions. This research has the potential to impact society by leading to new approaches for enhancing beneficial plant-biotic interactions in the extreme environments that plants will face if global climate change continues at its current pace. In addition to training the next generation of scientists through direct participation of undergraduates, graduate students, and a postdoc, this project will also enhance STEM participation and education of underrepresented minorities at the high school level through a summer educational outreach and mentoring program at an inner city community center.<br/><br/>Receptor-like kinases (RLKs) play key roles in perceiving and reacting to external signals secreted from an invading organism or cell wall perturbations that result from attempted invasions. FERONIA (FER) and related RLKs have been proposed to be sensors of extracellular perturbations that trigger a signal transduction cascade that results in communication with the invading cell. In pollination, one outcome of FER signaling is the signal-mediated trafficking of the MLO protein NORTIA to a polarized membrane domain in the synergid cells of the female gametophyte. FER-mediated trafficking of MLO proteins to discrete polar membrane domains may act as a mechanism to turn up the volume on the extracellular response. However, knowledge is lacking on the extent to which MLO proteins act as amplifiers of FER signaling in other parts of the plant. The overall objective of this project is to understand the link between RLK signaling and MLO accumulation and function at polarized membrane domains. The central hypothesis is that MLO amplification of FER signals to the extracellular space is a common mechanism in RLK regulation of both plant-biotic interactions at polarized membrane domains and polarized cell expansion and acts to modulate the cellular response to external signals. The overall objective will be met through three specific aims: 1) testing conservation of the FER/MLO signaling module in plant-biotic interactions and tip-growing cells; 2) determining the intersection of FER and MLO activities in polarized membrane domains; and 3) identifying new proteins involved in MLO function in polarized membrane domains.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The rationale for this activity is that synthetic data generation is a rapidly growing and highly disciplinary research area that draws much attention. For the development of algorithmic procedures for fraud deception and spam identification, as well as for the construction of AI-driven models in manufacturing and supply chain management, synthetic data has become a valuable resource. The goal of this workshop is to investigate scientific foundations that are spawned by these advancements and examine new strategies for solving open problems.

What issues do reviewers focus on? Do authors rebut and/or implement some of these comments more than others? Peer review is a social process where reviewers and authors exchange competing arguments about the merits of new scientific work. In these exchanges, authors advance new arguments in their submissions, which are critically evaluated by peer reviewers who contest some of these arguments and affirm others. Authors then respond to these reviews with counter-arguments, sometimes conceding and other times refuting. This process of peer review - the exchange of argument, evaluation, and response ? is a social, institutional means of shaping what is published as scientific knowledge. This project will systematically depict this exchange process and its variation, revealing how different fields establish socially accepted knowledge claims. We intend to do this by: representing the hierarchical logical dependencies of scientific arguments; discerning distinct expressions of epistemological value; and developing a method that identifies where and when such evaluations are intertextually represented. When these patterns of exchange and evaluation are viewed in the aggregate, they will offer authors, reviewers, editors, and field participants a means by which to observe these hidden epistemological deliberations, to reflect on their merits, and to potentially help participants advocate for improvements in peer review. The techniques we develop should also enable social scientists to systematically study evaluative exchanges more generally, and this approach can be used to see how evaluative norms are practiced in different social and institutional contexts.<br/><br/>Using tens of thousands of evaluative exchanges and nearly 100,000 scholarly texts of OpenReview and JSTOR, we will systematically study evaluative exchanges among peer scholars over the course of three interrelated phases: how authors advance arguments, how peers evaluate and review them, and how authors counterargue and revise their manuscript in response to those reviews. We will apply natural language processing techniques including discourse parsing, rhetorical structural theory, and network analysis to investigate evaluative exchanges in both private peer reviews and public review-and-responses. The work has three aims: first, to discover the semantic structure of scientific arguments and how they vary within and across distinct scholarly fields. This entails understanding the kinds of claims, warrants, and evidence scientists use to debate; how these are interrelated in network forms or structures; and how certain forms in turn are specific to different scientific cultures. Second, we aim to discover the latent inter-textual structure of scientific arguments and, in particular, how responding scientists forge arguments that rearrange, omit, or even emphasize the semantic relations of other scientists? arguments as laid out in texts. This entails innovating ?text as data? methods in order to observe and measure discrete connections across disparate texts. Finally, we aim to understand the conditions under which scientists change their minds: how their arguments get revised and how resolution is achieved. This entails understanding whether and to what extent argument structures are updated or aligned by counter- or responding arguments. <br/><br/>The project is co-funded by the Science of Science: Discovery, Communications, and Impact and the Human Networks and Data Science Programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These diseases stem from the natural age-associated deterioration of bodily function but it is unclear how deterioration across systems ? for example, bone loss and decreased immune system function ? are related. It also remains to be determined whether patterns of aging and age-associated disease in humans are further impacted by a mismatch between contemporary and ancestral environments. Key influences on individual differences in patterns of aging and timing of onset of age-related disease remain to be uncovered. This project studies wild-living non-human primates to examine the biological systems that deteriorate with age, and drills down into the mechanisms behind individual differences in the rate of aging. This study contributes valuable comparative data on aging that deepens an understanding of human aging patterns through identifying specific social and life course factors associated with age-related disease. This project supports the training and professional development of a postdoctoral researcher and multiple undergraduate students, local community outreach and engagement, and science outreach in K-12 schools in the U.S.<br/><br/>This project builds on over fifteen prior years of data collection on the same populations, which provides a rich context of behavioral and demographic data from over 100 individuals. Social adversity in early life and adulthood, cumulative reproductive effort, and multiple markers of biological aging are included predictors of aging patterns and outcomes. The main aims of the project are to identify: 1) the trajectory of aging across the life course with respect to physical deterioration (as measured by bone and muscle loss), physiological dysregulation (as indexed by hormone and immune markers), and molecular hallmarks of aging, and compare the results with existing datasets on aging from humans and other nonhuman primates; 2) the factors and timing that exert the strongest influence on inter-individual differences in the pace of biological aging, including social status, traumatic changes in social group membership, poor social integration, and increased reproductive effort. By coupling a rich longitudinal dataset with cutting edge methods in physiology, medical imaging, molecular techniques, and comparative methods, this study adds to a small, but growing number of nonhuman primate models of aging in wild populations that can build an informative context for understanding the evolution of, and variation in, human aging and aging-related deterioration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Not accounting for such high correlation over time leads to wrong conclusions. Economists have therefore developed methods to correct for such correlation when drawing conclusions from data that are highly correlated over time.  There are no methods to correct for strong correlation among economic variables that are measured at different locations, such as income, housing prices, or crime rates, across different US commuting zones.  This research develops new methods to correct for strong correlation among economic variables across space to help researchers make correct inference.  The research develops a formal framework to study such effects, derives tests to detect strong spatial correlation, and suggest methods to restore valid conclusions from strongly correlated spatial data. Since strongly correlated spatial data is quite common, this research could have important implications for how to draw correct empirical conclusions in the social sciences and beyond.  The results of this research will improve policy making that involves consideration of space, such as housing and crime policies in US urban areas.<br/><br/>This research uses four projects to investigate the consequences of ""unit root""-type strong spatial dependence.  The suggested methods echo corresponding concepts and results in the time series literature: The project suggests a model for general spatial ""unit-root""-type I(1) processes; it then establishes a Functional Central Limit Theorem justifying a large sample Gaussian process approximation for such I(1) processes. The I(1) model is then generalized to a spatial ""local-to-unity"" model that exhibits long-range, stationary dependence as well as  characterize the large sample behavior of regression inference with spatial I(1) variables and establish that spurious regression is as much a problem with spatial I(1) data as it is with time series I(1) data. Finally, the research develops asymptotically valid spatial unit root and stationarity tests, inference for the local-to-unity parameter, and suggest strategies for obtaining valid inference in regressions with persistent (I(1) or local-to-unity) spatial processes.  Besides contributions to the econometrics literature, the results of this research will improve policy making, especially urban policies, where spatial dependence tends to be very strong.

Infants may experience significant stress even if they survive an attack. Stressors can cause the developing gut microbiota to destabilize, which may negatively affect host digestion and immunity. The team investigates whether gut microbiota changes are long-lasting or if they can be overcome with stable environments later in life. The project advances research experiences for researchers and provides training opportunities in genetic laboratory methods for undergraduate and graduate students. Research results are communicated to site managers and the local community at the field location, contributing to primate management plans and local conservation efforts of critically endangered wild primates. <br/><br/>This project examines how gut microbiota development associates with ecological and social stressors experienced early in life. Leveraging 15 years of data from a wild population of the critically endangered primate Colobus vellerosus, the researchers investigate: 1) whether adverse conditions (i.e., low food availability, loss of maternal kin, alpha male takeovers, and elevated infanticide risk) predict infant gut microbiota composition; and 2) whether these adverse conditions, either currently experienced and/or experienced as an infant, predict the gut microbiota during juvenescence, subadulthood, or adulthood. Ecological and demographic data are used to determine food abundance, competition for food, alpha male takeovers, infanticide risk, and presence of maternal kin. The composition of the gut microbiota is determined from 16S rRNA gene sequencing using C. vellerosus fecal samples from infants and from individuals at later age life stages with known infancy conditions. The project addresses relationships between early life and gut microbiota in infancy and whether these potential changes associated with adverse conditions in infancy persist into later life stages.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The modern human craniofacial complex has evolved to become smaller, with shorter midface and globular brain shape, characteristics linked to changes in diet and chewing. Previous investigations of this topic using bone in comparative and fossil materials have methodological limitations. Here, a novel combination of state-of-the-art imaging methods is used to analyze changes in bone and soft tissues during craniofacial development. The research has the potential to inform public health research on early life development. The project fosters student training and mentoring in STEM, and resulting data are disseminated through publications, presentations, and publicly available imaging databases. <br/><br/>The project uses a gracilized comparative model to examine the influence of early and typical weaning on musculoskeletal craniofacial development. The specific aims of this project are to characterize the effects of (1) craniofacial gracilization and (2) early weaning on musculoskeletal performance, integration, and symmetry during the stages of oral motor skill development in early life. Previous research has focused on changes in skeletal tissue, primarily due to limitations in what is visible in a standard CT and what is preserved in the fossil record. A novel combination of contrast enhanced micro-computed tomography (micro-CT) methods is used in this project to analyze ontogenetic series of bone, muscle, and cartilage. This multilevel research design incorporates evolutionary, behavioral, morphological, and functional theories, allowing greater understanding of the impact of function and tissue interactions on the musculoskeletal development in the craniofacial complex. Furthermore, this project can improve our understanding of the form-function interrelationships in the craniofacial complex during highly plastic early life stages, with implications for behavioral adaptations and growth trajectories during human evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A tenet of neuroscience is that higher-order computations are performed by neural circuits in the central nervous system (CNS), not the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, this might not be universally true for all types of animals.  This project examines whether olfactory processing circuitry in a mollusc is found in the PNS rather than the CNS, as it is in other animal phyla such as vertebrates and insects. The project uses the nudibranch mollusc, Berghia stephanieae, which is a charismatic lab-grown species that is an inexpensive alternative to many other neuroscience laboratory species, thereby increasing access to research for students. Berghia, like other gastropod molluscs has large, individually identifiable neurons in its CNS. However, like its distant cousin, the octopus, far more small neurons are located in its PNS, which contains peripheral ganglia and sub-epithelial neurons. Anthropocentricism has biased researchers to believe that the brain is more important than the periphery. However, this might not be true for all types of nervous systems. Determining the extent to which peripheral systems in molluscs perform computations that were thought to be reserved for the brain could transform our view of what actually constitutes a brain.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to elucidate the neural architecture and function of the peripheral rhinophore complex, which consists of the rhinophore, a dorsal cephalic appendage used for distance chemoreception, and the associated rhinophore ganglion. A connectomics and transcriptomics approach will be used to determine whether there are glomeruli in the rhinophore complex that are organized like olfactory glomeruli in the olfactory bulb of vertebrates and the antennal lobe of insects. There are three objectives: 1) A connectome of the rhinophore ganglion will be constructed from volume serial electron microscopic images using machine-learning algorithms to determine the neural circuit motifs that it contains. Customization of machine-learning algorithms to the ultrastructural features of Berghia will facilitate connectomics research in other molluscs. 2) An atlas of neuronal types will be assembled, which will include neurons in the rhinophore complex and neurons that input to it. Neural gene expression, determined from single cell RNA sequencing, will be mapped using in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and axon tracing. A web portal will provide access to the annotated connectome and neuronal atlas, allowing researchers and students to explore genes, neurons, and neural circuitry in Berghia. 3) The role of the rhinophore complex in navigational behavior will be explored with behavioral assays and selective lesions, taking advantage of Berghia?s regenerative abilities. Laboratory courses developed using Berghia will allow undergraduate students to label and image neurons with HCR and IHC and perform behavioral experiments with automated tracking. This will enable students to make discoveries and test hypotheses regarding neurons and neural circuits in parallel to the discoveries made by laboratory researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Pandemics demand that governments respond to the public health crisis to curb the spread of the virus and prevent excess death.  The aim of this project is to see if these closures affected people?s visits to establishments, and in turn, whether their visits slowed or accelerated the spread of the SARS-CoV-2 virus, cause of COVID-19 disease.  To study this, cell-phone data that recorded visits to a variety of neighborhood establishments from February 1, 2020 to February 28, 2022 are used.  First examined is whether local governments? closures of businesses affected people?s visiting patterns and if this was contingent on the political atmosphere, built environment, and composition of the metropolitan area and neighborhoods.  Second examined is whether visits to establishments both within and outside the neighborhood relate to case rates within the neighborhood over time.  The results of this research will inform public health departments and local governments on the effectiveness of this kind of NPI and the role that these visits to establishments play in the spread of an infectious disease like SARS-CoV-2.  <br/><br/>This study examines twelve urban areas with different pandemic profiles, i.e., those that had few and multiple NPIs and high and low infections during the study period.  Data examined are case rates at the zip code level and NPIs from various web sources that describe cases and initiatives at the zip, city, county, and state levels.  These data are paired with data from the Census Bureau?s American Community Survey (ACS) on neighborhood demographics and weekly SafeGraph data on visits to neighborhood establishments and travel patterns across neighborhoods.  The latter are based on the presence of cell phones at the sites of specific establishments within an urban zip code and also tell how long patrons visited these establishments.  The SafeGraph data also have information on the ?home? block group of those who visited establishments.  This enables knowledge of where residents of a given zip code traveled during the pandemic and if their visiting habits subsequently affected case rates in their home zip code.  Weekly data on 29 different types of establishments are included.  Analysis is through application of a fixed-slope multilevel model with spatial dependence error term.  This research permits elucidation of how different kinds of public health decisions, especially with regard to business closures, relate to health outcomes across areas.  Since closures are so impactful for the economy and personal well-being, understanding which types of organizations contributed more to the spread of SARS-CoV-2 throughout the pandemic will help inform data driven public health decisions that limit the activity of different businesses and organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To understand outcomes after aortic valve replacement procedures, especially related to clot formation, experimental protocols to emulate cardiovascular performance and operation have been established. Because of the challenges associated with performing laboratory experiments with whole human blood, blood substitutes are generally used. The majority of blood substitutes are Newtonian mixtures, whereas blood is non-Newtonian. A non-Newtonian fluid is a fluid that is characterized by a viscosity that varies with shear rate. This effect becomes important in areas that are subjected to flow stagnation and therefore thrombosis, which current experiments do not fully consider. Therefore, the aim of this project is to understand the impact of non-Newtonian behavior on the surrounding flow dynamic environment. The project will also encompass significant educational activities, including undergraduate involvement and an outreach program for students in local communities. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to find an adequate blood substitute with non-Newtonian properties to accurately model blood?s interactions with the surrounding aortic root anatomy, mainly the sinus and neo-sinus, under various physiological conditions in benchtop flow testing chambers. Then, experiments to characterize the resulting flow properties in the aortic root will be performed using high-fidelity imaging tools consisting of particle image velocimetry. The influence of non-Newtonian rheology on flow stagnation assessment under pulsatile physiological conditions, such as cardiovascular applications, is an underexplored territory. We aim to address that using two specific aims: (i) preparing and developing a non-Newtonian blood analog solution and testing its rheological properties and (ii) assessing the effects of non-Newtonian properties on flow stasis under pulsatile conditions after valve implantation. The research described in this proposal is novel in that, the sinus and neo-sinus flows after valve replacement will be experimentally evaluated using non-Newtonian blood analogs and a comparison between resulting flow stasis properties such as velocity, shear stress, and washout that are associated with thrombosis in Newtonian versus non-Newtonian fluids will be established. The project would contribute to further the understanding of hemostasis-related thrombosis, a scientific area that is constantly growing.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This therefore promotes the need for enhanced understanding of carbon sequestration and transport in the ocean.  Given the importance of oceanic sequestration and the global crisis due to the greenhouse effect, an accurate assessment of carbon flux into the deep ocean is imperative. Despite this need, our capability to calculate the transport of marine snow, a major mechanism for carbon storage, has lagged.  A now classic review in 1988 (Aldridge and Silver) outlined the importance of marine snow from many points of view, including both the production and the presence of microbial activity.  Interestingly, they state ?The greatest challenge to the study of marine snow at present is the development of appropriate technology to measure abundances and characteristics of aggregates in situ.?  That challenge remains today.  Among the most promising techniques are optical methods.  However, advances are needed to enable the optimal translation of imaged marine snow into carbon content and sinking velocities.  Specifically, an underwater vehicle is needed that will solve the problem that has vexed the estimate of marine snow descent rates by creating a vehicle that is both ?going with the flow? and, at the same time, measuring particle vertical descent velocity.  Based on this need, the project goal is to develop a reasonably priced device for measuring carbon flux. <br/> <br/>To achieve this goal, a relatively inexpensive (~$10k) autonomous, underwater, self-ballasting vehicle with an onboard optical imaging system will be designed and tested.  Necessary developments to accomplish this goal are the design, fabrication, and test of a vehicle that can both ?see? and ?track? particles as they descend throughout the water column without affecting their descent rate.  First, the optical imaging system will be tested with water samples obtained from different depths at sea.  The researchers will then optimize the imaging system by testing cameras and a variety of lighting options.  Considering vehicle design, a vital aspect is to provide images of sinking particles without affecting their descent rate.  The researchers will therefore test several vehicle configurations in deep tanks that are filled with appropriately sized particles while the vehicle is moved up and down.  A positive result will be the observation of undisturbed particles.  Another important aspect of the development cycle will be to create control software that will adjust vehicle buoyancy to follow particles as they sink, thereby maintaining the particles in the field of view of the camera system. Again, the researchers will test this with particle seeded deep tanks. Following successful hardware development and lab tests, the researchers will conduct sea tests to judge the vehicle?s capability to track descending particles.  The ensuing data set will be made available to the community.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, national and disciplinary reports highlight a disconnect between two-year college instructors and their respective disciplinary societies. This project will facilitate and evaluate a multi-stage virtual workshop that includes participants from disciplinary societies and two-year college faculty to enhance two-year college disciplinary engagement and raise awareness of funding opportunities applicable to two-year colleges. The workshop will be significant in supporting the development of discipline-specific action plans, exploring cross-disciplinary possibilities, and identifying ways to sustain two-year faculty involvement in disciplinary societies. <br/><br/>The virtual workshop will include 60 to 75 participants from 12 disciplines from multiple institutions and will consist of two synchronous two-day meetings with asynchronous work in between. The goal will be for participants to develop and initiate discipline-specific and cross-disciplinary action plans that enhance the involvement of two-year college faculty in their respective disciplinary societies. During the first two days of the workshop, participants will participate in active plenary sessions, develop discipline-specific action plans and explore multi-discipline STEM-focused projects. Then, asynchronously over several months, teams will receive feedback, revise action plans, and begin implementation. Finally, during the last two days of the workshop, teams will present and receive feedback on action plans and learn more about external funding opportunities. Cross-disciplinary teams will also engage in discussions regarding initiating and sustaining ongoing support for partnerships between two-year colleges and disciplinary societies. The project will be evaluated through surveys and project artifacts and will advance understanding of how organizational identity influences change processes. The project website and the associated report will be distributed to all participants, professional disciplinary societies, and will be available to all in the professional and academic scientific community.

Growing and erupting teeth are among the most transformative drivers of changes in facial appearance, promoting bone formation and influencing overall jaw growth. Prior research has focused on the eruption of ?baby teeth?, or deciduous teeth, and subsequent permanent teeth. However, the period near or at birth, when many teeth are not yet fully developed, has rarely been studied. This study investigates the role(s) of teeth in facial development during early critical periods, and results inform a better understanding regarding how different parts of anatomy can influence the appearance of others, as well as the whole organism. The project generates 3D models, a website and other resources for K-12 students and provides training and professional development to one postdoctoral scholar and multiple graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This study investigates the underpinnings of functional matrix theory, which posits that bones that border soft tissue structures and other organs such as teeth, directly cause transformations of bone morphology. The principal investigators use the two sides of lower jaw to study cellular and tissue-level event in tooth and jaw formation, which are then mirrored on three-dimensional reconstructions of the opposite side of the jaw. The three-dimensional reconstructions are accomplished using micro computed tomographic (CT) scanning to detect bone, following by a second scan after soaking half of the jaw in iodine, after which unmineralized tooth germs are easily detectable using CT. Amira software are used to generate three-dimensional views that denote critical cellular and tissue-level mechanisms (i.e., cell signals for bone deposition and resorption, and bone cell maturation). CT will also be used for morphometric analyses. Ultimately, by investigating how developing teeth compete for space within a growing face, results are relevant for interpreting variation in modern and past anatomy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The O?odham Language Center (OLC), conceived and directed by personnel from Tohono O?odham Community College, directly aligns with the TEA Center concept in the significant positive impacts it will have on the Tohono O?odham Nation in reclaiming the O?odham language. Using a cross-generational approach, the OLC will strive to perpetuate the language through the delivery of language immersion programs at Head Start Centers on the reservation in a manner designed to develop the language fluency of pre-K students who are citizens of the O?odham Nation. A slate of comprehensive activities will be undertaken that includes the engagement of community instructors fluent in the O?odham language and assisting students? families in developing their own fluency in support of the overarching goal of reclaiming their Indigenous language.<br/><br/>The OLC will employ evidenced-based pedagogical methods in the language immersion programs while customizing the curriculum for the specific school and community settings in which activities will occur. The work will be focused initially in three Head Start Centers that have foundational elements of a language program already in place. As the instructional model is optimized over time, the work will expand to include all six of the Head Start Centers on the Tohono O?odham Nation. Instructors will advance their own expertise through in situ practice as well as professional development with linguists and language education experts. To contribute to the greater knowledge base, the OLC will disseminate its findings throughout the tribal college community, the Tohono O?odham community, its related tribes, and other Indigenous communities in Arizona and North America. Through the development of the immersion curriculum and instructional model, a wide range of resources will become available that may be used to inform language continuity efforts across tribal communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objectives are to optimize these models in single and repeated decision contexts, and to integrate these methods in cost-effectiveness analysis. This work is motivated by the need for tractable disease models that incorporate behavior and population heterogeneity, which require data-driven methods to aggregate individuals into interpretable groups while respecting the dynamics of the underlying disease process. Understanding how simulation outcomes can be projected to a lower-dimensional space and bridging the gap between individual and group-level representation in modeling will allow for these methods to better inform policy. Specifically, structural properties, equilibria, and transition dynamics of these models will be studied with the goal of using them to simplify optimization and Markov decision process frameworks on disease dynamics.

To maintain the brain health, stressed or damaged neurons must receive support from surrounding cells to increase their chances of survival. To communicate with each other, both neurons and non-neuronal cells called glia release molecules that communicate their health status and elicit appropriate responses. Remarkably, one of the communication strategies that glia and neurons use involves the transfer of entire cellular organelles called mitochondria whose primary job is to produce energy. While the transfer of healthy, intact mitochondria improves neuronal function, the transfer of faulty mitochondria is toxic. How glia and neurons coordinate requests for and deliveries of mitochondria to ensure brain health is an unanswered question but one of vital importance. This project will elucidate the triggers for mitochondrial transfer, the cellular machinery used in their release, and the uptake mechanisms that integrate mitochondria into recipient cells. In doing so, the research will provide a window into a key process that could in the future be exploited to improve brain function throughout life. To perform aspects of this project, undergraduate students will participate in a unique credit-bearing, team-based research experience focused on neuron-glia communication and using the fruit fly as a model system. Undergraduate students will also participate in an outreach event to local elementary and middle school students. Taken together, the project will reveal new modes of cellular communication that underlie brain health and will provide training opportunities for the future scientific workforce.<br/><br/>This project will establish the mechanisms and regulation of mitochondrial trans-cellular transfer (mitoTCT) in vivo by deploying an innovative combinatorial strategy of genetics, 3D microscopy, and imaging flow cytometry (iFACS) in the Drosophila nervous system. Using dual binary expression systems, neuronal and glial membranes and mitochondria will be labeled with four colors, facilitating unambiguous identification of the sources and directions of mitoTCT. In Aim 1, the project will elucidate key regulators of mitoTCT rate in vivo. This aim will test the hypothesis that nerve injury and/or excess neuronal activity can trigger mitoTCT from glia to neurons. In Aim 2, the project will determine the mechanism(s) by which mitochondria are transferred between glia and neurons. Three proposed modes of transfer (tunneling nanotubes, extracellular vesicles, and release of free mitochondria) will be evaluated by inhibition of each mechanism in a cell type specific manner. In both aims, the health status of mitochondria will be evaluated using genetically encoded redox sensors, which will determine whether the mode of action is leading to rescue or toxicity of recipient cells. This research will advance fundamental knowledge of neuron-glia communication via mitochondria and will illuminate how we might harness mitochondrial transfer for the benefit of neuronal health.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries.<br/><br/>Sulfur aerosols cool the climate. The amount of sulfur aerosol in the Arctic has varied dramatically in the recent past due mostly to sulfur aerosol from coal combustion. Sulfur emissions from coal combustion increased at the onset of the Industrial Revolution and have been decreasing since the 1970s because of the implementation of policies in the US and Europe to reduce air pollution. As human emissions decline, natural sulfur sources, such as from microscopic plants in the ocean, are becoming more important. The ocean biological source of sulfur aerosol may also be changing with a changing Arctic climate, particularly due to the melting of sea ice. This project will measure the two main chemical sources of sulfur aerosol in the Arctic, methane sulfonic acid (MSA) that is only from ocean biology, and sulfate, that originates from ocean biology, volcanoes, and combustion of coal and oil. The project will measure the sulfur isotopic composition of the chemicals in order to distinguish the ocean biological source from the other two sources and determine how large each source is and how fast each is changing. These measurements will provide a way to determine if and how ocean microscopic plants and their sulfur emissions are responding to Arctic climate change. This project will support the training of two graduate students and several undergraduate students. The students and PIs will participate in local outreach events in Seattle, WA and in Brookings, SD. We will work with the School of Ice to produce a new Virtual Field Lab geared towards students from middle school through early college. <br/><br/>Ice-core observations of methane sulfonic acid (MSA) are used as a proxy for past oceanic biogenic productivity because MSA originates solely from the oxidation of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) emitted by ocean phytoplankton. Previous research using Greenland ice cores showed a detectable MSA decline since the 1800s, implying decreasing oceanic biogenic productivity. The use of MSA as a proxy for biogenic productivity relies on the assumption that the branching ratio of production of MSA versus sulfur dioxide (SO2) from DMS oxidation remains constant over time. However, recent examination of MSA and isotopic composition of sulfate in Greenland ice cores over the last 800 years shows that the ratio of MSA-to- biogenic sulfate (MSA/bioSO4) has not remained constant. This project hypothesizes that recent trends in MSA are driven by changes in oxidant abundances (e.g., NOx) that lead to a reduced yield of MSA and increased yield of SO2 during oxidation of DMS. The project will test this hypothesis by measuring ion and MSA concentrations and sulfur isotopes of sulfate in Greenland snow accumulated over the last 30 years. The last 30 years will cover the time when anthropogenic NOx emissions from North America and Europe began to decline (after the mid-1990s). In collaboration with University of St. Andrews in United Kingdom, the project will also measure sulfate isotopes at sub-seasonal resolution over the last 30 years from the proposed shallow ice cores in addition to select, discrete samples from archived ice in the preindustrial. Measuring biogenic sulfate at seasonal resolution since the preindustrial will allow for investigation of changes in the seasonality of biogenic sulfur aerosol in the Arctic resulting from changes in Arctic climate. To assist data interpretation, the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem will be used to quantify the role of different oxidants on DMS oxidation as these oxidants have changed due to anthropogenic emissions. This project has broad implications for the ice-core, climate, and atmospheric chemistry communities because the results will improve our understanding of the impacts of Arctic climate change and anthropogenic emissions on biogenic sulfur aerosols, and thus our understanding of a potentially important climate feedback at high latitudes and future climate projections. This project will support the training of two graduate students and several undergraduate students at the UW and SDSU in ice-core processing, chemical and isotopic analysis, global modeling, and international collaboration. The students and PIs will participate in local outreach events in Seattle, WA and in Brookings, SD.

Discrimination has negative effects on many physical and mental health outcomes, including stress and anxiety. About one third of teen girls are affected by stress and anxiety, and rates among Latina teens in particular have risen over the last few years. However, we know little about how mental health problems like anxiety increase over that time and whether they do so by affecting brain development. Latina girls experience many forms of unfair treatment based on race, family and cultural characteristics, and gender, and are therefore at risk for experiencing stress and anxiety. This study examines whether repeated exposure to unfair treatment during the early teenage years affects how Latina girls learn to distinguish threat from safety, and how parents can play a role in protecting their daughters from the harmful effects of discrimination. The transition between childhood and the early teenage years is an especially important period to study as brain regions related to threat and safety learning are still developing. This study is among the first to include new methods that allow us to compare children?s brain patterns when they view different social and emotional scenes. By using these new methods over time, this research examines how repeated discrimination can affect brain function and lead to anxiety, stress, and feelings of lack of safety. We focus on the unique experiences of Latina girls growing up in Southern California and their parents, who are shaped by their cultural identities and their experiences of discrimination. Doing so leads to a better understanding of community health and brain development, and it informs more effective practices and policies that address the needs of families across the region and the country. <br/><br/>Ethnic-racial discrimination?defined as differential treatment of individuals on the grounds of ethnic or racial group membership, is a salient reality and threat for minoritized youth. The immigration policy contexts and the discourse around it has heightened Latinxs? experiences with ethnic-racial discrimination and an overwhelming majority of Latinx individuals report being subjected to unfair treatment based on their ethnic background. When a child experiences ethnic-racial discrimination, the brain identifies it as a stressor requiring immediate response, but over time, it also becomes a learned process that creates anticipation and heightened threat vigilance towards possible future exposures. For minoritized youth, little is known about how mental health problems like anxiety accumulate over that time and whether they do so by altering trajectories of brain development. A nascent literature has shown that Latina girls, specifically, demonstrate higher rates of untreated anxiety diagnoses relative to other racial and ethnic groups. The goal of this longitudinal study is to examine neurobiological pathways through which cumulative experiences of ethnic-racial discrimination may be associated with integrity of brain networks that detect and regulate threat responses in Latina girls. We use latent change score models to identify perceptual and emotional contributions to threat and safety learning in Mexican-identifying Latina girls during late middle childhood and early adolescence via behavior and multivariate neuroimaging, and examine the independent and interactive influence of ethnic-racial discrimination experiences and parental socialization on neural signatures of heightened threat vigilance and overgeneralization?the inaccurate classification of safe stimuli as threatening. The novel conceptualization of threat and safety learning posits that maintaining flexible distinctions between threat and safety without inappropriately attributing threats to non-harmful stimuli, depends on safety representations not only in previously identified emotion neurocircuitry, but also in higher-order visual areas, affecting how a child perceives her environment. The model also specifies the influence of ethnic-racial discrimination experiences on girls? neural representations of threat and safety. Understanding how such experiences affect representations of threat and safety is a crucial next step for the science of threat learning in childhood, particularly in this underrepresented population.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most cells in a bacterial population die when exposed to a major stress, such as antibiotics, but a small fraction of cells survive for a long time. These survivors, also known as persisters, appear to arise as a result of variability in cell behaviors across the population. The goal of this project is to discover the mechanisms that allow the formation, maintenance, and survival of bacterial persisters and thus to help understand key features of bacterial survival.  The work will involve student researchers, including those from underrepresented groups, who will participate in synthetic biology research experiences as part of the project's educational objectives. In addition, the project will provide professional development workshops for K-12 science teachers to enhance their ability to integrate synthetic biology modules into their classrooms. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this research is to identify the mechanism that enables some bacterial cells to survive after exposure to stress. One hypothesis to be tested is that survival depends on establishment of some type of epigenetically-determined ?memory? of stress that results in higher persister numbers after exposure to the stress. To understand the regulatory processes that enable persisters to survive long-term, lethal stress, the project will use a suite of experimental approaches, such as fluorescence microscopy, microfluidics, and a modified Luria?Delbrck fluctuation test, with synthetic biology and quantitative modeling. In addition, transcriptional analysis, single-cell experiments, and high-throughput techniques will be used to quantify epigenetic patterns in bacteria. The research will produce a quantitative framework for understanding the mechanism responsible for the phenotypic heterogeneity thought to serve as an inherent survival strategy of bacteria. This work will impact fundamental knowledge of how bacteria survive sudden lethal stress and how they deal with harsh environmental fluctuations. The results are expected to offer new insights into the fundamental molecular mechanisms of how cells revive from lethal stress.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Hydrogen is an extremely important chemical feedstock that is used a wide variety of chemical processes. However, by itself it does not react or reacts very slowly. To circumvent this problem a number of metal compounds have been developed that activate hydrogen and greatly speed its rate of reactions. These compounds are called catalysts and almost all are based on expensive, rare metals. This project studies the ability of a less expensive metal, cobalt, to activate hydrogen. As the details of how hydrogen adds to various compounds is difficult to determine, an unusual form of hydrogen known as parahydrogen will be used in this study to increase the sensitivity of measurements up to 200,000 times. In addition, the project aims to improve diversity, equity, and inclusion in the next generation of scientists. Prof. Fout and her students will participate in the 3M Summer Scholars Program, which aims to provide research experiences to undergraduate students from underrepresented groups, the Next Generation Illinois Scientist, which engages elementary students in rural schools, and the Bonding Camp for Girls, which targets 6-8th grade girls.<br/><br/>This project synthesizes cobalt complexes that may serve as parahydrogen-induced polarization (PHIP) catalysts. This requires diamagnetic complexes that remain S=0 throughout the catalytic cycle for both direct and indirect hyperpolarization. To achieve this and to access a Co(I)/Co(III) catalytic cycle, complexes of ligands containing electron-rich moieties and carbenes are prepared. Their activity to catalyze PHIP is evaluated across a range of substrates including olefins, alkynes, and arenes, which feature long-relaxing nuclei in their functional groups.

Change efforts in higher education are challenging, in part because faculty have not received training in organizational change, and in part because effective change needs involvement from diverse stakeholders beyond the professoriate. As a consequence, institutions may continue to use policies and practices that do not effectively address gaps in participation, such as for students of color, women, and people with disabilities. Previous research on organizational change in higher education highlights the importance of social relationships for equipping faculty and other stakeholders to make significant changes to their beliefs and practices. In that vein this project will create a cross-institutional Community of Transformation (CoT) to support university change agents who are working to make changes focused on justice, equity, diversity, and inclusion (JEDI) in their own departments and institutions. This approach is a particularly good match for JEDI-centered organizational change, which requires not only individual adoption of new practices, but also transformation of institutional structures and practices. Through an innovative approach to community building and storycrafting, the project intends to help CoT members make significant JEDI-centered institutional change efforts, learn from one another?s experiences, and learn effective change strategies towards a more just future. This work aims to advance understanding of how CoTs can help JEDI-oriented institutional change efforts thrive.<br/><br/>This project plans to convene a cross-institutional CoT of JEDI change agents in engineering. Through both virtual and in-person events, participants will increase their resilience and skills in enacting change at their institutions, build community and co-support for each other as change agents, and increase their individual and collective agency to create organizational change. This project hopes to provide key insights into improving faculty?s change agency by integrating professional development into the CoT, fostering relationships through which members will learn from each other, and evaluating how a cross-institutional CoT can improve change agents? capacity to improve their own departmental and institutional systems to broaden participation in STEM and advance JEDI outcomes. These key insights will be developed through research on the CoT participants and their efforts to promote change. The research team will use narrative and discourse methods to analyze CoT activities and surveys, interviews, and focus groups with CoT members.

According to the United Nations, food waste is valued at $2.4 trillion/year worldwide with the majority of the expense attributed to transport. Electronic waste is approximately 50 million tons/year with less than 18% being recycled globally. Currently, disposable sensors are used to prevent food waste, yet these sensors contribute to the electronic waste problem. The proposed printed, biodegradable sensors will enhance scientific and technological understanding to move from disposable to on-demand biodegradable sensors. The market opportunity addressed by the proposed technology is over $300 billion in the food supply chain and even larger in the broader perishable markets. The technological shift to printed, biodegradable sensors will provide a competitive advantage compared to other companies that are using disposable or semi-recyclable materials. <br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer (STTR) Phase I project involves the development of carbon-based, printable, electronic materials to produce a biodegradable sensing platform for measuring temperature and humidity. The proliferation of electronic sensors continues to provide access to transformative data, improving health, the environment, and transportation. However, resultant electronic sensor waste is a critical concern that precludes use for certain applications. This project will use graphene for conducting, carbon nanotubes for semiconducting, and crystalline nanocellulose for insulating inks that can be printed into temperature and humidity sensors on a thin film of cellulose (i.e., paper). Technical obstacles include the co-integration of these all-carbon inks, realization of target electrical properties, and yield of functional sensors. The goals of this project include: (1) the formulation of nanomaterial inks for their co-printing onto biodegradable substrates; (2) the development of aerosol jet printing processes; and (3) the demonstration of temperature and humidity sensors from the printed carbon-based nanomaterials. To achieve these goals, innovations in the formulation of these carbon-based inks will be required, along with the design of sensor configurations that yield reliable temperature and humidity measurements. More than a dozen distinct sensor designs will be explored, and iterative tuning of ink and sensor designs will take place.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Upon successful joint determination of an award recommendation, each Agency funds the proportion of the budget that supports scientists at institutions in their respective countries.<br/><br/>Sulfur aerosols cool the climate. The amount of sulfur aerosol in the Arctic has varied dramatically in the recent past due mostly to sulfur aerosol from coal combustion. Sulfur emissions from coal combustion increased at the onset of the Industrial Revolution and have been decreasing since the 1970s because of the implementation of policies in the US and Europe to reduce air pollution. As human emissions decline, natural sulfur sources, such as from microscopic plants in the ocean, are becoming more important. The ocean biological source of sulfur aerosol may also be changing with a changing Arctic climate, particularly due to the melting of sea ice. This project will measure the two main chemical sources of sulfur aerosol in the Arctic, methane sulfonic acid (MSA) that is only from ocean biology, and sulfate, that originates from ocean biology, volcanoes, and combustion of coal and oil. The project will measure the sulfur isotopic composition of the chemicals in order to distinguish the ocean biological source from the other two sources and determine how large each source is and how fast each is changing. These measurements will provide a way to determine if and how ocean microscopic plants and their sulfur emissions are responding to Arctic climate change. This project will support the training of two graduate students and several undergraduate students. The students and PIs will participate in local outreach events in Seattle, WA and in Brookings, SD. We will work with the School of Ice to produce a new Virtual Field Lab geared towards students from middle school through early college. <br/><br/>Ice-core observations of methane sulfonic acid (MSA) are used as a proxy for past oceanic biogenic productivity because MSA originates solely from the oxidation of dimethyl sulfide (DMS) emitted by ocean phytoplankton. Previous research using Greenland ice cores showed a detectable MSA decline since the 1800s, implying decreasing oceanic biogenic productivity. The use of MSA as a proxy for biogenic productivity relies on the assumption that the branching ratio of production of MSA versus sulfur dioxide (SO2) from DMS oxidation remains constant over time. However, recent examination of MSA and isotopic composition of sulfate in Greenland ice cores over the last 800 years shows that the ratio of MSA-to- biogenic sulfate (MSA/bioSO4) has not remained constant. This project hypothesizes that recent trends in MSA are driven by changes in oxidant abundances (e.g., NOx) that lead to a reduced yield of MSA and increased yield of SO2 during oxidation of DMS. The project will test this hypothesis by measuring ion and MSA concentrations and sulfur isotopes of sulfate in Greenland snow accumulated over the last 30 years. The last 30 years will cover the time when anthropogenic NOx emissions from North America and Europe began to decline (after the mid-1990s). In collaboration with University of St. Andrews in United Kingdom, the project will also measure sulfate isotopes at sub-seasonal resolution over the last 30 years from the proposed shallow ice cores in addition to select, discrete samples from archived ice in the preindustrial. Measuring biogenic sulfate at seasonal resolution since the preindustrial will allow for investigation of changes in the seasonality of biogenic sulfur aerosol in the Arctic resulting from changes in Arctic climate. To assist data interpretation, the global chemical transport model GEOS-Chem will be used to quantify the role of different oxidants on DMS oxidation as these oxidants have changed due to anthropogenic emissions. This project has broad implications for the ice-core, climate, and atmospheric chemistry communities because the results will improve our understanding of the impacts of Arctic climate change and anthropogenic emissions on biogenic sulfur aerosols, and thus our understanding of a potentially important climate feedback at high latitudes and future climate projections. This project will support the training of two graduate students and several undergraduate students at the UW and SDSU in ice-core processing, chemical and isotopic analysis, global modeling, and international collaboration. The students and PIs will participate in local outreach events in Seattle, WA and in Brookings, SD.

For the correct development and function of human bodies, and those of any organism, specific proteins need to be produced in specific tissues or organs, at specific times. It is also essential that proteins be produced at their correct levels to achieve their normal cellular functions. A number of genes called ?dosage sensitive genes? produce proteins that are exquisitely sensitive to changes in level, meaning that too much or too little of these proteins is detrimental to the cells, and thus to the living organism. Changes in the level of these proteins, which may be caused by having too few or too many copies of the genes that produce them, often result in human disease. This project studies a mechanism for ensuring that genes are not produced at overly high levels. The researchers study this type of regulation in a model organism that enables a quantitative and detailed examination of development and of protein production under different conditions. They use a microscopic nematode, C. elegans, in which they can modify genes and measure the output during development. Studying such mechanisms can inform our understanding of why some gene mutations cause disease, and could ultimately teach us how to manipulate gene dosage for therapeutic purposes.<br/> <br/>A significant fraction of genes in a genome are dosage sensitive, such that copy number variation (loss or gain of even a single genomic copy) often results in disease. Identifying the regulators that enable precise gene expression levels is critical to fully understand gene regulation and to reveal modifiers of disease relevant genes. MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are quantitative repressors of target mRNAs at the post-transcriptional level and it has been proposed that dosage sensitive genes rely on miRNA-mediated regulation. The researchers have established an experimental paradigm to test this in the context of a key developmental process that relies on precise gene dosage: animal morphogenesis. miR-100 is the most deeply conserved animal miRNA, present across all Eumetazoa. Despite its conservation, the molecular, cellular and organismal roles of miR-100 are practically unknown. The researchers propose to use C. elegans to study the function of this ancient animal miRNA and gain insight into the regulation of dosage sensitive genes in development. They have evidence that ECM components are conserved targets of miR-100 in worms, fish, mice and humans, suggesting that this miRNA may be involved in cellular signaling and adhesion in C. elegans, and likely other animals. Using genetic approaches, the researchers will reveal the role of this ancient miRNA in C. elegans, provide insight into its function in other animals based on shared targets, define the role of a dosage dependent regulator of morphogenesis, and gain new understanding of the contribution of miRNAs as regulators of dosage sensitive genes.<br/><br/>This award is co-funded by the Developmental Systems Program in the Integrative Organismal Systems Division and the Genetic Mechanisms Program in the Molecular and Cellular Biosciences Division of the Directorate for Biological Sciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Whereas objects are composed of tangible substances such as wood, glass or metal, our perceptions of them are based on patterns of light. Thus, an adequate theory of perception must be able to explain how patterns of light can uniquely specify the 3D structure of the visual environment. This research project will study the visual perception of object shape, with a focus on understanding how the human visual system processes and interprets information about the three-dimensional properties of objects. A better understanding of 3D vision could provide many practical applications. For example, it could lead to dramatic improvements in the design of visually guided robots or autonomous vehicles. It could also be important for building prosthetic devices for the blind to avoid potential obstacles during locomotion or to detect the presence of slippery surfaces that create a danger of falling.  <br/><br/>The computational analysis of 3D shape from shading has been studied for over 50 years but despite the broad interdisciplinary scope it has had relatively minimal success. One possible reason is that researchers have typically simplified the problem by making unrealistic assumptions about how light behaves in the natural environment. This makes it easier to derive mathematical solutions, but severely limits the generality of the resulting analyses. In the present work, the investigators will include many of the optical effects that have typically been ignored in this domain, including cast shadows, surface inter-reflections, anisotropic reflections, light transmission, and multiple patterns of illumination. They will also perform detailed measurements of the luminance field in each condition to discover properties that are relatively invariant over changes in scene parameters. The work will focus primarily on qualitative surface features, such as bumps, dimples, ridges, valleys, and saddles, and how they correspond to similar qualitative patterns of image shading. Numerous psychophysical experiments will be conducted to document 1) how observers? judgments of 3D surface structure are influenced by the pattern of image shading; 2) the stability of these judgments over changes in surface materials and patterns of illumination; and 3) how smooth variations of light intensity on the eye provide information about 3D shape, even when all other aspects of shading have been removed.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The effective adoption and use of PLA in the US education system can promote educational attainment, STEM workforce development, and national development by supporting lower-resourced educational institutions and members of underserved communities. Prior research has focused on enhancing the technical implementation of these AI-based systems, but studies of why deployments of existing technologies have failed identify issues that are not technical but social, psychological, or cultural in nature. For example, educators? trust in and effective use of PLA are instrumental for realizing their potential benefits, motivating this work to study how changes in the framing, level of transparency, and training can improve educators? use of PLA. The project will involve 3,600 US educators across several large-scale studies and advance an understanding of what influences educators? trust and effective use of PLA, as well as AI-based education technology more broadly. These insights will guide the development of an evidence-based curriculum about PLA for educators to foster awareness, trust, and effective use. The PLA training materials will be made available online and via posts on social media channels. This project develops concrete and scalable interventions to help design technologies that affect the academic progress of learners of all ages.<br/><br/>Building on the Technology Acceptance Model and Academic Resistance Models, the project will investigate how educators respond to procedural justice framings and algorithmic transparency for AI-based education technology, especially during expectancy violation and high levels of uncertainty.

How different presentations of PLA influence educators? usage intentions will be investigated by using an online noise audit, which quantifies how much the same information about students leads educators to the same conclusions about how to intervene. The cumulative insights of the project will be applied in a field experiment on a university campus to examine if evidence-based improvements to an existing at-risk identification process can encourage faculty to reach out to students and better support them.

A common teaching challenge is how best to support students when they are stuck on a mathematics problem in a homework assignment. When the goal is to support productive struggle and not just provide the correct answer, it is not always clear how much support should be provided. An existing free web-based platform allows teachers and researchers to author questions and solution step supports, and it makes student action data available to instructors and researchers. Previous research results on the use of this platform to support student learning and the use of formative feedback in instruction in secondary school classrooms was promising. Given the potential of the platform as a useful pedagogical tool in those settings, this project aims to adapt the platform for use at the undergraduate level, where research indicates the need for such supports in introductory level mathematics and statistics courses. Understanding how the technological supports provided to college students as they complete mathematics problems impacts student learning and confidence will provide important insights for the design and implementation of educational materials broadly.<br/><br/>By adapting prior studies, this project seeks to determine whether the use of an existing online platform for formative assessment of student work at the college level leads to similar gains in mathematics learning and analogous changes in pedagogical practices as has been reported at the middle school and high school levels. Over 100 randomized control trials have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of supports provided through the ASSISTments platform, but these have primarily occurred at levels of schooling prior to the undergraduate years. This project aims to determine whether the use of the platform at the college level leads to similar gains in learning and analogous changes in pedagogical practices. This will be accomplished by replicating studies at the college level which have been shown in the literature to be ?Best So Far? supports ? those supports which have significantly impacted student learning the most. To accomplish this, the project has four main aims. First is to support scalability by adding a feature to the platform which allows for the uploading of questions and solutions from the learning management system Canvas, thus creating a database of at least 500 problems aligned with college algebra, precalculus, calculus, and statistics curricula. A second aim is to design questions and feedback to improve student understanding and help them complete math homework problems, by creating 16 classroom-ready assignments on common topics in college algebra. Third is to use the platform in college mathematics courses and measure its impact on student learning, and persistence in STEM majors, thus generating large and rich datasets containing student actions within the platform. The fourth and final project aim is to track system usage by instructors during the semester, i.e., while problems are assigned and immediately after the due date, and also the persistence of system usage from semester-to-semester. Project results will be disseminated through the Open Science Framework and the platform?s website.

The technology can provide significant value to hospital systems, physicians, and patients alike by reducing healthcare costs associated with opioid-related adverse events and preventing opioid addiction by eliminating their use after surgery. In 2021, there was a historic rise in opioid overdose deaths to over 80,000 individuals. Opioid use disorder-related Medicaid spending has more than tripled in the last 15 years and the opioid crisis has been estimated to cost $72.4 billion during that time period. Preventing opioid addiction by reducing exposure of opioids to surgical patients can have a significant impact on reducing financial costs to society as a whole. In 2017, there were an estimated 48 million major surgical procedures requiring postoperative pain management in the United States, representing a $17 billion total addressable US market.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project seeks to perform Food and Drug Administration (FDA) required manufacturing characterization and animal studies to demonstrate the novel, injectable, long-acting local anesthetic technology is safe for initial human use. The solution involves a novel oleogel-based injectable drug delivery system that can provide local sustained delivery of lipophilic small molecule drugs. In Phase I, the team optimized the technology for rheological properties, drug release kinetics, and stability to create an injectable gel that provides 96 hours of sustained bupivacaine delivery.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Given that climate change will produce more severe natural disasters that will disproportionately affect vulnerable populations, including groups typically underrepresented in geoscience and engineering fields, it is critical to bring together a diverse group of researchers capable of tackling this growing set of environmental challenges. This travel award develops a Mentoring Institute for Sediment Transport researchers (MIST) to connect science and engineering leaders (mentors) with early career professionals (mentees). Travel funding will support 25 early-career mentees to attend the 2023 ASCE EWRI World Environmental and Water Resources Congress or the 2023 AGU Fall Meeting. This support will enable mentees to attend an annual mentoring meeting during one of these conferences, and it will kick off future MIST activities.<br/><br/>MIST aims to be an inclusive institute consisting of racial, gender, and ethnic diversity among mentors and mentees. MIST is a virtual network that connects mentors ? accomplished professionals in academia, governmental agencies, and industries ? with mentees in early career stages, including tenure or non-tenure track faculty, researchers in non-profit institutions or federal laboratories, postdoctoral scholars, and students, with a focus on individuals from underrepresented groups. MIST will collaborate with other mentoring networks including the Student Mentoring Program in the AGU Earth and Planetary Surface Processes section and Mentoring365 (chronus.com). Mentees will be recruited prior to the proposed conferences, targeting underrepresented professionals and students from Minority Serving Institutions, and advertising via mechanisms such as the Women Advancing River Research Seminar Series. MIST will also create a list of qualified mentors who have technical knowledge and enthusiasm to guide mentees. Prior to the conference, MIST will match mentees with mentors. At the EWRI and AGU Fall meetings, mentees will participate in technical sessions highlighting state-of-the-art research in sediment transport and will also participate in an in-person annual mentoring meeting. MIST aims to help the mentees to become future leaders in science and engineering. Through these activities, the project expects to 1) publish a special issue in a reputable journal of selected mentee and mentor papers from the conferences, 2) foster collaborations across two professional societies, and 3) create an inclusive, diverse mentoring network for early career professionals.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Growing and erupting teeth are among the most transformative drivers of changes in facial appearance, promoting bone formation and influencing overall jaw growth. Prior research has focused on the eruption of ?baby teeth?, or deciduous teeth, and subsequent permanent teeth. However, the period near or at birth, when many teeth are not yet fully developed, has rarely been studied. This study investigates the role(s) of teeth in facial development during early critical periods, and results inform a better understanding regarding how different parts of anatomy can influence the appearance of others, as well as the whole organism. The project generates 3D models, a website and other resources for K-12 students and provides training and professional development to one postdoctoral scholar and multiple graduate and undergraduate students. <br/><br/>This study investigates the underpinnings of functional matrix theory, which posits that bones that border soft tissue structures and other organs such as teeth, directly cause transformations of bone morphology. The principal investigators use the two sides of lower jaw to study cellular and tissue-level event in tooth and jaw formation, which are then mirrored on three-dimensional reconstructions of the opposite side of the jaw. The three-dimensional reconstructions are accomplished using micro computed tomographic (CT) scanning to detect bone, following by a second scan after soaking half of the jaw in iodine, after which unmineralized tooth germs are easily detectable using CT. Amira software are used to generate three-dimensional views that denote critical cellular and tissue-level mechanisms (i.e., cell signals for bone deposition and resorption, and bone cell maturation). CT will also be used for morphometric analyses. Ultimately, by investigating how developing teeth compete for space within a growing face, results are relevant for interpreting variation in modern and past anatomy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project puts forth a highly collaborative, synergistic research approach entailing a multi-disciplinary study in structural biology, protein biochemistry, enzymology, chemistry, and physics. Mentorship is key to the success of this project with multi-layered training opportunities, built on the principles of ?team science?, available to postdoctoral trainees as well as graduate and undergraduate students.

This effort will be aimed at biology-focused students who will be engaged in research that is related to non-trivial quantum effects in biology.<br/><br/><br/>Proteins, and possibly other macromolecules, have evolved in a manner to initiate, sustain, enhance, and/or communicate quantum phenomena, including tunneling and spin coherence. A full mechanistic understanding into how nature accomplishes these interactions, and how it leads to a biological outcome, resides in the successful interplay between the scaffold of the protein and active site quantum behavior. Investigations within this project will draw on cutting edge advances in experimentation, including time-resolved and temperature-dependent structural studies coupled with functional assays, and theory to create a complementary and holistic data-driven understanding of the relationship between energy flow in a protein structure and either thermal or light initiation of quantum behavior. The research focuses on two disparate protein systems with distinct folds and complementary quantum effects ? hydrogen tunneling in lipoxygenase catalysis and spin coherence in cryptochromes associated with magnetoreception and circadian clocks. The underlying theme of the research will be the identification and mapping of anisotropic protein networks that control vibrational motions and/or conformational changes linked to a productive output. The principles that emerge from this research go beyond the scope of hydrogen tunneling and spin coherence, by expanding our knowledge base of function-coupled thermal and light activated protein networks. The resulting insights could potentially be leveraged to encode new functionalities into (re)designed proteins.

However, these models take a lot of time to process a video, and leveraging them for analyzing videos involves a non-trivial programming effort. There is a growing interest in the database community in designing video database management systems to tackle these efficiency and usability challenges. This project seeks to develop novel techniques for speeding up queries over large video datasets like retrieving the gameplays that lead to a touchdown in a football game. It will reduce the human labor cost of analyzing videos in a wide range of applications, ranging from urban planning to astrophysics. A close collaboration with domain scientists and industry practitioners will be pursued to help transfer the ideas to scientific and enterprise applications. The proposed work includes an integrated education plan related to video database systems in the database courses offered at Georgia Tech.<br/><br/>This project tackles the outstanding problem of accelerating video analytics from a new standpoint. Recently proposed video database systems have two key limitations. First, their optimizers are not tailored for offline, exploratory video analytics, wasting system resources at scale and raising the cost of query processing. Second, they support a limited range of queries related to detecting objects and are unable to support richer queries like localizing actions or re-identifying objects. The goal of this proposal is to address these limitations of state-of-the-art video database systems. This work will generate knowledge of how to construct accuracy-driven optimization for complex vision pipelines. It will address the paucity of large datasets due to privacy concerns, by developing techniques for generating synthetic datasets. The innovation is not in creating new vision models, but in new database-style techniques to better optimize exploratory query workloads and to broaden the range of queries supported by video database systems. Overall, this work innovates upon the field of database systems to start a new line of research on optimizing exploratory video analytics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This alignment is critical because a wide range of professionals in sectors including government, business, engineering, and journalism are adopting data visualizations for data analysis connected to social issues. However, their data analysis and visualization work is often not well-informed by empirical research. Designers are often self-taught, while practitioner-focused design guidelines are often not substantiated by empirical evidence of their effectiveness and come from different and sometimes inconsistent sources. Often, those sources are not researchers; although there have been some efforts to develop research-backed guidelines and visualization tools, on balance, the research community has not made a concerted effort to make its results usable for practitioners. This, in turn, leads to less effective visualizations that can harm both decision-making and public understanding. This project aims to bridge this knowledge gap by building a comprehensive platform for improving access to and learning about effective visualization design and promoting informed, evidence-based design practice.<br/><br/>The project is organized around three research thrusts. The first thrust will explore the knowledge gap by examining the current state of design practice and empirical research. The project will survey the landscape of existing guidelines, collect a dataset of more and less accurate and accessible visualization examples, and analyze overlaps and discrepancies of these guidelines and visualizations with what is known from empirical research studies. This analysis of artifacts will be complemented by interviews with practitioners and researchers that focus on the practices and challenges they have around knowledge transfer. The second thrust will consolidate the data collection and analysis to develop an ontological framework for scaffolding visualization design knowledge, along with a knowledge-based platform where people can browse, discuss, and maintain an evolving list of guidelines, empirical evidence, and relevant visualization examples. The final thrust will go beyond knowledge management to production and dissemination. The project will employ a citizen science approach to investigate the unexplored design space in real-world visualizations that involve design elements absent in typical empirical studies. The platform will also provide a programming interface to enable novel external applications such as intelligent design assistants and educational assessment tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As a result, the control of flexible, dexterous, goal-directed movements is one of the most important functions of the nervous system. Motor circuits in the vertebrate brain are arranged hierarchically. Low-level circuits in the brainstem and spinal cord ? such as the central pattern generators that control breathing and locomotion ? can autonomously produce basic motor patterns. High-level motor circuits allow animals to learn and adapt movements, detect and correct errors, predict the cost and benefits of actions, and assemble movements into complex sequences to attain behavioral goals over long time scales. High-level circuits do not generally control movements directly, but, instead, engage and modify the basic motor programs produced by low-level circuits. Low-level circuits in turn integrate an array of inputs from many high-level areas to synthesize the motor commands that drive motor neurons and muscles. Little is currently known about how a multitude of high-level motor centers together control low-level circuits in a coordinated fashion, despite the centrality of this process to all flexible behavior.<br/><br/>     The overarching goal of this project is to identify how high-level regions of the mouse motor system turn on, turn off, and modify the motor patterns produced by low-level circuits. Critically, tackling this problem will differentiate between two competing models of hierarchical control that may be utilized in the mammalian brain. In the Cooperative model, there exists a ?division of labor? between high-level motor centers with different circuits responsible for different computational processes ? any or all of which may be invoked simultaneously according to behavioral demands. Alternatively, the Parallel model predicts that many high-level brain regions are equally capable of commanding movements in their entirety, with different regions subsuming control in the behavioral context for which they are specialized.  This project leverages a cutting-edge experimental toolkit in mice for manipulating neural activity and tracking the signals communicated between them with cell-type specificity. This project focuses on control of a well-defined central pattern generator responsible for controlling tongue movements in mice to leverage a novel paradigm in which mice perform the same tongue movements in contexts associated with different high-level control processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The mainstream models of energy demand are reductionist, dividing demand into separate categories such as residential, commercial, and transportation, and analyzing each separately. This collaborative research will develop a holistic model of energy demand, one that considers how consumer actions affect multiple sectors at the same time, including residences, vehicles, commercial buildings, server/data networks, and the production of purchased goods. The model will include consumer ownership and use of energy- consuming technologies such as vehicles or home furnaces, and accounts for how people use time and spend money. The new model will be constructed for the U.S. by integrating government micro-data on consumer behavior (American Time Use Survey, Residential Energy Consumption Survey, National Household Travel Survey, Consumer Expenditure Survey), using modern data analysis methods to integrate them. The integrated dataset will provide information about energy device ownership and use, internet use, time spent in commercial buildings, and expenditures on goods. A set of models will map these consumer attributes to energy use and carbon emissions. For commercial buildings, a regression model will be built that links the area of different building types with consumers? and employees? use of them. An Economic Input Output Life Cycle Assessment (EIOLCA) will estimate the energy use and emissions from consumer expenditures. The holistic model will help understanding of the broader effects of demand interventions. For example, how are the carbon benefits of electric vehicles affected by induced changes in consumer purchases and activity choices? The model will help assess the effect of behavioral changes not typically considered in policy (e.g. encouraging telework), and thus could broaden the scope of policy options considered. <br/><br/>The model advances the state of energy demand modeling on a number of fronts. First, the model combines data on personal expenditures, time, and technology use to provide a household-level estimate of life cycle carbon emissions, accounting for energy use in residences, commercial buildings, servers/networks, transportation, and manufacturing of goods. Part of the contribution is in integrating existing models into a larger holistic framework. Missing modeling elements will be developed, in particular linking consumers? use of commercial buildings to energy demand, and attributing use of information technology to energy demand in data networks and servers. In methods, the research develops a new approach for assessing how change in time use of a given activity (e.g. shift from driving to biking) leads to changes in other activities as well as the overall energy use from the primary shift in activity. The research involves merging multiple data sources on consumers via representative populations, and this dataset will be made publicly available. Outreach activities include a workshop with energy efficiency modelers and policy advocates, development of an energy demand game, and a summer camp for high school students from underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

From drills (small) to escalators (large), most high-torque products require gear systems to amplify the torque given the maximum capacity because the size of the product cannot be increased or decreased indefinitely. However, it is known that gear systems reduce efficiency by as much as 80%. Also, due to irregular loading utility, it experiences vibration and counter torque affecting the motor's life. Moreover, mobile systems requiring huge input power mostly rely on fossil fuels that pollute the environment. The proposed technology is anticipated to affect the electric motor market, especially high torque motors, and it will provide opportunities to form new markets that have not been explored due to the limited efficiency of motors.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a sustainable torque generator which is developed by utilizing multiple Control Moment Gyroscopes that can generate huge gyroscopic torque. However, since the torque generated by the Control Moment Gyroscopes is uncoordinated, singular, and non-permanent, it is difficult to make the Control Moment Gyroscopes a motor system that can generate torque in a constant direction. Nevertheless, by optimizing the configuration of multiple Control Moment Gyroscopes with this mechanism and developing the proprietary control algorithm, this solution can produce large torque without gear systems with higher efficiency than existing systems.

This GRC will be the 13th in a series of Interior of the Earth conferences that focus on the structure, dynamics, and evolution of the Earth?s interior. This meeting will bring together scientists from a wide range of subdisciplines within Earth sciences, including geochemistry, geodynamics, mineral physics, rock deformation, seismology, and petrology. We have requested funds to help support travel costs of early-career conference participants (graduate students, postdoctoral scientists, and early-career faculty). The GRC will take place at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts from June 18-23, 2023 and will be held in conjunction with a Gordon Research Seminar (GRS) from June 17-18 at the same venue. The GRS is aimed at an audience of graduate students and postdoctoral scholars and provides a unique environment for these early-career scientists to present and exchange state of the art ideas and results. The travel support provided by this award will help to fund conference attendance for early-career scientists to attend the GRS and/or the GRC.<br/><br/>The theme of the 2023 GRC is ?Material Properties of the Mantle and Core and their Constraints, Causes and Consequences for Earth Evolution.? This theme will engage scientists who work on a range of depths within the Earth, from the lithospheric mantle to the core, and will enable discussion on the structure and dynamics of the Earth?s interior through the prism of the properties of the materials that make up its mantle and core. Understanding these properties ? for example, rheology, composition, elasticity, and thermal behavior ? is key for understanding the inner workings of our planet. The conference will encompass keynote talks that emphasize new (unpublished results) as well as poster presentations, which will provide the opportunity for participants (particularly early-career scientists) to present their work in poster format. Networking by younger scientists will be greatly facilitated by the preceding GRS, which has the theme ?Evolution of the Interior Structure of Earth from the Magma Ocean Stage to the Present.? In constructing the program and in advertising for the meeting, we have been conscious of diversity along a number of dimensions. We have placed particular emphasis on giving speaking opportunities to early-career scientists; having a significant proportion of early-career researchers and first-time attendees as Keynote Speakers and Discussion Leaders will encourage greater participation across the global community of deep Earth researchers. The preceding GRS meeting will include a mentorship session that focuses on communication and careers in Earth Science.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The recording occurs remotely and autonomously, where the scientist has no access to the data until the instrument is recovered during a follow-up station visit. Often, a scientist has to wait for more than a year to analyze the collected data. For earthquake and tsunami monitoring purposes, this is much too long to conduct useful, and often critical, short-fuse research. This project, will engineer an acoustic modem gateway between the OBS and a wave glider on the sea surface to ultimately transmit data from the seafloor all the way to the desktop of a data analyst in near-real time. The OBS will transmit low-rate data (1 sample per second) to shore continuously. A novel engineering aspect of this project will be the possibility of two-way traffic, i.e. a data analyst can request a snipped of high-rate data (50 samples per second) immediately after an interesting event. A new-generation high-quality seismic sensor will be used on the newly developed shielded OBS package that will allow the recording of seismic signals from the tidal band (several hours) to high frequencies limited only by the sampling rate. The shielding of the seismic sensor will significantly reduce ambient noise contamination caused by deep-ocean currents. Ultimately, the new technology will provide a stepping stone to a long-duration (several years) multi-node mini array of OBS's on the seafloor, serviced by several concurrent wave gliders that visit stations in turn to transmit data back to shore.<br/> <br/>This project will focus on the design, construction and testing of a Telemetered Seafloor Seismic Observatory (TeSSO) comprising a very-broadband ocean bottom seismometer and a differential pressure gauge. The SSO will be equipped with an acoustic micromodem and is linked through a wave glider that facilitates a Surface Communications Gateway (SCG) with shore-side mission control via acoustic and satellite services. The wave glider will cruise on the surface and relay buffered 1 sps data from the SSO via satellite to shore-side mission control. A new two-way data traffic capability will allow shore-side researchers to order specific higher sample-rate data snippets (50 sps) in case an interesting earthquake or other seismogenic event occurs. This project draws on past expertise gathered from the 2013 ADDOSS project that provided wave-glider-based near-real time access in a one-way fashion, where the ocean bottom seismometer sent data autonomously. Since then, significant improvements in technology (e.g. 3rd generation wave glider, low-power broadband seismometers, and ?smart? data loggers) have occurred. The realization of TeSSO relies critically on engineering design and development to assemble off-the-shelf components. Two short sea trials will help optimize the instrument package and the SCG. On a third trial, the wave glider will transit between two close-by SSOs and transmit data on an alternating schedule. This will lay the ground work for a system of multiple SSOs that are served in near-real time by a fleet of wave gliders. TeSSO will be able to address some, but not all, items on a growing wish list compiled by data users from both the global seismic networks but also an increasing number of passive seismic deployments in the oceans<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Such a transformative approach can provide detailed renderings of the brain at the cellular level to reveal the organizing principle and the mechanism of neural connectivities. Furthermore, these new insights could accelerate the treatment development for neurodegenerative diseases and inspire novel AI algorithms. However, the connectomics image data of a mere one-millimeter cube brain region is on the petabyte scale, where existing computational pipelines produce too many errors for domain experts to correct in neuron reconstruction. What is missing is not just a better reconstruction method but a human-centric approach to automate the labor-intensive workflows before and after the reconstruction, e.g., data annotation to train the model and error correction to refine the results. This project will build a scalable human-centric computational pipeline with novel algorithms to mimic human cognition to reduce human effort in the pipeline significantly. If successful, the developed workflows will be deployed to expedite the BRAIN Initiative?s ambitious whole-mouse brain reconstruction project to revolutionize the understanding of the brain.<br/> <br/>This project will focus on accelerating the labor-intensive workflows of data annotation, proofreading, and transfer learning in the machine learning pipeline.

(1) This project will distill the unlabeled data to learn to group images by appearance to assist domain experts in effectively discovering sub-volumes for annotation and propagating sparse labels to dense reconstruction. (2) This project will build automatic agents to learn from domain experts? proofreading strategies to detect and correct the automatic reconstruction results.

However, the vast majority of computer chip manufacturing currently takes place outside of the United States, which presents significant economic and cyber security concerns. Moreover, advancements in new materials are driving innovations in computing technologies, which will  drive advancements in next-generation computing devices.  The Materials Science and Engineering Department at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) will host a Research Experiences for Undergraduates (REU) site titled ?Materials for Future Computing? that supports the development of an engaged and qualified workforce for the semiconductor industry.  Working with local colleges and minority serving institutions (MSIs), the site welcomes students from diverse backgrounds who have not historically had as many opportunities to conduct scientific research. Participants take a hands-on approach to learning about the structure and properties of electronic materials as well as the fundamentals of nanofabrication processes relevant to the computer chip industry.  The experience incorporates field trips to local companies and direct use of the state-of-the-art CMU Materials Characterization and Nanofabrication facilities.  Students attend regular seminars to learn about best practices in conducting research and are paired with a research mentor to work on an individual research project, which is communicated in a final closing ceremony.  The program perpetually evaluates the student experience including outcomes beyond the 10-week period so that the long-term goals of the program are tracked.<br/><br/>Technical Summary:<br/><br/>The Research Experience for Undergraduates (REU) site ? Materials for Future Computing - exposes students to state of the art facilities for nanofabrication and advanced structural characterization of materials.  As highlighted in the SRC 2020 Decadal Plan for Semiconductors, energy consumed from computation could soon be comparable to global energy production. Thus, the discovery, fabrication, and characterization of new materials is paramount to improving the energy-efficiency of modern computers. The Materials for Future Computing experience leverages existing CMU facilities including the Carnegie Mellon nanofabrication facility (CMNF) and Materials Characterization Facility (MCF).  Students are paired with a faculty research mentor where they will conduct research on an individual project related to electronic materials.  In addition to the individual research projects, students are offered a range of universal experiences including weekly tutorials related to best practices in research, weekly workshops held within MCF and CMNF including three off campus field trips, regular collegial meetings, and roundtable discussions with the PIs. A primary objective of this proposal is to expand opportunities to students who have historically not had equitable opportunities to pursue scientific research.  The proposed REU site takes steps to recruit underrepresented minorities (URMs) and promote gender diversity through outreach to minority serving institutions (MSIs) and existing engineering professional societies.  The Principal Investigators work with local colleges in the Greater Pittsburgh Area that have limited research opportunities and do not offer graduate school programs including 2-year community colleges.  The long-term impact of this site is to broaden the participation of students in engineering and to strengthen research and development in the semiconductor industry in the United States.<br/><br/>This Site is supported in part by funds provided to the National Science Foundation by the Semiconductor Research Corporation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, those interactions could have unintended and potentially negative effects on people if the AI system expresses cultural values or beliefs they disagree with. Indeed, when humans interact with each other, cultural differences can lead to ?culture clash,?  which may trigger misunderstandings, mistrust, rejection, or declines in well-being. Thus, understanding to what extent culture clash may happen in human-AI interaction, and how people react to AI systems that express varied values, is an important question in making AI-based conversational systems that are acceptable, useful, and inclusive of people from different backgrounds. <br/><br/>This project aims to investigate the ways values and beliefs embodied within conversational AI systems vary and whether diverging values between humans and AI can have effects similar to culture clash between humans. The team of researchers will develop: (1) methods for measuring cultural values in a variety of language models that form the basis for conversational AI systems; (2) insights into how prominent language models compare to human values across the world and across groups in the United States; and (3) empirical knowledge of the effects of mismatching values between humans and conversational AIs on a person's own values, trust, and subjective well-being, and the implications of these for larger society. The team will also release datasets for other researchers and deploy an online platform to allow the public to explore the values expressed by conversational AI systems, share their own experiences with culture clash in AI-based systems, and think about potential culture clashes and their consequences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

At the same time, coastal communities are facing increasing threats from climate related sea level rise (SLR).  Thus, there is a rapidly growing need for both global and local SLR projections with uncertainties that reflect our scientific knowledge. This CAREER award will meet the challenge by using the wealth of information contained in four decades of SLR science to improve the scientific community?s understanding of sources of uncertainty within SLR projections. The project will analyze previous SLR science to improve the scientific community?s understanding of sources of uncertainty within SLR projections at global and local scales. The project will support development of a publicly accessible interactive website (a ?SLR Dashboard?) that will serve as a central hub for comprehensive SLR projection databases, allowing users immediate access to key SLR projection data, visualizations, and statistical tools. By improving our understanding of the uncertainty that currently exists within projections of future SLR, this work will enhance our ability to develop adaptation and resiliency strategies in coastal communities around the globe. Undergraduate students at Rowan University will be engaged in development and analysis of the databases and will share their work during events with public audiences. The project includes plans to develop children?s book with literary and educational experts that will teach broad audiences about rising sea levels in an engaging and accessible format.<br/><br/>Four decades and ~10 cm of global mean SLR since the first global sea level projections were made, projections of future SLR remain deeply uncertain. Although a major source of uncertainty relates to the amount and timing of melt from the Antarctic Ice Sheet, additional uncertainty arises from problem formulation?choices in methodology used to project future SLR, and emissions scenarios considered. While the science behind SLR projections is constantly improving, differences amongst the large numbers of available SLR projections can make it difficult for decision makers to interpret the science and decide which projections they should use. By analyzing existing projections to better understand sources of structural uncertainty, we can reduce the impact of problem formulation upon SLR projection uncertainty over various time scales, improving the practical application of SLR projections in a wide variety of settings. The scientific goals of this project are to 1) further develop publicly-available databases that describe both local and global SLR projections, 2) use machine learning and statistical analyses to quantify how uncertainty manifests and evolves in SLR projections at various spatial and temporal scales, and 3) evaluate the sensitivity of various SLR projection methodologies to climate drivers to improve our understanding of the uncertainty within current projections of SLR. The project will also support the training and education of undergraduates in data analysis and sea level rise policy issues. The project will support development of a children's book about SLR.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The REU's significance is its development and sustained support of the next generation of physicists. It is structured to address the leaky STEM pipeline for underrepresented minorities and women by providing (i) high-quality research experiences in an inclusive climate, (ii) hard and soft skills that support success in STEM fields, and (iii) embedding participants in a supportive network of REU alumni, mentors, and supporters that extends well beyond the summer. A central component of the Georgia Tech Physics REU program is its partnership with the local HBCUs, Clark Atlanta University, Morehouse College, and Spelman College, which prioritizes four out of twelve REU positions for their students. Students are exposed to a broad range of physics through weekly discussions of their progress (Monday Mentoring Meetups), a Frontiers in Physics seminar series, and a trip to a National Laboratory. Participants will gain timely technical skills in a three-day hands-on Computational Physics workshop. Beyond the summer, long-term mentoring and facilitated peer networking will improve outcomes.  The combined impact of a high-quality, immersive summer research experience in a supportive and inclusive environment and the possibility of joining a diverse lifelong community of like-minded physicists in the Georgia Tech REU alum network will ultimately improve the number, the success, and the well-being of underrepresented minorities, women, and all REU participants who pursue higher education in physics or another STEM field. Hence, these activities serve national interest by advancing the field of physics, supporting education and diversity, and fostering a new generation of knowledgeable, resilient, and well-prepared scientists so that they may pursue their highest goals.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>The Georgia Tech Physics REU site has a longstanding focus on broadening participation in physics. The aims of this NSF REU program are to: (i) provide high-quality inclusive research experiences, in combination with a series of professional and scientific development activities, (ii) motivate and prepare resilient undergraduates to pursue, and succeed in, graduate study, (iii) assemble a cadre of participants that reflects the diversity of the U.S., (iv) attract students from institutions that have limited research activities, (v) continue engagement of the participants beyond the summer and throughout their careers, and (vi) foster collaborations between Georgia Tech and the Atlanta University Center Consortium (AUCC: Morehouse College, Spelman College, Clark Atlanta) to enhance inclusive educational and research opportunities for students in the AUCC. Each participant will work with a faculty member who has an active research group in an area of interest to the student. Available physics research projects will range from  quantum materials to the physics of living systems to astrophysics. The program will benefit from shared activities with established REU programs (~5) in other disciplines within the College of Sciences. At the end of the program, students share their research in poster and oral presentations at a College-wide REU Research Symposium.  Students will be encouraged to present at external conferences, and AUCC students will have the option to continue research at Georgia Tech beyond the summer. Long-term mentoring of REU alums will strengthen their resilience and support their journeys beyond college. Networking between the REU alum cohorts will be facilitated via the 'Alum in the Hot Seat' series, a newsletter, and the GT REU Physics Linked In Group.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent controversies, however, have brought unprecedented challenges to the Court?s legitimacy. With trust in the Court at historic lows and recent research suggesting the Court?s legitimacy may be more fragile than previously thought, commentators and scholars alike are raising increasingly dire warnings that the Court?s decisions in highly salient cases have the potential to erode its foundation of public support. Largely missing from this growing discussion of the Court?s public standing, however, is the perspective of the country?s racial and ethnic minorities. As a result, it is unclear whether minority citizens continue to hold the Court in high regard and what impact, if any, the Court?s decisions have on that support. <br/><br/>To explore the dynamics of support for the Supreme Court among minority citizens, the project will employ a combination of survey research and elite interviews. A nationally-representative survey of Americans will provide insights into the state of public support for the Supreme Court, with an oversampling of African-American, Hispanic, and Native American respondents allowing for detailed analyses of the Court?s standing among minority citizens. To understand the effect of a significant Court decision on minority citizens? views of the Court, the project will further focus on the attitudes of Native Americans. To do so, the project will leverage the Court?s anticipated 2023 ruling in a high-profile case in two ways. First, Native American survey respondents will be re-contacted after the Court?s decision with a second wave of the survey, thereby providing an opportunity to evaluate the impact of the ruling on the Court?s support among those most directly affected by the decision. Second, interviews with leaders of Native American tribes both before and after the Court?s decision will grant insights into the ruling?s impact on the views of minority communities? political leaders. The findings from this research will yield important insights into the Supreme Court?s relationship with minorities at this critical juncture in American politics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, images from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs), satellites, and reconnaissance cameras lack stereo information causing 3D reconstruction and depth estimation to fail.  Turbulence caused by air and water also causes light rays to deflect from their original path and introduces noticeable motion artifacts like blurriness and distortion.  This project develops a generalizable motion field estimator using neural networks coupled with specific hardware settings to enhance computer vision tasks in long-range imaging. Successful development of such a motion field estimator can enable applications of computer vision systems at long distances and/or under turbulent environments including UAV navigation, object tracking and detection, and long-range monitoring.

Of all ancient taxa regarded as living relics, cycads are particularly notable because recent evidence suggests extant cycads may not be relics at all, but instead evolved during the Neogene period (~20My ago). This time period was characterized by declining temperatures, atmospheric CO2 concentrations, and the expansion of arid regions. This research asks whether Neogene climate change drove the diversification of cycads as they evolved their anatomy and physiology in response to the new conditions. This integrative approach that spans from cells to whole plants will provide a novel perspective on cycad evolution and test whether this ancient lineage experienced concurrent and parallel evolution on multiple continents hundreds of millions of years after the origin of cycads. The proposed work is especially critical because cycads are among the most endangered plant groups on Earth, with ~70% of species threatened with extinction, primarily due to habitat destruction and poaching. Perhaps no other lineage of plants disappearing at such an alarming rate can provide as unique an opportunity to examine one of the earliest experiments of seed plant evolution, and our results will directly inform conservation practices. This project will provide research experiences for graduate students and undergraduates at University of Wisconsin-Madison and Florida International University, one of the nation's largest Hispanic Serving Institutions, as well as research-driven field courses for undergraduates.   <br/><br/>This research will uncover the ecological and evolutionary processes that have generated the extant diversity of one of the oldest and most unusual groups of seed plants, the cycads. To determine whether Neogene diversification of cycads was enabled by adaptive trait evolution, the project will: (A) characterize the diversity of cycad anatomical traits (e.g. anatomical traits of stomata, bundle sheath extensions, transfusion tissue, and xylem) and test their impacts on gas exchange and hydraulic responses to abiotic conditions (e.g. light, CO2, VPD, drought), (B) test whether these anatomical and physiological traits are linked to species? distributions in climate space, and (C) determine whether the timing and order of trait evolution corresponded to Neogene climate change. By leveraging the unusual anatomical trait combinations exhibited by cycads, this research may have far reaching impacts in plant physiology, ecology, and evolution by: (A) revealing the significance of anatomical traits with poorly known function(s) that are also found in other plant groups (e.g., bundle sheath extensions, transfusion tissue), (B) characterizing the function of trait combinations that are exceptionally rare among extant plants but commonly found in extinct taxa (e.g., tracheids and homogeneous pits) thus allowing new insight into the function of extinct lineages and better contextualizing the sequence of physiological trait evolution in vascular plants, and (C) testing long-standing hypotheses about the repeatability and predictability of evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Advances in understanding could lead to the prediction of new states of matter with novel properties as well as new materials with potentially useful applications.<br/><br/>A particular state of strongly interacting electrons is the ?pair-density wave superconductor?, which is a quantum mechanical and superconducting analogue of molecules found in liquid crystal displays. It shares properties of both a solid and a liquid. The PI will further investigate whether such phases can explain the peculiar properties of materials known as high temperature superconductors. At sufficiently low temperatures, electrons in superconductors enter a cooperative quantum mechanical state that enables them to conduct electricity without any resistance. High temperature superconductors are interesting because they exhibit superconductivity at much higher temperatures than many other known classes of superconductors. The proposed pair-density wave state of matter may help explain how this is possible and how materials that exhibit superconductivity at room temperatures might be discovered. This could lead to virtually lossless transmission of electric power and other energy-related applications. The other focus of the research concerns understanding experiments seeking new states of matter. Of particular interest are those called topological states which are predicted to have unusual properties that would enable computation based on the laws of quantum mechanics. Such a computer could solve certain problems much faster than any currently existing computer.<br/><br/>The research engages cutting edge problems in the physics of materials and provides opportunities to train the next generation of theoretical scientists at an exciting frontier.

The objective is to understand condensed-matter systems involving many strongly coupled degrees of freedom whose behavior is governed by strong effects of quantum mechanics. The electrons in such strongly correlated systems organize spontaneously in electronic liquid crystal phases and topological phases.  An unavoidable feature of these phases is that they naturally describe intertwined orders. They are closely related to mechanisms of high temperature superconductivity, a fundamental problem in physics which already has had a strong impact in technology. Topological phases are quantum fluid states of matter that do not have an order parameter, and therefore do not break any symmetry, but possess a kind of hidden quantum order in which the ground state degeneracy is determined by the topology of the space in which they exist.  The quantum states of a topological fluid are strongly entangled, a property that can be used to devise a topological quantum computer, a frontier problem in physics and mathematics having great potential impact on technology. Related topics that will be investigated include the relation between electronic liquid crystal phases and high temperature superconductivity, quantum coherence and interference phenomena in quantum Hall systems, quantum  entanglement and topological quantum computing.<br/><br/>The PI will use the methods and ideas of quantum field theory, because they are natural approaches to attack problems involving the  statistical and quantum physics of strongly interacting  systems. Such an approach enables the project to exploit the continuing and mutually enriching cross-fertilization of ideas between condensed matter systems, high energy physics, and mathematics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Similarly, differences in the genomes of bacteria and viruses help to determine their specific characteristics such as, for example, whether they are harmful to humans or animals. These genetic differences are important to understand and to take into account when studying the biology of an organism because they play such an important role in how even individual cells in the organism function. Advances in genome sequencing technology have generated huge catalogs of such differences in many organisms, including humans. These rich repositories of genomic information cannot be fully integrated and analyzed due to a lack of effective computational methods, and existing methods suffer from computational inefficiencies and lapses of accuracy when drawing conclusions from collections of genomic differences. This project will develop new computational methods to increase accuracy and decrease computational resource requirements for storing, comparing, and evaluating catalogs of genomic differences. It will result in new scientific software that will better organize catalogs of differences to make computational analyses more tractable. It will also result in software that more accurately measures the diversity of a population of individuals and software that supports making better comparisons between populations. The project will validate these methods by subtyping cancer tumors, assessing the diversity of cells in various types of tumors, and by comparing populations of bacteria found in different environments. The project will result in faster, more accurate software for the analysis of many genomic differences that will advance our understanding of how genomic variants affect human health and biological processes. To better explain the innovations developed during this project and the importance of studying genomic differences, the project will also produce a series of educational videos that will help other people understand the main ideas behind the techniques developed in this project.<br/><br/>Genome graphs have emerged as an important data structure in the analysis of collections of genomic variants. These are graphs in which nodes (or edges) are labeled with genomic sequences (strings) and paths in the graph represent substrings that are present in the population that the graph represents. They can be used as representations of a ?reference? genome for a population of organisms. Genome graphs have been used to reduce bias in the reference genome, form more inclusive reference genomes, and to reduce space and time requirements to perform genomic sequence analyses. For this reason, many tools are being adapted to use genome graphs as references in lieu of traditional linear (single sequence) references. While genome graphs have consistently proved useful in these areas, the algorithms for a number of problems associated with them suffer from poor computational scaling and lack of formalization. The project will develop and validate algorithms for several central genome graph problems, specifically to (goal 1) construct genome graphs, to (goal 2) compare genome graphs, and to (goal 3) assess the complexity of genome graphs. The framework that the project will use to solve these problems is innovative in that it involves exploiting the under-explored connection between graph flow decompositions and genome graphs. This approach reveals natural relationships between genome graphs and the population of strings they represent. This global view of the expressive power of a genome graph is central to the formulations that the project will explore. The problems that the project will tackle bridge graph theory and genomics, leading to greater interactions and connections between those fields. Our algorithms will allow genome graphs to more accurately reflect desired populations, will allow information from multiple genomes to be better integrated, and will advance the informatics tools needed to exploit large collections of genomic variants. The project will apply and evaluate these algorithms to (1) improve sequence alignment for mapping populations of genomes, (2) improve clustering of cancer tumor sequences and metagenomic samples, and (3) better model the progression of heterogeneity in metastatic cancer samples. The developed algorithms will be implemented in an open-source library to encourage their use in other systems. Finally, the project will create open-source, free instructional videos to introduce concepts such as pan-genomics, genome graphs, and the developed algorithms to a wider audience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This alignment is critical because a wide range of professionals in sectors including government, business, engineering, and journalism are adopting data visualizations for data analysis connected to social issues. However, their data analysis and visualization work is often not well-informed by empirical research. Designers are often self-taught, while practitioner-focused design guidelines are often not substantiated by empirical evidence of their effectiveness and come from different and sometimes inconsistent sources. Often, those sources are not researchers; although there have been some efforts to develop research-backed guidelines and visualization tools, on balance, the research community has not made a concerted effort to make its results usable for practitioners. This, in turn, leads to less effective visualizations that can harm both decision-making and public understanding. This project aims to bridge this knowledge gap by building a comprehensive platform for improving access to and learning about effective visualization design and promoting informed, evidence-based design practice.<br/><br/>The project is organized around three research thrusts. The first thrust will explore the knowledge gap by examining the current state of design practice and empirical research. The project will survey the landscape of existing guidelines, collect a dataset of more and less accurate and accessible visualization examples, and analyze overlaps and discrepancies of these guidelines and visualizations with what is known from empirical research studies. This analysis of artifacts will be complemented by interviews with practitioners and researchers that focus on the practices and challenges they have around knowledge transfer. The second thrust will consolidate the data collection and analysis to develop an ontological framework for scaffolding visualization design knowledge, along with a knowledge-based platform where people can browse, discuss, and maintain an evolving list of guidelines, empirical evidence, and relevant visualization examples. The final thrust will go beyond knowledge management to production and dissemination. The project will employ a citizen science approach to investigate the unexplored design space in real-world visualizations that involve design elements absent in typical empirical studies. The platform will also provide a programming interface to enable novel external applications such as intelligent design assistants and educational assessment tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A common teaching challenge is how best to support students when they are stuck on a mathematics problem in a homework assignment. When the goal is to support productive struggle and not just provide the correct answer, it is not always clear how much support should be provided. An existing free web-based platform allows teachers and researchers to author questions and solution step supports, and it makes student action data available to instructors and researchers. Previous research results on the use of this platform to support student learning and the use of formative feedback in instruction in secondary school classrooms was promising. Given the potential of the platform as a useful pedagogical tool in those settings, this project aims to adapt the platform for use at the undergraduate level, where research indicates the need for such supports in introductory level mathematics and statistics courses. Understanding how the technological supports provided to college students as they complete mathematics problems impacts student learning and confidence will provide important insights for the design and implementation of educational materials broadly.<br/><br/>By adapting prior studies, this project seeks to determine whether the use of an existing online platform for formative assessment of student work at the college level leads to similar gains in mathematics learning and analogous changes in pedagogical practices as has been reported at the middle school and high school levels. Over 100 randomized control trials have been conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of supports provided through the ASSISTments platform, but these have primarily occurred at levels of schooling prior to the undergraduate years. This project aims to determine whether the use of the platform at the college level leads to similar gains in learning and analogous changes in pedagogical practices. This will be accomplished by replicating studies at the college level which have been shown in the literature to be ?Best So Far? supports ? those supports which have significantly impacted student learning the most. To accomplish this, the project has four main aims. First is to support scalability by adding a feature to the platform which allows for the uploading of questions and solutions from the learning management system Canvas, thus creating a database of at least 500 problems aligned with college algebra, precalculus, calculus, and statistics curricula. A second aim is to design questions and feedback to improve student understanding and help them complete math homework problems, by creating 16 classroom-ready assignments on common topics in college algebra. Third is to use the platform in college mathematics courses and measure its impact on student learning, and persistence in STEM majors, thus generating large and rich datasets containing student actions within the platform. The fourth and final project aim is to track system usage by instructors during the semester, i.e., while problems are assigned and immediately after the due date, and also the persistence of system usage from semester-to-semester. Project results will be disseminated through the Open Science Framework and the platform?s website. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In contrast to traditional<br/>chemotherapy, PDT/PTT is highly selective because light can be delivered specifically at the tumor and<br/>thus confines the toxicity to the tumor. The widespread use of PDT for cancer treatment has been limited,<br/>in part, by the drawbacks associated with the photosensitizing molecules approved for this therapy. They<br/>tend to require shorter wavelengths of light that do not penetrate tissue as well as near-infrared light, cannot<br/>treat oxygen-deprived tumors, cause prolonged cutaneous sensitivity to sunlight, and are poorly soluble in<br/>aqueous solutions. PDT could become more widely available as an adjuvant cancer therapy if better<br/>photosensitizers can be developed. This project will address some of these challenges with novel<br/>photosensitizers based on the transition metal iridium (Ir). These new molecules will be activatable with<br/>near-infrared light and able to generate ROS even when tumors oxygenation is low. The proposed Ir<br/>molecules are unique in that they are equipped with special functional groups designed to shift the activation<br/>wavelength of the molecules into the near-infrared while maintaining good ROS generation efficiency.<br/>Meanwhile, these near-infrared absorbing Ir molecules will also produce heat that will further maintain<br/>phototoxic effects in the absence of oxygen through PTT. The combination of PDT with PTT could<br/>significantly enhance the cancer treatment efficiency, especially toward oxygen-deficient tumors. In<br/>addition, folic acid will be attached to the Ir molecules for added discrimination for certain types of tumors,<br/>such as triple negative breast cancer.<br/><br/>The proposed research and educational and outreach activities will boost biomaterials research at North<br/>Dakota State University (NDSU) and the University of Texas at Arlington (UTA), and will have broader<br/>impacts on the biomedical field in general. The scientific community will benefit from a deeper<br/>understanding of heavy transition-metal complexes and their application as near-infrared photosensitizers<br/>in the field of phototherapy. The interdisciplinary nature of this project will provide the involved graduate<br/>and undergraduate students with training opportunities in synthesis, spectroscopy, and photobiology, which<br/>will prepare these students for the future biomaterials workforce. The proposed outreach activities<br/>involve/expose tribal college students, high school students, and underrepresented African<br/>American/Hispanic students in/to modern biomaterial research and technology transfer, which will increase<br/>the diversity of the future workforce in biomaterials field. The two female PIs can serve as role models for<br/>female students and encourage more female students to pursue scientific careers.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>This project aims to develop dual-action novel Ir(III) complex photosensitizers (PSs) for combined<br/>photodynamic therapy (PDT) and photothermal therapy (PTT) of cancers. The proposed PSs are bis-terpyridine<br/>Ir(III) complexes equipped with a chalcogenophene-substituted diketopyrrolopyrrole (DPP) unit<br/>and folic acid. These PSs will be NIR (700-850 nm) activatable, exhibit cancer-specific targeting, and<br/>generate efficient ROS and/or hyperthermia for treating hypoxic solid tumors such as triple negative breast<br/>cancer (TNBC). The PIs posit that attaching a chalcogenophene-substituted DPP motif to one of the<br/>terpyridine ligands will shift the absorption of the PSs to the NIR regions while maintaining the long-lived<br/>DPP localized 3pi,pi* state as the lowest-energy triplet excited state. It is anticipated that the long-lived triplet<br/>state will provide sufficient time for bimolecular interactions with oxygen for efficient ROS generation even<br/>under hypoxia. In addition, the strong NIR absorbing PSs are expected to generate hyperthermia effects<br/>for PTT as an alternate relaxation pathway due to the much lower-energy triplet states associated with NIR<br/>PSs. The combination of PDT with PTT could significantly enhance the cancer treatment efficiency,<br/>especially toward hypoxic tumors. Folic acid will be introduced to the other terpyridine ligand for specific<br/>targeting of cancers with overexpressed folic acid receptors. The photophysics of these new and improved<br/>Ir(III) PSs will be systematically investigated according to their absorption and emission profiles and triplet<br/>excited state lifetimes. The effectiveness of the proposed PSs as in vitro PDT/PTT agents and the<br/>photosensitization mechanism(s) and subcellular targets will be explored using the TNBC MDA-MB-231<br/>cell line. The proposal addresses the major challenges to current PS development, i.e. high dark toxicity,<br/>inability to be activated by tissue penetrating NIR light, low ROS generation efficiency in hypoxic solid<br/>tumors, low cancer selectivity, and water insolubility. The success of this study could benefit the biomedical<br/>field of phototherapy by providing a deeper understanding of heavy transition-metal complexes and their<br/>application as NIR PSs, which would eventually enable PDT/PTT to be applied to deep-seated, high-volume<br/>tumors, leading to more effective cancer therapies for some hard-to-treat solid tumors, such as TNBC.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

More specifically, the project team will help address the STEM teacher shortage in rural South Dakota by exploring factors that inspire students to pursue STEM teaching. At the same time the project also aims to strengthen partnerships with high-need rural and tribal schools within the region. The project will survey and interview teachers and administrators at rural schools and districts, as well as recent alumni, K-12 and university students, and personnel from other Noyce-funded STEM educator preparation programs. Results will bring light upon the needs of potential partner schools in recruiting, retaining and supporting STEM educators, particularly early career teachers with backgrounds similar to the students they serve. Findings will also inform the structure of secondary STEM teacher preparation programs and will provide direction in creating a recruitment and support plan geared toward students from rural and low-income backgrounds.<br/><br/>This project at Black Hills State University includes partnerships with the Center for the Advancement of Mathematics and Science Education (CAMSE), the Center for American Indian Studies (CAIS), and up to 10 regional school districts. Project activities include conducting two needs assessments. One will center on high needs-schools and districts with a focus on rural and tribal schools within a 150-mile radius of BHSU. The goal is to establish formal partnerships that address the identified needs. The other needs assessment will center on high school students, university students, and teacher education graduates, and will focus on the needs of rural and tribal communities. The outcomes of these assessments are intended to support the development of a recruitment plan for a future Track 1 Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program proposal. The project also aims to review the structure of STEM majors at BHSU and evaluate the feasibility of restructuring the academic programs to align with other teacher preparation programs, particularly those in rural areas. Results may inform recruitment, retention, and early career support strategies of STEM teacher preparation programs at other small, rural, primarily undergraduate institutions. This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts.

Transitions between mutualism and parasitism have evolved often. However, little is known about the biology of organisms that have undergone these transitions. Understanding this important evolutionary transition has important ramifications for medicine, agriculture, and epidemiology. This project supports research by four master?s students studying the biology of one group of insects (leafflower moths) that have evolved from mutualistic to parasitic relationships with their host plants. Student projects will study the genetics of these moths in Texas and the southeastern United States. They will also explore the diversity of bacteria associated with these moths? caterpillars, and the biology of moths in this genus that were just discovered in Puerto Rico. Students will also train with external collaborators, and travel to a scientific conference to present their findings. The University of Texas Permian Basin (UTPB) is a Hispanic-Serving Institution and the largest university in the Permian Basin of West Texas, with a student population that is majority-first generation college students.

Finally, the work will provide data on the way in which third party associates (larval microbiomes) vary with the mutualism-parasitism transition and shifts among host plant lineages. Results from this research will be readily interpreted in the context of previous work on the biology of the mutualistic congeners of these parasites in Asia and the Pacific.

The project will draw information from drifting floats and computer simulations to track waters from the Icelandic Coastal Current. Computer simulations will also analyze the sensitivity of buoyant transport to shifts in river discharge variations associated with 21st and 22nd century warming. Simulations will track buoyant waters with artificial tracers that will provide information on the time it takes for these waters to flush out of the region. Simulations will leverage hydrographic observations by Iceland?s Marine & Freshwater Research Institute, and satellite measurements that distinguish the edge of the buoyant current.  As broader impacts, the project will support one postdoctoral researcher and one graduate student. It will also incorporate findings into undergraduate and graduate classes, and post YouTube videos on river influences in the marine environment. The PI will participate in educational events at a public school system with a diverse student population.<br/><br/>This study will examine freshwater export from Icelandic rivers to the North Atlantic Ocean. Iceland is the study region as it has an assortment of shelf conditions (e.g., wide and narrow shelf widths, high and low river input regions, extensive canyons and no canyons, headlands of different radii of curvature, upwelling and downwelling conditions) that allow exploration of a wide range of shelf-ocean interactions. In addition, the system is a gateway to the Arctic with a complex hydrological cycle (having river systems fed by glacial melt and precipitation) that are being impacted by climate change. Several specific objectives pertain to the offshore transport of coastal buoyant water in the presence of complex coastal topography, wind, and open ocean forcing. The research will address these objectives with doubly-nested realistic ROMS simulations with an outer resolution of 4km and an inner resolution of 0.5 km, and with drifter releases in the context of the buoyancy-driven Icelandic Coastal Current. Numerical simulations will be validated with data from Iceland?s Marine & Freshwater Research Institute and the drifter releases.

However, exactly how plant diversity arose from the combination of mountain uplift, the development of new habitats, and species interactions is unclear. This research aims to understand how these factors led to plant diversity in cloud forests and high-elevation grasslands. The researchers will develop new software to compare plant genomes to understand the ancestry of four groups of flowering plants in the Andes. The project will also result in new mathematical models to test the importance of different factors in shaping diversity in these plant groups. These new methods will have broad application to studies of biodiversity in the Andes and beyond. Additionally, this project aims to train the next generation of scientists in the study of biodiversity through a variety of interrelated activities, including: (1) a course for undergraduates to do guided genomic research; (2) collaborative training for students; and (3) computational training for diverse students.<br/><br/>The project will first establish well-supported phylogenetic hypotheses for each of the four focal clades of Andean plants using low-coverage and targeted genome sequence data. Samples will be collected from Colombia as well as museums. This work highlights the importance of natural history collections in cutting-edge biological research, and new fieldwork will add to those collections. A component of the research will be to develop new approaches to address complexities common in plant genomes, including polyploidy and paralogy, that can affect estimates of evolutionary relationships. These methods will be made available through open-source software such that other researchers can easily estimate phylogenies and examine support for phylogenetic hypotheses using sequence data. Second, the project will develop new models that jointly infer the roles of dispersal and trait evolution in species diversification. These methods will be applied to phylogenomic, morphological, and distribution data collected for this project. These methods will also be made publicly available for widespread use. Finally, by comparing the roles of biogeographic and ecological processes in generating diversity in these clades, the research will address the generality or idiosyncrasy of the processes facilitating rapid radiation in tropical Andean plants.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, over the course of millions of years, select lineages of fishes have crossed the  boundary between marine and freshwaters, established permanent residence, and diversified in the newly colonized environment. A subset of the fish groups then underwent remarkable evolutionary expansion upon colonizing freshwaters, diversifying into an array of different species that play different ecological roles. Australia and New Guinea are unique because their freshwater fish communities are primarily comprised of lineages derived from marine ancestors, and at least seven such lineages underwent spectacular diversification. This project will explore how varying rates of evolution, ages of different fish groups, and the interactions among fish communities have influenced the evolutionary outcomes of colonizing freshwaters in the Australia-New Guinea region. The study also aims to determine the genetic mechanisms underlying adaptation to freshwater environments, findings of particular relevance to a changing planet. The project will train undergraduate and graduate students in modern biodiversity science, and through student exchanges, provide benefits to US and New Guinean students. High school teachers will be trained to read, interpret, and teach the evolutionary Tree of Life, skills that can be incorporated into K-12 curriculum. Finally, an electronic guide the fishes of New Guinea will be developed and made freely available. <br/><br/>While much progress has been achieved in identifying the drivers of adaptive radiation in relation to colonization of islands by terrestrial animals (e.g., finches, anoles) or lakes by fishes (e.g., cichlids, sticklebacks), transitions into rivers by marine groups have rarely been examined in this context. The proposed project will take advantage of a unique 'natural experiment'??the depauperate primary freshwater fish community in rivers of Australia and New Guinea??to examine the extent to which marine-to-freshwater transitions resulted in adaptive radiations. More specifically, it aims to identify the factors that promoted or constrained lineage, phenotypic, and genomic evolution of marine-derived freshwater groups in the region. The project will integrate genomic, morphological, paleontological, and ecological data from more than 400 fish species representing 16 families in the Australia and New Guinea region to study diversification patterns associated not only with transitions across the marine-freshwater boundary but also along the benthic-pelagic axis. Phylogenomic analyses in combination with phylogenetic comparative methods will be used to study how the chronological sequence of habitat transitions influenced the outcome of lineage diversification and morphological evolution of freshwater radiations. Comparative genomic approaches based on whole genomes will be used to identify loci related to functional adaptations, including signatures of molecular adaptation and convergence, as well as gene family expansions and contractions. Ultimately this project will provide an evolutionary framework to help understand the factors regulating adaptive radiations across environmental gradients.

As sprays are encountered in numerous natural and engineered scenarios involving liquids, their study is important both at a fundamental and applied level. The aim of this project is to develop an experimental platform to explore the role of micropatterned boundaries on the evolution and subsequent breakup of liquid sheet edges. Project results can be used to validate numerical and computational studies of breakup mechanisms. The project, part of the Engineering Research Initiation program, will take place at a primarily undergraduate serving institution of higher education and will give student groups from existing project-based courses the opportunity to develop experimental equipment. Additional student participants will benefit from existing campus programs - one of which is directly tied to university efforts at improving and promoting diversity, equity, and inclusivity in STEM ? providing excellent mentoring and professional development opportunities. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to improve experiments to explore the breakup of liquid sheet edges, fundamental to the formation of droplets by sprays, by investigating the influence of micro-scale patterns on the physical boundaries from which the edges are created once liquid sheets are detached. Previous experiments have used rapid heating of metal wire frames to form the edges of liquid films (soap films). The key questions this project proposes to answer are: (1) Instead of using an unadulterated metallic wire to form the initial edge of a liquid sheet for detachment experiments that use rapid boiling to free the edge, can an edge, or boundary, be created with micro-scale patterns to induce disturbances of a known spatial wavelength onto that liquid film edge? (2) If this is possible, what is the nature of the influence of the modulated disturbance on the evolution of the edge?

Mormyrids are a group of over 200 species known for unique traits, including the ability to generate electric signals and the complete absence of flagella in their sperm. The research team recently discovered a partial deletion mutation in a gene that is essential for sperm flagella formation in mormyrids. The project uses gene editing in zebrafish to test whether this single mutation results in the loss of flagella in fishes, and investigates a newly discovered unique morphological trait of mormyrid eggs that may facilitate fertilization when flagella are absent. In addition, several hypotheses about the evolutionary causes of flagella loss in mormyrid sperm will be tested, providing a link between genetic mutations and the evolutionary forces that operate on them. By revealing effects of the mutation on other functional systems dependent upon cilia and flagella, the research may also provide novel insight into human ciliary disease. The project promotes teaching and training by integrating research outcomes into an undergraduate course and through training of a post-doctoral fellow, two graduate students, and several undergraduate student researchers.<br/><br/>The objective of the project is to understand the genetic basis of the loss of flagella in sperm in weakly electric mormyrid fishes, a group of over 200 species known for their numerous derived and novel traits, including the evolution of electrogenesis, electroreception, and extreme encephalization. Interestingly, mormyrids are also the only known vertebrate group to completely lack flagella on their sperm. The research focuses on a highly conserved cilia- and flagella-related protein which plays a crucial role in the formation of sperm flagella and ciliary motility; the gene coding for this protein was recently discovered to have a partial deletion within mormyrids. By using CRISPR/Cas9 gene editing to create mutant zebrafish, the investigators will determine whether this deletion leads to flagellar loss, and what pleiotropic consequences of this mutation result for other ciliated cell types. Additionally, the project will examine sperm-egg interaction in mormyrids, test for evidence of sperm competition, and assess the hypothesis that sperm flagellar loss is driven by selection for energetically efficient testes. The study of mormyrids will provide important insights into the evolution of a unique vertebrate mating system and may also have implications for novel therapeutic interventions for primary ciliary dyskinesia in humans. In addition to educational and training impacts, the project also supports continuation of the EFISH Genomics Portal, a resource for the scientific community studying electric fishes.<br/><br/>This project was co-funded by the BIO-IOS Physiological Mechanisms and Biomechanics Program and the Animal Developmental Mechanisms Program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, very little is known about the transport of mass momentum, heat and associated drag occurring in flows over ground-elevated surface roughness, named e-type roughness. This is critical for numerous engineering applications and of particular interest in solar photovoltaics. This is because convective cooling plays a critical role in controlling solar photovoltaics efficiency, and accounting for the right wind loads is important when designing new installations. The goal of this project is to investigate how different spatial arrangements of the ground-elevated surface roughness control mixing processes and flow structures in the flow. The ultimate question is whether it is possible to manipulate the mixing and drag characteristics in the flow through the proposed arrangements. Results of this project will enhance solar photovoltaics energy harvesting efficiency, thereby directly impacting the solar energy community and helping transition the U.S. into meeting the goal of becoming carbon neutral in a shorter period of time. The project will also encompass significant educational activities, including summer exchange programs for the graduate students, training on how to effectively communicate science content to the general public, and the development of training videos for the solar energy community.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop new understanding about mixing processes that result from the perturbations induced by ground-elevated (e-type) surface roughness and thermal spanwise heterogeneities. The scientific outcomes of this research will include enhancement of the current knowledge related to mixing processes over complex surfaces taking place when both turbulence and thermal forcings are simultaneously present and development of new scaling relations that include the effect of heated and non-heated photovoltaics-inspired ground-elevated surface roughness elements. The objectives of this project will be fulfilled through a synergistic effort including innovative high-resolution large-eddy simulations (LES) and particle image velocimetry in scaled wind tunnel experiments. The wind tunnel experiments will provide instantaneous velocity fields which will be used to compute the budget of vorticity, thus quantifying the momentum exchanges. The LES will also provide the instantaneous temperature fields which will also contribute to the balance, accounting for thermal effects. This analysis will facilitate understanding the factors contributing to the formation of secondary circulations in elevated roughness elements. In addition to the new understanding that will be developed in fluid mechanics, the proposed research will also yield critical information to guide the design of future solar photovoltaic farms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A full mechanistic understanding into how nature accomplishes these interactions, and how it leads to a biological outcome, resides in the successful interplay between the scaffold of the protein and active site quantum behavior. Investigations within this project will draw on cutting edge advances in experimentation, including time-resolved and temperature-dependent structural studies coupled with functional assays, and theory to create a complementary and holistic data-driven understanding of the relationship between energy flow in a protein structure and either thermal or light initiation of quantum behavior. The research focuses on two disparate protein systems with distinct folds and complementary quantum effects ? hydrogen tunneling in lipoxygenase catalysis and spin coherence in cryptochromes associated with magnetoreception and circadian clocks. The underlying theme of the research will be the identification and mapping of anisotropic protein networks that control vibrational motions and/or conformational changes linked to a productive output. The principles that emerge from this research go beyond the scope of hydrogen tunneling and spin coherence, by expanding our knowledge base of function-coupled thermal and light activated protein networks.

The project will refine a genetics education curriculum, called Humane Genome Literacy (HGL), in order to reduce belief in genetic essentialism. This research will provide curriculum writers and educators with knowledge about how to design a humane genetics education to maximize reductions in students? genetic essentialist beliefs and minimize the threat of backfiring (unintentionally increasing belief in essentialism). The research findings will demonstrate how to support teachers who wish to reduce beliefs in genetic essentialism by teaching students about the complexity of human genetics research using the HGL learning materials.  Project research findings, learning materials, and professional development institutes will be made available to educators and researchers across the country who desire to teach genetics to reduce racial prejudice. <br/><br/>To prepare for the research, the project will revise and augment the project?s existing HGL curriculum and professional development institutes.  In year one, the project will develop new versions of the HGL interventions. Using these materials, the project will train teachers to implement new versions of the HGL interventions in their classrooms. Researchers will video and audio record a sample of teachers and students as they learn. These data will be analyzed qualitatively to: (1) examine how the conceptual change of genetic essentialism was promoted or impeded by interactions between teachers, students, and the materials; and (2) identify and corroborate general factors undergirding the backfiring effect.  Knowledge constructed through these studies will be used to revise the HGL interventions and PDIs.  In year three, using the revised versions of the HGL intervention, the project will conduct a cluster randomized trial (CRT). The CRT will compare the HGL interventions to a well-defined ?business as usual? genetics curriculum, using a statistically powerful and geographically diverse sample (N = 135 teachers, N = 16,200 students, from 33 states). Using data from the CRT, the project will identify classrooms where the interventions reduced essentialism, had no effect on it, and where it backfired. Then, the project will use stimulated recall methods to interview the teachers and students in those classrooms to make sense of factors that contributed to these outcomes. The project will use this information to develop the final version of the HGL interventions and PDI materials.

Responding to such issues involves interactions among diverse community stakeholders, including healthcare providers, research institutes, government agencies, nonprofit organizations, and community residents. However, these stakeholders are typically isolated or inefficiently organized, which leads to unbalanced community coordination and inefficient decision-making in substance use responses. To address these challenges and gaps, this Smart and Connected Communities Panning Grant (SCC-PG) will go beyond the current practices to promote substance use disorder treatment by connecting multiple community stakeholders via innovative community-based coordination mechanisms and connecting the residents from rural areas with urban medical resources via novel mobility technologies. Situated at the heart of Appalachia, Knox County and the surrounding communities are selected as an ideal natural testbed to demonstrate how the proposed delivery mechanism and framework can address infrastructure challenges, hurdle interaction and communication barriers, and help improve access to necessary medications among individuals with substance use disorder.<br/><br/>The goal of this SCC-PG project is to create connected systems and intelligent technologies to advance the understanding of interactions and perceptions among people who use drugs, healthcare providers, and government agencies; and build upon the in-depth understanding to engage communities to enable novel practices to treat substance use disorder and reduce illicit drug use. Specifically, the project aims to 1) develop community perception models that reveal how patients? choices and concerns and public?s acceptance on truck- and drone-enabled delivery mechanisms influence the service patterns and operations, 2) create new truck- and drone-assisted healthcare delivery frameworks and operations through integration of these quantified perception models and operation constraints from healthcare providers and regulatory agencies, and 3) establish novel community engagement models that channel information in a connected way, through which patients, healthcare providers, scientists, engineers, government officials, and volunteers are all involved in a timely fashion to foster informed and all-inclusive decisions and practices to achieve connected interventions and treatment.

This doctoral dissertation research examines how the gut microbiome is likely an important component of physiological adaption in wild, non-human primates. Because the gut microbiome is tied to many different aspects of health throughout the life course, results from this study can provide valuable insights into how gut microbes facilitate host stress and immune response to help wild primates cope with changes in their environment. In addition, this project explores the impact of the gut microbiome on primate fitness and evolution. While conducting the dissertation project, the doctoral student participates in scientific outreach for K-12 students and gives talks about the importance of gut microbes for human and animal health. The doctoral student also mentors undergraduate students in fieldwork, laboratory, and data analysis methods including competitive binding assays and bioinformatics pipelines. <br/><br/>This research investigates how gut microbes help regulate the stress and immune response in wild, white-faced capuchins (Cebus imitator). The gut microbiome is extremely responsive to the host?s environment; this flexibility likely helps the host regulate their physiology to cope with changes in the environment. Evidence suggests stress and immune physiology are affected by gut microbiome composition, therefore, gut microbiome flexibility to the host?s environment is likely crucial for primate health and fitness. White-faced capuchins cope with drastic seasonal differences in resource levels (i.e. food, water, shade) which offers an opportunity to monitor concurrent changes in the gut microbiome, immune system, and stress physiology in response to environmental change. By combining gut microbiome sampling with non-invasive measures of stress (i.e. fecal glucocorticoids) and immune health (i.e. urinary neopterin), the doctoral student specifically evaluates 1) how the social and ecological environment affect capuchin gut microbiome composition, 2) how gut microbiome composition relates to the stress and immune response, and 3) whether gut microbiome composition and immune and stress physiology respond sequentially to environmental change. This research should provide insight into whether gut microbiome regulation of the stress and immune response is an evolved mechanism that helps primates respond to environmental change.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In many districts, there is a high percentage of teachers who teach outside of their subject area. While the demand for people with STEM backgrounds in the workforce is increasing, the number of college students pursuing STEM teacher preparation is very low. K-12 student success in STEM is linked to high quality instruction by teachers who have strong STEM backgrounds.  In order to counter this problem, this project will run a series of workshops to connect college faculty with K-12 teachers and administrators to understand what knowledge, skills, and other characteristics future STEM teachers need to be successful. The outcome will be the creation of a group of college faculty well-prepared to teach STEM content to pre-service teachers. College administrators will then be able to attract prospective college students to the field of STEM education with a well-deigned STEM teacher preparation program. The premise of this work is that getting teachers, college faculty, and administrators at the table to discuss teachers' needs and abilities will make STEM teacher preparation more successful in the long run.<br/><br/>This project at Nazareth College includes partnerships with the Rochester City School District and Greece Central School District. Project goals include 1) deepening partnerships with two regional high-need school districts; 2) ascertaining the knowledge, skills, and dispositions those districts need in future STEM teachers; 3) developing curriculum, learning experiences, and assignments/assessments at Nazareth, both in STEM content and Education classes that will develop the requisite skills, content knowledge, and dispositions in future Noyce Scholars; 4) providing professional learning for Nazareth faculty to support their utilization of said pedagogies; and 5) identifying the best ways to recruit and retain future educators, from and for those districts when possible. Curricular materials developed will include assignments, lessons or lab activity descriptions, course syllabi, and curricular maps and plans.

By adulthood, humans learn to prioritize the features that allow for the rapid categorization of others by sex, age, and race. People infer a large number of psychologically meaningful attributes about others based on facial features. Effectively studying face processing and its downstream effects on human behavior requires high-quality, valid stimuli. This project expands, enhances and makes available such stimuli to researchers. By improving the Chicago Face Database, this project promotes better scientific practices, helps researchers test new and different questions, pursues basic science questions, and trains historically underrepresented students in the sciences.<br/><br/>The Chicago Face Database currently includes digital images of over 800 Asian, Black, Latinx, multiracial, and White Americans and South Asian Indians. It also includes important ratings and physical measures of the faces. The Chicago Face Database was designed to fill a significant research need: providing high-quality and diverse face stimuli to researchers at no cost. Since being released in 2015, the Chicago Face Database has been downloaded over 8,000 times and cited over 1,400 times, affirming its value to the scientific community. The current project expands and diversifies the Chicago Face Database to include 200 additional images of people photographed in China and Japan, update the subjective ratings of the faces, provide more comprehensive measurements of the faces, and design new web-based tools for accessing the resource and facilitating stimulus selection. In accomplishing these goals, the project addresses basic science questions related to the cross-race recognition deficit, a psychological phenomenon whereby people show better recognition for faces belonging to their own race than to other races.

Techniques like model checking and theorem proving are now used in both the hardware and software industries. Formal techniques are also increasingly being used in scientific modeling, for example in systems biology and in the engineering of complex cyber-physical systems. The biggest challenge facing this technology is the lack of trained users and developers of this technology. The annual Summer School in Formal Techniques addresses this training gap by exposing students to cutting-edge research and technology. The project's novelties are in backing the lectures with hands-on laboratories where the students gain first-hand experience with the technology. To gauge the project's impact, the program will collect valuable feedback from the students on the impact of the summer school lectures on their education and research. The data has shown a strong indication that the lectures cover material that is new and deeply useful to the students, and the laboratory work builds confidence in the use of specific formal techniques. The school also helps to build a social network among the students from which they can draw motivation and support.<br/><br/>The lectures in these schools cover the spectrum of formal techniques; e.g., static analysis, dynamic analysis, model checking, theorem proving, invariant generation, program synthesis, software specification, program verification, and compositional verification, as well as applications in computer security, systems biology, and cyber-physical systems. The lectures at the summer school span a variety of advanced verification techniques, problem domains, and state-of-the-art tools from both academia and industry. The first-hand use of these tools in interactive laboratory sessions is helping the students integrate these technologies into their own research.

It is a key factor in the oceans? ability to absorb fossil fuel carbon dioxide. It is also important to understanding and predicting ocean acidification and may play a role in new technologies to curb climate change. Despite this importance, a great deal remains uncertain about the mechanism and rate of calcium carbonate dissolution. This project will conduct laboratory experiments using new methods to study calcium carbonate dissolution at several different conditions. The project will support two early-career investigators including a graduate student. Results will be shared with the public, including through support of an animation artist. <br/><br/>In previous work, this team and their collaborators have made several improvements to our understanding of the carbonate dissolution rate law in the ocean. Using a novel carbon isotope tracer technique in the lab, and in situ in the water column, they can measure the dissolution rate 20-200x more sensitively than other techniques. This is especially true near equilibrium where rates are slow, but also where most of the ocean resides. Their previous work demonstrated that the rate law has two critical thresholds between three separate modes of surface dissolution mechanisms: near equilibrium, dissolution proceeds as the advance of step edges; with further undersaturation, the free energy in solution opens fast-dissolving etch pits at lattice defects in the solid; furthest from equilibrium, etch pits begin to form homogeneously on the 2-D solid surface leading to maximal dissolution rates. However, understanding of the full chemical control on the rate law, and its interplay with these surface energetic features has yet to be determined. This project will seek to experimentally and theoretically constrain the mechanism behind the rate law for marine carbonate dissolution. The saturation state will be systematically changed as a function of other aspects of the chemistry to test the elementary reactions that have been successfully used for years to describe dissolution in freshwaters. The saturation state will be varied over a range of sulfate concentrations, calcium/carbonate ratios, and magnesium/calcium ratios in independent experiments. Both the initial time dependence of the raw data, and SIMS microprobe profiles of the experimental solids will allow determination of the gross precipitation and gross dissolution rates in conjunction with the net rate constraints from slopes of dissolved carbon isotope ratios produced versus time.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Frailty is an aging syndrome related to low physiological reserves in organs and systems and is associated with increased risk of hospitalization, adverse therapy outcomes, disability, and mortality. The proposed application of the technology is to risk stratify hospitalized and community dwelling older adults and will be implemented through a smartwatch and smartphone to measure frailty in under 5 minutes.  Monitoring technologies, such as the proposed frailty score, have the potential to improve older people?s safety, manage their health and assist them in maintaining their independence. Additionally, these technologies hold the promise of enormous cost savings for the healthcare system by enhancing the ability of providers to provide timely intervention prior to a patient?s deterioration requiring acute care.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a novel objective sensor-based frailty assessment tool. In this frailty tool, for the first time, instead of assessing characteristics of physiological systems in basal resting-state conditions, a provocative physical stress test will be employed to quantify the level of physiological reserve within and across cardiac and motor systems. Biomechanics approaches including muscle model and heart rate dynamics analysis will be used to characterize motor and cardiac system behaviors. In addition, the proposed technology may be used to assess dynamic interactions between the motor and cardiac systems using state space reconstruction of motor and heart rate behaviors within the stress-response model. The test takes 60 seconds to perform (repetitive and fast elbow flexion) and can provide the frailty score immediately after the test. The proposed approach has been validated cross-sectionally using comprehensive frailty assessment approaches that take 45-60 minutes and longitudinally based on adverse hospital/treatment outcomes, readmission, and mortality.  In addition to the sensor-based frailty score, the technology has been transformed from more expensive equipment to a simple smartwatch platform.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project is specifically motivated by 3D printing, an $11 billion and rapidly growing industry within advanced manufacturing that is critical to national security, supply chain resiliency, and economic prosperity.  The adoption of 3D printing for mainstream manufacturing is often hindered by the low speed of 3D printers. A major hindrance to high-speed 3D printing is vibration, which causes loss of quality at high-speed operation. This project seeks to develop a low-cost, software-based approach for mitigating the vibration of 3D printers. A major impediment to the effectiveness of the proposed software solution is the need for accurate calibration of the changing vibration behavior of 3D printers under varying operating conditions. This project will develop a set of automatic calibration techniques to address this impediment. The software algorithms developed through this project will not only benefit 3D printing but would also apply to a wide range of advanced manufacturing machines, like machine tools and robots, whose speed and accuracy are often limited by vibration. <br/><br/>This Small Business Technology Transfer Phase II project seeks to develop a suite of automatic calibration techniques to enable a proprietary vibration compensation algorithm to adapt to frequent changes in vibration behavior of 3D printers that occur in the field. To achieve this goal, three technical objectives will be pursued. The first technical objective will involve the development of a sensor-less auto calibration technique that continuously updates the calibration of 3D printers whose moving mass and vibration behavior changes as material is being deposited on the print bed. The second technical objective will focus on the development of a sensor-based, autocalibration technique that uses shallow machine learning to continuously fine-tune the calibration maps of 3D printers with onboard accelerometers. The third technical objective will involve the development of a sensor-based autocalibration-as-a-service technique primarily for 3D printers that do not have onboard accelerometers. To achieve these objectives, research is needed to overcome technical hurdles that hinder the accuracy and computational efficiency of the proposed auto-calibration approaches. The intellectual merit of this project is in developing science-based approaches that overcome the technical hurdles and their associated risks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These microorganisms use inorganic nitrogen (N) from the water to make a variety of amino acids. Some of the amino acids keep the initial chemical signature (i.e., N isotope value) of their N source. Other amino acids are involved in metabolic processes that change the initial chemical signature (N isotope value). These distinct N isotope signatures are passed along to organisms that consume phytoplankton and throughout the food web. Thus, the N isotope values of individual amino acids can be used to obtain the isotope value of N sources supporting food webs and to estimate the trophic position of organisms in biota, particles, coral skeletons, and sediments. But, this requires a clear understanding of the N isotope patterns of amino acids produced by phytoplankton. This project will examine whether different phytoplankton species produce amino acids with distinct N isotope patterns when using the same N source. The project will also study whether the N isotope patterns produced by the same species of phytoplankton change under different growth and environmental conditions. Information from this study will improve the ability to use N isotope values in amino acids in ecological and biogeochemical studies. This collaborative project combines novel research with broader impacts focused on engaging the public and promoting diversity and inclusion at various levels. Three graduate students and one postdoc will participate in the research. Research opportunities will be provided to undergraduate students, especially those with backgrounds. Students will be recruited through the McNair and Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation program at Texas A&M Univ. at Corpus Christi, a Hispanic Serving and Minority Serving Institution. To share results broadly, the investigators and students will give talks about marine science to local K-12 students in Corpus Christi TX. The New Bedford High School (in MA) summer marine intern program will be engaged in this project. Public lectures will be given on the topic of algal blooms and a children?s article will be written on the topic of isotopes. Outcomes of this project will also be incorporated into presentations to the Chesapeake Bay Program, Maryland Harmful Algal Bloom Task Force, and the Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee of the Maryland Coastal Bays. <br/> <br/>The use of N isotope values of different amino acids (?15N-AA) to retrieve the N source isotope signature of food webs and estimate trophic positions depends on information about the ?15N-AA produced by phytoplankton at the base of the food web which is still poorly understood. This study seeks to explore fundamental scientific questions to better understand ?15N-AA produced by phytoplankton. 1) Under the same nitrogenous nutrient and growth conditions, do ?15N-AA patterns vary between major phytoplankton groups? Are the unique ?15N-AA patterns in diatoms related to unique aspects of their N metabolism? 2) Do changes in phytoplankton physiology resulting from nitrogenous nutrient availability, N form utilized (ammonium, nitrate, and mixed), and/or other growth conditions independently produce significant changes in ?15N-AA? Phytoplankton samples will be collected from controlled culture (e.g., chemostat) experiments and from field studies in the Gulf of Mexico and Chesapeake Bay, especially during near-monospecific bloom events. By taking the advantage of newly developed analytical approaches, new knowledge of compound and intramolecular ?15N of poly-N AA such as arginine, asparagine, glutamine, and histidine in phytoplankton will be generated for the first time. This ground-truthing work will advance the understanding of ?15N-AA pattern produced by key phytoplankton species critical to the biological pump and harmful algal blooms under environmentally relevant physiological conditions. The expected outcomes from this work will enable new applications and more sophisticated trophic position analyses, studies of the efficiency of the ocean?s biological pump, and paleo-oceanographic reconstructions using amino acids preserved in natural archives.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While there are legitimate concerns about how the use of these tools could be detrimental to learning, this research project aims to leverage language models to better prepare engineering learners of the 21st Century. The research project will use modern AI and machine learning (ML) tools to automate analysis of student-written responses to challenging concept questions. These qualitative questions are often used in large STEM classes to support active learning pedagogies; they require minimum calculations and focus on the application of underlying physical and chemical phenomena to various situations. With previous NSF funding, we have developed the Concept Warehouse (NSF DUE 1023099, 1821439, 2135190), a classroom response system where students provide written justifications to concept questions. Providing written justifications targets development of reasoning and sense-making skills in students and can also better prepare them for discussions with peers resulting in broader effectiveness of active learning pedagogies. However, expository prose also presents a daunting amount of information for instructors to process. In this project, we will leverage recent advancements in machine learning tools and natural language processing technologies to develop automated processes to analyze student-written justifications to challenging concept questions.<br/><br/>This project will join engineering education researchers at Tufts University and AI/ML researchers at the University of Massachusetts Lowell. We will focus on the following research questions: (1) Based on human coding, what ideas do students use in explaining challenging concept questions in statics? How do these vary among challenging concept questions studied? (2) How well can Transformer-based ML models replicate the coding done by the human coders? For isomorphic question pairs, how well do ML models trained on the first question?s explanations perform on the second question? More generally, can ML-based coding based on one question be applied successfully to code the data for other questions, and what are the limits to this generalizability? We will complete three research tasks: (1) data collection of written responses for the same concept questions from nine or more engineering statics instructors at different institutions; (2) manual coding of a subset of students? written explanations, and (3) developing and evaluating ML coding methods, followed by ML coding of the complete set of collected written explanations. While the project focuses on engineering statics, it is expected that findings will transfer to challenging questions in other engineering and science topics. Ultimately, successful implementation of machine learning will support learning and instruction of challenging concepts. Expected outcomes include a developing understanding of advantages and disadvantages of different ML approaches including their accuracy, determination of minimum data size requirements to apply the algorithms, and the ability to transfer learning from one question to isomorphic questions that require similar reasoning patterns. For instructors, data generated can provide real-time information about the different ways students are reasoning with examples of common cases. For engineering education researchers, characterizing explanations in different settings will support investigations of how student thinking relates to instructional practices and environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, over the course of millions of years, select lineages of fishes have crossed the  boundary between marine and freshwaters, established permanent residence, and diversified in the newly colonized environment. A subset of the fish groups then underwent remarkable evolutionary expansion upon colonizing freshwaters, diversifying into an array of different species that play different ecological roles. Australia and New Guinea are unique because their freshwater fish communities are primarily comprised of lineages derived from marine ancestors, and at least seven such lineages underwent spectacular diversification. This project will explore how varying rates of evolution, ages of different fish groups, and the interactions among fish communities have influenced the evolutionary outcomes of colonizing freshwaters in the Australia-New Guinea region. The study also aims to determine the genetic mechanisms underlying adaptation to freshwater environments, findings of particular relevance to a changing planet. The project will train undergraduate and graduate students in modern biodiversity science, and through student exchanges, provide benefits to US and New Guinean students. High school teachers will be trained to read, interpret, and teach the evolutionary Tree of Life, skills that can be incorporated into K-12 curriculum. Finally, an electronic guide the fishes of New Guinea will be developed and made freely available. <br/><br/>While much progress has been achieved in identifying the drivers of adaptive radiation in relation to colonization of islands by terrestrial animals (e.g., finches, anoles) or lakes by fishes (e.g., cichlids, sticklebacks), transitions into rivers by marine groups have rarely been examined in this context. The proposed project will take advantage of a unique 'natural experiment'??the depauperate primary freshwater fish community in rivers of Australia and New Guinea??to examine the extent to which marine-to-freshwater transitions resulted in adaptive radiations. More specifically, it aims to identify the factors that promoted or constrained lineage, phenotypic, and genomic evolution of marine-derived freshwater groups in the region. The project will integrate genomic, morphological, paleontological, and ecological data from more than 400 fish species representing 16 families in the Australia and New Guinea region to study diversification patterns associated not only with transitions across the marine-freshwater boundary but also along the benthic-pelagic axis. Phylogenomic analyses in combination with phylogenetic comparative methods will be used to study how the chronological sequence of habitat transitions influenced the outcome of lineage diversification and morphological evolution of freshwater radiations. Comparative genomic approaches based on whole genomes will be used to identify loci related to functional adaptations, including signatures of molecular adaptation and convergence, as well as gene family expansions and contractions. Ultimately this project will provide an evolutionary framework to help understand the factors regulating adaptive radiations across environmental gradients. It will include student training in fish biodiversity at a variety of levels.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Systematics and Biodiversity Science Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Like other rural states, Montana has a shortage of high-quality STEM teacher leaders in many geographically isolated, STEM-underrepresented, and high-needs schools and communities, particularly on and near Montana?s seven American Indian reservations. High-quality STEM teacher leaders can make a huge difference?inspiring young students to learn STEM content knowledge and pursue STEM careers, which ultimately broadens the diversity of the country?s STEM workforce. To develop high-quality STEM teacher leaders, qualified practicing STEM teachers must be recruited, trained, retained and provided ongoing support to develop their teaching competencies and hone their leadership skills.<br/><br/>This project at Montana State University will assess the needs of STEM teachers in potential partner schools on or near four reservations (Flathead, Blackfeet, Northern Cheyenne, and Crow) while building a network of collaborators within and beyond the university. Together, these partners will develop effective methods for recruiting and selecting experienced and exemplary STEM teachers to become teacher leaders; and identify or recommend a meaningful, culturally sustaining teacher leadership development model appropriate for high-need rural and reservation communities. Our ultimate goal is to build the capacity to support a cohort of dedicated, high-quality and culturally sustaining teacher leaders who can implement and develop exemplary practices for supporting rural and American Indian students. The findings and suggested practices generated from this project will advance our knowledge and enhance our expertise on creating scaffolds to develop experienced, exemplary STEM teachers to become teacher leaders in high-need rural and minority school districts.

Heat, photons (light), and electrons provide different energy sources to initiate chemical reactions. While reactions initiated by heat and light are well studied, electron-induced reactions are less well understood, even though they play a crucial role in biology, chemistry, and technology. Professor Matsika and her research group are developing efficient and accurate methods to describe processes initiated by electrons. The developed methods will be tested by comparisons with experimental spectra provided by collaborators, and they will be applied to study reactions related to biological damage, astrochemistry and catalysis. Of special importance will be reactions involved in radiation damage to components of DNA, related to cancer and cancer therapies. This work will have broader impacts in the education of graduate and undergraduate students as well as postdoctoral fellows. Dr. Matsika will also make efforts to enhance involvement of students from underrepresented groups in research and science.  This research plan will give the opportunity to postdoctoral fellows, as well as graduate and undergraduate students to get training in theoretical methods development and in applications of quantum mechanical methods to challenging problems.<br/><br/>A major problem with electron-driven processes is that the states formed when an electron is attached to a molecular system are often metastable and can decay fast via autodetachment, so one must treat them properly as resonances. Since resonances are not bound states, conventional quantum chemical methods cannot be applied, and modifications are needed to describe the energies and lifetimes of these metastable states. To make progress in the theoretical description of electron-driven processes the Matsika group will focus on the following objectives: 1) Efficient multireference methods combined with complex absorbing potentials will be developed.  2) These methods will be used to explore complex potential energy surfaces and conical intersections between complex surfaces. On the fly dynamics for temporary anions will be performed, and spectroscopic observables (such as time resolved photoelectron spectra) will be calculated. 3) The methods will be benchmarked by collaboration with experimental groups. The Matsika group will focus on a range of applications that aim at a better understanding of interactions of electrons with molecules relevant to biology, astrochemistry, and catalysis. Particularly, the team seeks to obtain a more complete picture of electron-induced damage to biomolecules, particularly nucleobases. The methodology developed will be implemented in open-source software.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The intention of this proposal is to develop clear pathways from the community college into the main university campus, and to develop an understanding of student perceptions about STEM and the teaching profession to better recruit and prepare STEM teachers. The intended collaboration between Dona Ana Community College (DACC) and New Mexico State University (NMSU) will be essential for building sustainable STEM educator pathways. These partners will work together to create practices that address what STEM undergraduates need to become effective STEM teachers. To accomplish these aims, both institutions will develop STEM degree concentrations to support a future Noyce Track 1 proposal.  Additionally, data analysis aimed at understanding STEM student interest in simultaneously pursuing a major in a STEM discipline and a minor in Secondary Education at both institutions will be used to develop a recruitment plan for Noyce Scholars. As one of six minority-as-majority states, New Mexico?s schooling environment exhibits the complex educational, cultural, and economic challenges occurring throughout the United States. With NMSU located within three school districts along the US-Mexico border and producing only a small number of mathematics or science pre-service teachers, this region echos the national declining trend in teacher production. At the same time, there is a state-wide need for STEM prepared employees in military, space, and agriculturally based industries.  <br/><br/>This project at Dona Ana Community College includes a partnership with New Mexico State University. Project goals include the development of teacher education pathways that allow STEM majors to minor in Education, and the development of a recruitment plan. We will draw on research about the importance of teachers having high levels of content and pedagogical knowledge and intend on centering our recruitment plans on the needs of students from underrepresented minority groups given the demographics of the students at both institutions. Additionally, we will draw on approaches to collaboration that foster organizational boundary-spanning activities that lead to new inter-institutional norms. We will collect data from students through survey research about levels of interest in STEM teaching to design a recruitment plan. This project will allow both institutions to prepare teachers so they can successfully prepare their students for STEM learning despite strained socio-economic supports. Successful strategies implemented and documented from this project can be a model for replication at similar institutions. The independent evaluation approach for this capacity-building project, conducted by the Southwest Outreach Academic Research Evaluation and Policy Center, will be both formative and summative. Project outcomes will be disseminated through local, state, and national conferences.  This Capacity Building project is supported through the Robert Noyce Teacher Scholarship Program (Noyce). The Noyce program supports talented STEM undergraduate majors and professionals to become effective K-12 STEM teachers and experienced, exemplary K-12 teachers to become STEM master teachers in high-need school districts. It also supports research on the effectiveness and retention of K-12 STEM teachers in high-need school districts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many DHH students are in K-12 classes and often are the only DHH student or one of few DHH students with a sign language interpreter. Despite the surge of STEM sign language development and its popularity in the media, technical terminology in sign languages for STEM terms and concepts is still lacking, and what does exist is not widely known. Most current STEM sign language lexicons focus primarily on creating a collection of single-word, single-sign videos within a small cohort of individuals. However, this current framework prevents widespread dissemination and conceptually accurate sharing of information to K-12 schools, K-12 interpreters, and DHH STEM professionals. To solve these issues, this project will organize a series of workshops that will culminate with a summit to discuss the current state of STEM sign lexicons around the world.<br/> <br/>This project aims to assess and evaluate the use and success of STEM sign language lexicons in three critical areas. First, the team will evaluate the ethical and linguistic implications of robust STEM sign language development by researchers and the downstream impact on the educational community. Second, participants and organizers will develop assessment and evaluation tools for the K-12 classroom and extra-curricular activities. Finally, the participants will formulate new research directions to ensure sustainability of STEM sign language lexicons in the digital world. The project includes a series of convenings to bring together STEM education, linguistics, and anthropology experts along with the developers and leaders of current STEM sign language lexicons to lead new research that improves STEM education for DHH students in K-12 settings.<br/><br/>This project is supported by NSF's EHR Core Research (ECR) program.

Currently, the limited range and payloads of small electric aircraft make them economically unviable on most routes.  Increased aerodynamic efficiency is required for longer range. The circulation control technology being developed generates extremely high lift only when needed (takeoff and landing), but unlike other propulsion-based approaches aimed at the same effect, it is low cost and allows for a smaller and more efficient wing without any mass or performance drawbacks for the cruise portion of flight where range is needed. More rapid adoption of electric aircraft will enhance US leadership in this nascent field, facilitate the use of the country?s 5000 small, regional airports for transformative, quiet, accessible, electric air mobility, and become a new area of economic growth in underserved parts of the country. Moreover, decarbonization is an urgent challenge in aviation, with the industry being among the least able to electrify. Radical new aerodynamic approaches and configurations must be adopted, such as those which the proposed technology will enable, to reach a true net zero future for air transportation.   <br/><br/>This project involves research and development of novel aerodynamic circulation control applied to the wings of electric planes to generate extremely high lift. The technology introduces a high-energy narrow jet of air over control surfaces like flaps, allowing for much higher deflections and potentially tripling the lift of a wing at takeoff and landing. Previously deemed too risky and expensive for commercial application by industry based on earlier concepts fueled by combustion engines and complex plumbing, this innovation simplifies the physical implementation in a way that is only now possible with the latest electric aircraft architectures. This project develops a combination of high-fidelity computational fluid dynamics simulations and physical aerodynamic testing to uncover the fundamental turbulent flow characteristics that must be produced to ensure that maximum wing lift coefficients of 4 to 5 can be achieved reliably, particularly in off-design conditions. Detailed performance modeling will establish benchmarks of existing vs. modified performance to include circulation control and then apply this data to an entirely new type of maximum efficiency wing that can become a new industry standard.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The experimental plans include the use of growth chambers under controlled conditions combined with field data to study the uptake of HONO onto leaves from a range of tree species that dominate major forested regions across North America. Since HONO is not well represented in chemical transport models, improvements in understanding HONO sources and sinks are expected to have important implications for improving air quality models and for determining the lifetime of some greenhouse gases, such as methane, in the atmosphere.<br/><br/>This effort combines expertise in atmospheric chemistry, microbial ecology, and modeling with unique analytical capabilities for measuring HONO soil emissions. The central hypothesis of this proposal is that variations in below-canopy hydrogen oxide radical (HOx) cycling and ozone levels in forested regions are driven by the variability of soil emissions of HONO (SHONO) and nitrogen oxide (NO) (SNO), that depend on season, edaphic properties, aboveground vegetation surfaces, and belowground nitrogen cycling that is mediated by microbe-plant interactions. Preliminary data show that high SNO has a significant impact on below canopy HOx in a forested environment, that NOy (the sum of reactive nitrogen oxides) fluxes are linked to forest composition, and that spatial variability in NOy fluxes can be mapped across the continental U.S. using forest inventory plots. The objectives of the research are to: (1) Establish geospatial trends in SHONO across U.S. forests; (2) Carry out field campaigns to measure SHONO in mixed deciduous forests; and (3) Quantify uptake of HONO by leaf and soil surfaces.<br/><br/>The project will support a full-time postdoctoral researcher and a graduate student who will receive training in state-of-the science analytical and modeling methods.

While the fossil record provides evidence for physical adaptations related to changing habitats and diets, it remains unclear how the evolution of human social behavior was shaped by changes in food availability. To address this gap, non-invasive research on wild nonhuman primates can provide comparative data for reconstructing the potential behaviors of early human ancestors. This doctoral dissertation research project leverages data from a long-studied, wild nonhuman primate population that has undergone significant habitat change. The research focuses on two potential mechanisms shaping social behavior: the distribution of food in a landscape and its quality. The project promotes the progress of science by advancing our understanding of primate sociality and how major climatic shifts may have shaped human social evolution. Additionally, understanding the consequences of long-term habitat change for an endangered primate can inform conservation research and activities. The project also promotes international research collaborations, provides scientific training to undergraduate students and community members, and strengthens community relationships and promotes environmental stewardship through outreach events that highlight habitat recovery in protected landscapes. <br/><br/>Chimpanzees show wide variation in sociality and the quality of landscapes they inhabit. Researchers suspect that differences in food availability drive chimpanzee social variation; however, research sites also differ in terms of ecology and methods, which has largely prevented studies directly comparing populations. Long-term data on one population of chimpanzees provide a unique opportunity to explore the consequences of temporal and spatial habitat variation on behavior. Systematic data collection beginning in the 1970s has captured detailed behavioral observations across six decades of significant habitat recovery from anthropogenic disturbance. Supplementing 66 community-years of existing behavioral observations and 20 years of phenology data, the researchers collect original focal follow data and non-invasive urine samples for energetic biomarker analysis. They also use historic feeding data and remote-sensed landscape metrics to construct spatial models of plant food species distribution from 1980-2020. Together, these data are analyzed to establish linkages between food availability, diet composition, individual energetic state, and behavior. The researchers also identify how food distribution influences ranging and sociality, as well as the impact of a given individual?s range quality on their ability to engage in energetically demanding social behaviors. Overall, this research expands understanding of hominin social evolution, the drivers of intraspecific behavioral differences in chimpanzees, and the behavioral consequences of habitat recovery in an endangered primate.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These microorganisms use inorganic nitrogen (N) from the water to make a variety of amino acids. Some of the amino acids keep the initial chemical signature (i.e., N isotope value) of their N source. Other amino acids are involved in metabolic processes that change the initial chemical signature (N isotope value). These distinct N isotope signatures are passed along to organisms that consume phytoplankton and throughout the food web. Thus, the N isotope values of individual amino acids can be used to obtain the isotope value of N sources supporting food webs and to estimate the trophic position of organisms in biota, particles, coral skeletons, and sediments. But, this requires a clear understanding of the N isotope patterns of amino acids produced by phytoplankton. This project will examine whether different phytoplankton species produce amino acids with distinct N isotope patterns when using the same N source. The project will also study whether the N isotope patterns produced by the same species of phytoplankton change under different growth and environmental conditions. Information from this study will improve the ability to use N isotope values in amino acids in ecological and biogeochemical studies. This collaborative project combines novel research with broader impacts focused on engaging the public and promoting diversity and inclusion at various levels. Three graduate students and one postdoc will participate in the research. Research opportunities will be provided to undergraduate students, especially those with backgrounds. Students will be recruited through the McNair and Louis Stokes Alliances for Minority Participation program at Texas A&M Univ. at Corpus Christi, a Hispanic Serving and Minority Serving Institution. To share results broadly, the investigators and students will give talks about marine science to local K-12 students in Corpus Christi TX. The New Bedford High School (in MA) summer marine intern program will be engaged in this project. Public lectures will be given on the topic of algal blooms and a children?s article will be written on the topic of isotopes. Outcomes of this project will also be incorporated into presentations to the Chesapeake Bay Program, Maryland Harmful Algal Bloom Task Force, and the Scientific and Technical Advisory Committee of the Maryland Coastal Bays. <br/> <br/>The use of N isotope values of different amino acids (?15N-AA) to retrieve the N source isotope signature of food webs and estimate trophic positions depends on information about the ?15N-AA produced by phytoplankton at the base of the food web which is still poorly understood. This study seeks to explore fundamental scientific questions to better understand ?15N-AA produced by phytoplankton. 1) Under the same nitrogenous nutrient and growth conditions, do ?15N-AA patterns vary between major phytoplankton groups? Are the unique ?15N-AA patterns in diatoms related to unique aspects of their N metabolism? 2) Do changes in phytoplankton physiology resulting from nitrogenous nutrient availability, N form utilized (ammonium, nitrate, and mixed), and/or other growth conditions independently produce significant changes in ?15N-AA? Phytoplankton samples will be collected from controlled culture (e.g., chemostat) experiments and from field studies in the Gulf of Mexico and Chesapeake Bay, especially during near-monospecific bloom events. By taking the advantage of newly developed analytical approaches, new knowledge of compound and intramolecular ?15N of poly-N AA such as arginine, asparagine, glutamine, and histidine in phytoplankton will be generated for the first time. This ground-truthing work will advance the understanding of ?15N-AA pattern produced by key phytoplankton species critical to the biological pump and harmful algal blooms under environmentally relevant physiological conditions. The expected outcomes from this work will enable new applications and more sophisticated trophic position analyses, studies of the efficiency of the ocean?s biological pump, and paleo-oceanographic reconstructions using amino acids preserved in natural archives.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Biological and Chemical Oceanography Programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Other potential applications of the proposed technology include vaccine quality assessment and detecting other neurological disorders.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a signal processing algorithm for utilizing Electron Spin Resonance (ESR) signals, a magnetic resonance spectroscopic technique, to detect the structural changes between two locations in proteins with biomarker precision. Determination of such structural changes using existing data analysis techniques from low-resolution ESR signals of blood samples containing the potential biomarker at critically low concentration is virtually impossible. The proposed data analytics is highly sensitive and selective in extracting the relevant structural parameters from data collected under these conditions. It has been confirmed that a protein, SOD1, in the blood is associated with ALS disease onset and progression. Specifically, the distance between the copper (Cu) centers in SOD1 increases from its standard value (healthy state) in the case of ALS patients.  To measure the distance between two Cu centers in SOD1, the proposed algorithm carries out point-wise distance reconstruction, avoiding interference from neighboring points yielding local information in a precise manner. In proof-of-concept studies, structural changes were detected in SOD1 using the proposed data analytics at blood concentration levels. This technology may enable the development of a non-invasive and cost-effective diagnostic for ALS.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Homotopy type theory is a new field of Mathematics that draws on multiple disciplines, including logic, homotopy theory, category theory, and computer science. It is closely tied to the development of new computerized proof assistants that permit mathematical proofs to be constructed interactively and verified to be correct.  Student participants will learn about both the theory and practice of such computational tools, which are becoming increasingly important in the exact sciences.<br/><br/>Homotopy type theory is based on recently discovered connections between constructive type theory, homotopy theory, and higher category theory.  Martin-Lf?s dependent type theory is a formal system that underlies computerized proof assistants such as Lean, Coq, and Agda.  This system was recently shown to interpret into certain higher-categories originally developed for homotopy theory.  As a result, it can also be used for reasoning in higher mathematics.  Importantly, the proof assistants based on it can then be used to formally verify difficult results in these areas not previously attainable by such tools.  Extensions to the system suggested by the new applications also greatly extend the range of mathematics that can be developed and formalized using proof assistants.

A tenet of neuroscience is that higher-order computations are performed by neural circuits in the central nervous system (CNS), not the peripheral nervous system (PNS). However, this might not be universally true for all types of animals.  This project examines whether olfactory processing circuitry in a mollusc is found in the PNS rather than the CNS, as it is in other animal phyla such as vertebrates and insects. The project uses the nudibranch mollusc, Berghia stephanieae, which is a charismatic lab-grown species that is an inexpensive alternative to many other neuroscience laboratory species, thereby increasing access to research for students. Berghia, like other gastropod molluscs has large, individually identifiable neurons in its CNS. However, like its distant cousin, the octopus, far more small neurons are located in its PNS, which contains peripheral ganglia and sub-epithelial neurons. Anthropocentricism has biased researchers to believe that the brain is more important than the periphery. However, this might not be true for all types of nervous systems. Determining the extent to which peripheral systems in molluscs perform computations that were thought to be reserved for the brain could transform our view of what actually constitutes a brain.<br/><br/>The goal of the project is to elucidate the neural architecture and function of the peripheral rhinophore complex, which consists of the rhinophore, a dorsal cephalic appendage used for distance chemoreception, and the associated rhinophore ganglion. A connectomics and transcriptomics approach will be used to determine whether there are glomeruli in the rhinophore complex that are organized like olfactory glomeruli in the olfactory bulb of vertebrates and the antennal lobe of insects. There are three objectives: 1) A connectome of the rhinophore ganglion will be constructed from volume serial electron microscopic images using machine-learning algorithms to determine the neural circuit motifs that it contains. Customization of machine-learning algorithms to the ultrastructural features of Berghia will facilitate connectomics research in other molluscs. 2) An atlas of neuronal types will be assembled, which will include neurons in the rhinophore complex and neurons that input to it. Neural gene expression, determined from single cell RNA sequencing, will be mapped using in situ hybridization chain reaction (HCR), immunohistochemistry (IHC), and axon tracing. A web portal will provide access to the annotated connectome and neuronal atlas, allowing researchers and students to explore genes, neurons, and neural circuitry in Berghia. 3) The role of the rhinophore complex in navigational behavior will be explored with behavioral assays and selective lesions, taking advantage of Berghia?s regenerative abilities. Laboratory courses developed using Berghia will allow undergraduate students to label and image neurons with HCR and IHC and perform behavioral experiments with automated tracking. This will enable students to make discoveries and test hypotheses regarding neurons and neural circuits in parallel to the discoveries made by laboratory researchers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Photocatalytic CO2 reduction by harnessing solar energy represents one of the most attractive strategies that may simultaneously address the global warming issue and fulfill the future energy demand.  The research is supplemented by diverse educational and outreach activities, including encouraging graduate and undergraduate students, especially underrepresented minority groups, into careers in STEM research, and providing opportunities for students/teachers ranging from elementary to high schools to advance their general understanding of catalysis and renewable energy technologies. <br/><br/>Supported single atoms (SAs) have emerged as a novel class of catalysts, offering new promise for light-driven CO2 reduction. The focus of prior research is largely on documenting the efficiency, stability, and the selectivity of the catalysts, not the fundamental mechanistic studies that underlines the correlation of SA structure and their photocatalytic performance. To address such gaps in knowledge, Professor Gu and Professor Huang target the following objectives by leveraging their complementary expertise in materials design and synthesis with time resolved spectroscopy:  1) systematically tuning the geometric and electronic structures of supported SAs via altering the intrinsic nature of SAs, the metal-support interaction, and the comparison with nanoparticles with various sizes; 2) examining the charge separation and structural dynamics, and resolving the intermediate structures at catalytic active sites with high temporal and spatial resolution using time resolved optical and X-ray absorption spectroscopy; and 3) evaluating the direct correlation of the structures of the supported SA catalysts with their photophysical properties and catalytic function to establish structure-property-function relationships for CO2 reduction.

In recent decades, population growth and economic development in hazard-prone regions have highlighted the need for resilient civil infrastructures that can efficiently serve communities with a variety of essential services, especially in the aftermath of extreme events. To help students become future leaders who can address the challenges faced by civil infrastructures in the 21st century, systematic research and educational activities toward achieving infrastructure resilience are critical. Resilience is described as the capacity of communities to continue to function under stresses that include both episodic natural disasters and slow-moving deteriorations due to aging mechanisms. Despite the variety of efforts made in this domain to date, the current training programs often lag in equipping students with the latest knowledge and skillsets required at both component and system levels. This has formulated the main motivation for establishing the INSPIRE Site, as synergistic activities and international exchanges are key to preparing a diverse group of students capable of integrating innovative structural solutions and planning strategies for infrastructure resilience, especially in an evolving climate.<br/><br/>The INSPIRE Site will provide unique international research and educational experiences for a broad spectrum of undergraduate and graduate students in collaboration with the Swiss Federal University of Technology (ETH Zrich) and Swiss Federal Laboratories for Materials Science and Technology (Empa) in Switzerland. The objective is to provide students with a global perspective and a suite of opportunities for professional growth through meaningful international cooperative research training, networking, and mentoring in the fields related to advanced structural solutions and data-enabled planning and management for infrastructure resilience. The students will conduct individual projects and team-based investigations focused on assessing the condition of civil infrastructures and developing effective solutions to improve their condition state, considering various safety and performance aspects. This international partnership will have significant broader impacts, strengthening institutional capacity among a diverse group of stakeholders through collaborations across academic, industry, and international partners. Through various educational, mentoring, outreach, and evaluation activities, the INSPIRE Site will ensure a caring and supportive environment, especially for broadening participation in the critical domain of civil infrastructure resilience.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Resilience to these changes depends on interactions between environmental features, behavior, and physiology that enable species to access suitable microclimates. Ecosystem engineers are species that modify their environment by creating structures, such as burrows, which can provide more stable temperature and humidity, buffering occupants against temperature extremes. The actions of these organisms are important not only for their own persistence but to enable other species to access suitable microclimates. The Mojave desert tortoise is an ecosystem engineer that creates burrows for shelter and nesting and is threatened with extinction, in part due to climate change. The youngest tortoise life stages - eggs, hatchlings, and juveniles - are particularly vulnerable to temperature extremes due to their small size and limited ability to modify their environment. These life stages rely on maternal nest placement or small mammal burrows for protection. This project aims to understand how desert tortoises modify their environment through burrow creation, to characterize how thermoregulation is achieved via burrow use, and to measure the effectiveness of burrows to buffer against rising temperature across life stages, with a particular emphasis on nesting females and early life stages. This research will provide new data on the resiliency of each life stage to climate extremes and will inform life stage-specific models of species distribution under future climate scenarios, identifying sites that may become climate refugia. This work will develop grade-specific educational modules and classroom kits that integrate active desert tortoise conservation research and will implement these modules in local classrooms. This project will also provide training opportunities for K-12 teachers, undergraduate students, a graduate student, and a post-doctoral trainee. This project is being supported via a joint program involving the Divisions of Environmental Biology and Integrative Organismal Systems and the Paul G. Allen Family Foundation.<br/><br/>This research takes a mechanistic approach to evaluate the role of behavioral and physiological flexibility in determining resilience to climate change for the endangered Mojave desert tortoise across life stages, an important ecosystem engineer. The research seeks to characterize temperature sensitivity of eggs and maternal nesting behavior; test the effects of temperature and hydric status on juvenile burrow use, burrow morphology, and body temperature; quantify the thermal buffering capacity of behavior and burrows across age classes in wild tortoises; and use respirometry to characterize temperature effects on energy expenditure, water loss and thermal preference. These studies will provide key physiological parameters for life stage-specific mechanistic niche models (MNMs) of response to altered climate to identify optimal habitat for desert tortoises that will persist into the future. Finally, this research will test MNM predictions by collecting environmental data from model-selected sites. By identifying climate refugia and core conservation areas, these models will inform future focal sites for Mojave desert tortoise recovery activities, including restoration and assisted migration. More broadly, results will be relevant for the extended group of burrowing species and commensal organisms that use burrows, and lead to improved empirical and modelling methods for forecasting the impacts of climate change on this diverse group of organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It has lead to vast improvements and simpler proofs of many results. It has also provided notions of singularities that are defined purely algebraically but correspond, somewhat mysteriously, to types of singularities that appear in birational geometry over the field of complex numbers. Commutative algebra in mixed characteristic, the study of rings that do not contain any field, has seen the introduction of new methods and spectacular advances through the recent solution of the celebrated homological conjectures. The scientific school and workshop at ICTP will give students early-career mathematicians an opportunity to get involved in these fast moving areas, and more experienced researchers will have a chance to initiate new trans-national collaborations.

Sylvatic (better known as bubonic) plague was introduced to North America in 1900 and is now maintained in native mammals in the western U.S., periodically eliciting disease outbreaks. Although some species seem to have natural resistance, others?such as prairie dogs?are highly susceptible. Despite the detection of plague resistance in a small number of prairie dogs, the disease still decimates populations throughout their range. The continued susceptibility of prairie dogs suggests there is some constraint inhibiting the widespread evolution of resistance to plague. This project uses whole-genome and transcriptome sequencing of resistant and susceptible prairie dogs to determine the genomic basis of recently evolved plague resistance. Mutations associated with resistance in natural populations and experiments will then be mapped in nature to determine the spatial distribution of resistance alleles and predict the location of potential resistance hotspots. Museum specimens of prairie dogs will also be genotyped to determine the rate of evolution of plague resistance. Given the increasing rate of novel pathogens emerging around the globe, this research will have broad implications for understanding when and where adaptation in nave hosts is likely to persist. This project will use research to enhance education by building capacity in universities serving Native American and Hispanic students. Traveling genomics workshops will be delivered to students and faculty, and students will be mentored at their own institutions as they conduct independent research in the system.<br/><br/>Adaptation to pathogens should be heavily favored by selection: Once immunity evolves, it should sweep to fixation across a species? range. Paradoxically, a more commonly observed pattern is variable immunity. Because there are multiple explanations for incomplete resistance, the ecological and evolutionary conditions under which resistance to novel pathogens is maintained are still poorly understood. For instance, to what extent does the habitat matrix influence the maintenance of resistance through processes such as gene dilution? Does the de novo evolution of resistance independently across populations lead to epistatic interactions preventing widespread resistance? Resistance to sylvatic plague (caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis) has been observed in prairie dogs (genus Cynomys) in six western states, but resistance is still rare. This project integrates genomic and transcriptomic analysis of experimentally infected animals with rangewide spatiotemporal sampling to elucidate how, when and where resistance evolves, and what prevents this adaptive trait from sweeping to fixation. Previous experimental infections and a natural epizootic will be used to determine the genomic basis of resistance in two species. Alleles associated with resistance, along with neutral alleles serving as a null model, will be genotyped in latitudinal transects spanning populations with different plague introduction times, and in museum specimens from at least three distinct time ranges. These data will enable estimates of the rate of evolution of resistance alleles and inferences of the landscape spatial structure and genomic characteristics facilitating resistance. Understanding how adaptation persists across space and time can enable facilitated adaptation in imperiled systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, there are approximately 250,000 women living with ovarian cancer in the U.S., and ovarian cancer has more than a 70% chance to recur. The proposed technology may provide early detection of the ovarian cancer and monitoring functions to improve the survival rate and save thousands of women lives.  In addition, the proposed diagnostic platform may be expanded to detect many other diseases, such as other cancers, malaria, and Covid-19, at commercial diagnostic laboratories.

The proposed technology initially will be used to test for ovarian cancer, and works by quantifying the concentrations of various biomarkers for ovarian cancer at an extremely low limit of detection (pico-level). It is a standalone device that consists of two main components: a microfluidic channel that is capable to separate the blood plasma spontaneously in the capillary blood flow, and a biosensing platform integrated with microchannels that contain multiple nano-biosensors used to detect various antigens at pico-level concentrations in the separated plasma.

The detection of issues during manufacturing is enabled by mm-Wave antenna sensors that can detect hidden process defects based on embedded metal and dielectric features in real time. One of the goals of this project is to overcome key manufacturing bottlenecks in high-density wiring substrates with several component integrations for advanced packaging. Another goal is to reduce, and perhaps, eliminate waste impact and carbon footprint on the environment via intelligent Additive Manufacturing. The proposed manufacturing path will generate new manufacturing tool business opportunities across the electronics supply chain. Upon successful completion of the project, the new sensing technology will be licensed. The project will also provide an ideal opportunity to prepare the next-generation workforce with strong technical and communication skills as well as experience in manufacturing challenges and market trends. <br/><br/>The proposed project will develop a unique, noncontact, real-time detection system for hidden manufacturing defects in electronics with the goal of achieving in-line process control for reproducibility, tolerance and yield, eventually leading to high-density electronics integration. This technology will be achieved through an innovative mm-Wave antenna array sensing system to reveal hidden metal-dielectric features through backscattering. Detection of spectra and amplitude shifts will be classified or mapped into defect categories through machine learning algorithms for real-time corrective actions. The advancement of antennas with smaller Radar Cross-Sections (RCS) has allowed the design of mm-Wave sensors with a broad impact in several areas, including 6G communications, healthcare, safety, and security products. In this PFI-TT project, the mm-Wave noncontact probing system will be integrated into production-scale 3D printing systems to achieve defect-free manufacturing by collaborating with a technology partner. The proposed mm-Wave sensing brings precision impedance-matched Radio Frequency (RF) interconnects and antennas, all coupled with advances in wiring design for active embedding. Further, continuous remote in-line monitoring for scalable high-volume manufacturing can lead to solutions for the self-healing of manufacturing defects.

The generated or collected data will be analyzed in each case using robust statistical models to achieve the project objectives, which will lead to potentially transformative technologies to improve long-term carbon storage in deep saline aquifers. Finally, this research project will increase public awareness and enhance scientific literacy around energy use and CO2 emissions for a diverse audience through public lectures, hands-on demonstrations, and other outreach programs.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Plants contain various types of functionally specialized vesicles that accumulate or transport specific proteins important for plant growth, development, and stress responses.  In Brassica plants (plants in the cabbage and mustard family), there are specialized vesicles called endoplasmic reticulum (ER) bodies that can generate toxic compounds upon tissue damage as a ?mustard oil bomb? against pathogens and herbivores. ER bodies and their associated chemical arsenal were thought to occur only in Brassica plants, but recent studies have shown that ER body-related vesicles are present in all plants. The functions of these vesicles are unknown. This project seeks to understand these ER body-related vesicles and how they contribute to the diversity of biological functions in plants. The Broader Impacts of this project include teaching and training students to conduct their own mini-research projects and the PI will also participate as a mentor for high school science fairs. <br/><br/>Vesicle-mediated protein trafficking between subcellular compartments is a basic process of cellular life.  Plants contain various types of functionally specialized, ER-derived vesicles (ERDVs) that accumulate or transport specific proteins important for plant growth, development, and stress pathways. In the highly conserved secretory pathway, ER-synthesized proteins fold and pass onto the Golgi apparatus through COPII-coated vesicles before transport to other subcellular compartments.  However, in plant cells, some specific ER-synthesized proteins pass into specialized ERDVs and are transported to other compartments in a Golgi-independent manner.  ER bodies in Brassica plants are specialized ERDVs that generate toxic chemicals against herbivores and pathogens. These ER bodies are found only in Brassica plants and their origins are unknown. NAI2 is an ER body protein with homologs only in Brassica and is required for ER body formation. Three related NAI2-interacting proteins (NAIP1 to 3) from Arabidopsis are also required for ER body formation but have homologs in all plants. While NAIP1 is specifically associated with ER bodies, NAIP2 and 3 are also associated with related ERDVs containing other proteins.  Thus, there is a novel family of ER body-related, NAIP-containing vesicles in all plants.  The goal of this project is to establish the functional diversity of the NAIP vesicles by identifying their cargo proteins, determining the regulatory roles of NAIP vesicles, and analyzing additional factors important for the biogenesis of NAIP vesicles. Progress of this project will enhance the understanding of the molecular basis of plant traits such as seed germination, vascular development, and plant defense, which has a multitude of applications, including those in the agricultural setting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Seasonal variations of sea level can be equivalent to sea-level rise that occurs over decades and can pre-dispose coastal regions to increased flooding from storm surge and tides. This project leverages recent developments in observations and computer models to address the following questions: How does the seasonal cycle in coastal sea level relate to that over the deep ocean? What physical mechanisms determine that relationship? How consistent are model and data representations of such seasonal variability? What factors can affect those representations? The specific objectives are to: (1) analyze the sea-level seasonal cycle, its mean and year-to-year  variability, and its spatial structure over the global ocean including its coastal zones, based on data and models; (2) understand the causes of the spatial and temporal variability in the seasonal cycle of sea level; (3) assess model-based estimates of the sea-level seasonal cycle against data and understand their differences in terms of possible model and data shortcomings. Satellite and in situ measurements of sea level, ocean bottom pressure, plus water temperature and salinity will be combined to determine the seasonal cycle in sea level and the relative contributions from changes in water density. Close scrutiny will be given to the spatial structure of seasonal sea level, the connections between deep and shallow coastal regions, and to the year-to-year variations related to climate variability. Observational results will be compared to available model-based estimates, and thus assess the ability of the latter to explain the observed spatial and temporal characteristics of the seasonal cycle in sea level. Discrepancies will be used to examine needed improvements in modeling and observing systems. Detailed examination will determine the effects of atmospherically forced versus ocean internal variability associated with eddies. The planned data and model analyses will lead to developing better tools for sea-level forecasts and projections, allowing for better preparation of coastal communities for flood risks.<br/><br/>This project seeks to study the seasonal variability in sea level over the global ocean and coastal regions. Specific objectives would be to a) analyze the seasonal cycle, its mean and year-to-year variability, as well as its spatial structure; b) diagnose the forcing and dynamics of the spatiotemporal variability in the sea-level seasonal cycle; and c) determine how well models and data assimilation systems represent these seasonal cycles and explore the causes for differences with the observations. These objectives would be addressed with altimetry, tide gauge, satellite gravity and in-situ temperature-salinity data, as well as with various model-based estimates from ECCO, GLORYS and OCCIPUT efforts. Analyses would allow separation of steric and manometric effects on the seasonal cycle. Emphasis would be placed in understanding differences between deep and shallow coastal areas and year-to-year variability related to climate. Efforts would also concentrate on determining the relative effects on the seasonal cycle of external atmospheric forcing vs intrinsic ocean variability associated with eddies and nonlinear processes. As broader impacts, detailed comparisons of data, models, and assimilation systems to be pursued under the project would lead to more informed requirements for data collection and model improvements and contribute towards developing better tools for SL forecasts and projections, allowing for better preparation of coastal communities for flood risks. This is aligned with major efforts of the World Climate Research Program in the theme of Regional Sea Level Change and Coastal Impacts. The collaborative proposal would involve researchers from France (Penduff, to analyze OCCIPUT) and Germany (Schindelegger, to analyze tide gauges and coastal altimetry data sets).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Glasses appear to be solid, but in contrast to crystals, they have amorphous structures that are more akin to liquids. Polymers, like plastics and rubbers, frequently form glassy solids. While they are ubiquitous in modern life, they still exhibit poorly understood behaviors. For example, they appear to be made up of small structural domains that slowly move through the seemingly solid material, oftentimes at different speeds. Professor Kaufmann and her students are watching the fluorescence from individual molecules embedded within polymers to track the movement of these domains. Their discoveries could inform the design of materials for use in a wide range of applications, from household goods to solar cells and biomedical materials. The students engaged in this research learn a broad range of experimental techniques and analysis approaches that are applicable to many areas of science and technology. The Kaufman group also regularly engages with K-12 students through talks and demonstrations that introduce students to the unusually interesting properties of glassy materials.<br/> <br/>Professor Kaufman will refine and extend single molecule imaging. The addition of complementary approaches is expected to provide for a more detailed view of dynamic heterogeneity in polymeric glass formers. Fluorescence signals detected from novel probes will be followed over time scales ranging from minutes to hours and used to characterize the length scale, organization, and mechanical properties of heterogeneous regions in glassy polystyrene. First, a set of experiments comparing the behavior of free and tethered single molecule probes in physically entangled and chemically cross-linked polymers will elucidate aspects of the spatial extent of heterogeneous domains. Following this, investigations into bulk and local mechanical properties in polystyrene below its glass transition temperature, including following perturbations, will be undertaken in this and similar systems. Using a modular approach, the Kaufman group will perform integrated imaging and rheology experiments to detail connections between bulk mechanical properties, local free volume, and spatiotemporally local dynamics in glasses.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed hardware, optics, and analytical algorithms may be readily integrated into a variety of geometries, such as flow cytometry and microscopy, enabling non-destructive assessment for rapid, label-free diagnostics and biomanufacturing process optimization. The inherent flexibility of the proposed technology enables non-destructive assessment for rapid, label-free biomanufacturing process optimization. In addition, a prototype has been engineered that was purpose-built to integrate with biomanufacturing workflows at reduced cost and footprint compared to commercial instruments.  Software also has been developed to detect functional biomarker changes at the cell level along with machine learning models that predict later cell function, neither of which are commercially available.

There is a critical need to develop educational materials and research around experiences emphasizing digital safety for elementary school students. The outcome of this project has the potential to greatly improve digital safety for children without restricting their learning opportunities. This project will also provide undergraduate and graduate students in computing and education majors with the opportunity to gain experience by involving them in the design of the educational materials as well as the evaluation and research activities. The implementation of security education for elementary school grades will promote modernization of digital safety educational materials and help elementary schools adapt to technology development and prepare responsible 21st century learners.<br/><br/>This project addresses the need for digital safety and privacy education at the elementary school level. To accomplish this goal the project will design a comprehensive suite of digital safety educational materials for elementary school students in Grades 3-5. Topics will include cyberbullying,  digital security and privacy, footprint, and the correct way of communicating on the Internet. The materials will be disseminated to students by training 40 elementary school in-service and pre-service teachers through workshops in the greater Charlotte, North Carolina area. Week-long digital safety summer camps will reach 400 elementary school students  and will be used to conduct thorough evaluation and improvement of the educational materials. The project will also engage parents through a Parent workshop and will explore the formation of a Student-Parent-Teacher-Researcher coalition for future digital safety education.

The research and public service will be conducted at the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution (WHOI). Subduction zones play a critical role in global geochemical cycles, especially for volatile elements such as hydrogen, carbon, sulfur, chlorine, and nitrogen (N) that largely return to the surface through volcanic degassing. While nitrogen is the most abundant gas in Earth?s atmosphere, the extent to which it can return to the deep mantle through subduction and, the factors that control deep N sequestration, remain unknown. For this project, the researcher will 1) quantify nitrogen outputs from dozens of volcanoes in the Central America Volcanic Arc (CAVA) and the Southern Volcanic Zone (SVZ) of the Chilean Andes, and 2) identify the sources of N in arc magmas. This work involves determining N concentrations and isotope ratios in small inclusions of fluids that are trapped in crystals before N has been degassed to Earth?s surface. During his tenure at WHOI, the PI will partner with New Heights Charter School (Grades 6-12) in Brockton, MA to develop teaching materials and demonstrations related to subduction and volcanism that can be directly incorporated into the Massachusetts state standards for physical sciences. He will also mentor summer undergraduate students through the REU program at WHOI.<br/><br/>Volatile recycling through subduction zones and volcanic arcs modifies Earth?s atmospheric composition and helps to maintain a stable climate and a habitable planet over geologic time. However, a global perspective on the deep N cycle is only beginning to emerge. Whether the mantle is a net source (via volcanism) or a net sink (via subduction) of N remains a subject of debate and may be largely governed by the thermal evolution of the subducting slab. The researcher will use samples that in hand to produce two comprehensive, along-arc N and ?15N data sets, examining fluid inclusions in mineral separates from mafic arc lavas along the CAVA and the SVZ. Because these systems are thermally similar but have distinct N sources and subduction dynamics, these data allow for the isolation of geologic controls on N recycling through subduction zones and volcanic arcs. Ratios of N2/3He and N2/Ar will constrain N fluxes along these arc segments while ?15N will allow for source discrimination. This project leverages the unique analytical capacity of a Nu Noblesse HR noble gas mass spectrometer connected to a dedicated sample crushing and N purification line at WHOI, avoiding sample contamination from the modern atmosphere, and providing the highest precision subduction zone N data currently available.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some of these noncoding regions are transcribed to produce long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are processed similarly to protein-encoding messenger RNAs. Although they are often found only at low amounts within a cell, lncRNAs have been implicated in a myriad of biological processes including cell growth and survival, cell identity and environmental interactions, as well as numerous human and animal diseases. The next frontier will be to tap into the biotechnology potentially inherent to these lncRNAs. This project will use a synthetic, ?understanding by building? approach to rationally design and use lncRNAs to control large swaths of chromosomal DNA. Broad utility will be demonstrated by using this new RNA technology in human cells and in yeast (fungi). Engineering lncRNAs to control their activity will not only contribute to fundamental understanding of these enigmatic RNAs, but also tap the vast potential to generate useful biomolecules in agricultural and medical applications across species. The project includes uniquely tailored programming to support STEM workforce development for participants ranging from high school students to postdoctoral fellows. New virtual and hands-on activities focused on RNA biology will be integrated with successful STEM outreach programs to ensure strong impact.<br/><br/>This project seeks to define the minimal features that are required for large-scale silencing mediated by lncRNA, building off of the well-characterized Xic locus and its associated lncRNA, Xist, which is responsible for silencing one of the X chromosomes in female mammals and marsupials. The ultimate goal is to gain fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which lncRNAs can exert silencing effects at a chromosomal scale despite being expressed at a low level in the cell. To tackle this, the investigators will first test the effects of different repeats on silencing ability in a mammalian cell culture system. They will then attempt to silence autosomal loci by integrating synthetic lncRNAs into other chromosomes, or via CRISPR-based targeting. We will use these data to parameterize mathematical models to better understand the dynamics and limitations of the silencing process. They will also create a stand-alone silencing system in haploid yeast cells using components of the Xist system. This will enable detailed genetic manipulations to further test and optimize the silencing system using the power of yeast genetics. Finally, the project will use the data to guide rational design of synthetic silencing systems that can be readily deployed in mammalian cells to achieve targeted and tunable silencing. Overall, the investigators expect to push the boundaries of the current understanding of lncRNA functions in the nucleus, with anticipated outcomes to include defining the minimal components and lncRNA levels required for stable and specific epigenetic regulation. By reconstituting functional components from the ground-up, they expect to validate, challenge, and/or expand fundamental mechanics involving RNAs. Given that tunable lncRNA modulation could be a broadly applicable biotechnology, this work has exciting implications for bioengineering.<br/><br/>This collaborative project resulted from an NSF-sponsored Ideas Lab.

It is imperative to increase the energy efficiency of computing million-fold, according to the 2021 Semiconductor Research Corporation decadal plan. A compelling solution is to make semiconductor devices more capable, i.e., multifunctional. A material with a bandgap does not necessarily make it a semiconductor until there are impurity ions, namely dopants, to tune its electrical conductance and other properties. Mobilizing the dopant ions in semiconductors opens a window with nearly infinite opportunities. It is likely that future semiconductors will be dynamically reconfigurable on the fly with atomic precision at record-low attoJoule (10-18 Joule) energy level, which resembles but outperforms biological synaptic systems. This grant is to forge a team for developing a simulation and AI guided co-design framework for attoJoule semiconductor materials with atomic precision, multifunctional devices, and smart systems for future ultralow-power computing and memory, thereby realizing a sustainable society with ubiquitous AI.

Key innovations include: (1) Protonic electrochemical ionic synapse that is deterministic and achieves high-speed switching with attoJoule energy consumption; (2) In-sensor computing systems to process images without external power supply at Edge; (3) Synaptic material-device-system co-design guided by first principles-based multiscale simulation and AI, thus providing a generalizable rational co-design framework for the future of semiconductors (FuSe). The underlying software suite is developed into a CyberFuse training module that is accessible through a CyberFuSe portal. The training modules are piloted in classrooms to support a dual-degree program (Ph.D. in physics, materials science or electrical engineering with MS in computer science or AI) and taught in CyberFuse training workshops.

These manufacturers are generally considered to be untrusted, driving concerns of intellectual property (IP) piracy and theft. Logic obfuscation, also called logic locking, was developed to mitigate these threats, however, its effectiveness varies widely based on how obfuscation resources are allocated throughout a system. This project studies how to model, automate, and evaluate the high-level configuration of logic obfuscation in a system to maximize security with minimal design overhead. The project's novelties are the system-wide view of the obfuscation resource allocation problem and the framework to generate mathematical models for this allocation problem. The purpose of these models is to automatically identify effective distributions of budgeted obfuscation resources in varied computer chips and provide intuition on how obfuscation secures a complex system. The project's broader significance and importance are in lowering the barrier to developing secure computer chips for high-trust applications (e.g., healthcare, defense, finance, and automotive) through automation. The integration of education and research is a key objective. This includes research opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students as well as open-source course modules to train next-generation security experts for the workforce.<br/> <br/>This project bridges the knowledge gap between combinational, gate-level logic obfuscation schemes and their security impact in the larger integrated circuit they protect. Specifically, the project develops a design space modeling framework for logic obfuscation system configuration in order to budget obfuscation resources, allocate resources to design regions, and specify obfuscation schemes in these regions. Given a fixed budget of various obfuscation resources, these models automatically identify obfuscation configurations that fulfill system-wide security goals with minimal design overhead. The research artifacts are 1) quantifiable system security metrics for obfuscation, 2) an open-source design space modeling framework for obfuscation, and 3) a verification of generated models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Nevertheless, developing reliable distributed systems is challenging due to the need to contend with concurrency across machines, concurrency within each machine, unreliable networks that can delay or drop messages, and  partial failures if one or more machines crash and reboot while others continue running.  As a result, distributed systems are error-prone and subtle bugs can lead to significant outages.  Traditional testing approaches are insufficient to eliminate all such bugs.  This project's novelty is a new approach to formal verification of distributed systems that allows verifying components in a modular fashion.  It allows for verification of distributed systems in the presence of crashes. This project's impact is intended to include improving the reliability and correctness of distributed systems and avoid costly outages. In addition, new lab assignments for systems-verification classes are being developed, focused on distributed systems.<br/><br/>The technical approach addresses two specific challenges: reasoning about crash recovery in distributed systems, as well as composing distributed systems from smaller components.  Crash recovery is challenging because individual nodes can crash and reboot.  Once a node starts running again, it might no longer be consistent with the rest of the system that did not crash. This means the node may have lost all of its memory contents on crash but may have kept some state durably on disk.  The second challenge lies in composing specifications and proofs of distributed systems (such as a key-value store) that are built out of smaller components (such as a configuration service, a lock service, or the implementation of an individual node).  Scaling verification of distributed systems requires the proof to reflect this modularity.  For example, reasoning about an application that uses a lock service should not require reasoning about the network messages sent by the lock service itself.  It should be done purely using the specifications for the lock service client stubs. This project tackles these challenges using concurrent separation logic, which provides a natural approach for composing proofs about multiple components, as well as abstracting away implementation details with a pre/post-condition specification.  This project extends earlier work with techniques for distributed system reasoning, including new kinds of per-node invariants (which might need to be repaired on crash) as opposed to global invariants (which must hold even if some nodes have crashed).  In addition, the project provides techniques for reasoning about exactly-once semantics of Remote Procedure Calls (RPC) on top of unreliable computer networks and locks that span multiple machines.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As the semiconductor technology scaling predicted by Moore?s law slows down, domain-specific hardware accelerators, i.e., hardware blocks specialized to do certain tasks very well, will play an increasingly important role in improving the performance and energy-efficiency of computing systems. Modern mobile chips have dozens of accelerators for applications such as image processing, video coding, graphics, neural networks etc. to achieve low power consumption and fast processing speeds. However, with advances in machine learning, these applications are changing at a rapid pace. Maintaining high performance and energy-efficiency requires that hardware accelerators, compilers, and applications evolve together in lockstep. Unfortunately, existing methodologies to achieve this involve significant manual effort. Large engineering teams study the accelerator architecture in detail and modify the compiler in an ad hoc manner, leveraging low-level libraries to target specific hardware features. Because of the large overhead in maintaining the software stack, it remains challenging to accelerate new domains or existing domains as they evolve. What is needed is a structured approach for generating programmable accelerators and for updating the software compiler as the accelerator architecture evolves with the applications. This project proposes a design-space exploration and optimization framework that automatically generates accelerator architectures that approach the efficiencies of hand-designed ones, with a significantly lower design effort for both hardware and compiler generation. This work can impact how hardware-software system design is done today in the industry, by reducing the time to market for products and creating more productive design teams. Moreover, the openly shared curriculum developed as a part of this work will ensure equitable access to educational opportunities and help create a diverse, globally competitive semiconductor workforce. <br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to create a framework for automated co-design and optimization of domain-specific hardware accelerators and compilers. The framework will have three components: (1) an automated accelerator processing element (PE) design space optimization tool based on frequent subgraph mining and merging, (2) an accelerator memory element optimization tool for both dense and sparse applications, and (3) an auto-scheduler for automatically determining the best mapping of an application to the accelerator. These tools will be used to design, optimize and prototype in silicon a unified programmable accelerator for both dense application domains such as image processing and machine learning and sparse application domains such as graph analytics, and demonstrate energy-efficiency and performance metrics that significantly beat general purpose architectures and approach application-specific integrated circuits. The proposed approach uses several techniques, distinct from prior work, to achieve automatic accelerator-compiler co-design and optimization. First, it allows any change in the hardware specification to automatically propagate into the compiler with no manual effort. This unique property is the key to enabling large-scale design space exploration of accelerators. Without it, one would have to manually update the application compiler with every hardware change, greatly limiting the number of design points one can explore. Second, the proposed framework for automated PE optimization for accelerators generates efficient PE architectures from the application graphs themselves, using frequent subgraph mining and merging. This approach is quite different from prior work, which does not perform application-driven optimization but rather searches over many possible PE parameter values. As a result, this approach promises to be much more sample-efficient and faster versus prior work. Finally, as opposed to existing commercial high level synthesis tools and compilers for programmable accelerators which require the user to provide low-level scheduling directives in the application code, the auto-scheduler proposed will automatically search for the best mapping of an application to the programmable accelerator, greatly improving user productivity.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, governments and NGOs have long understood that expanding access to healthcare and education in underserved communities requires poorer citizens to avail themselves of public programs.  In the wake of the pandemic, the question of how states can elicit individual behavioral change has taken on pressing significance for policy-makers and practitioners in the United States and beyond.  Through an experimental examination of how messages from state actors shape participation in government health and education benefits, this project will directly inform efforts to implement initiatives which rely on pro-developmental actions from citizens.<br/> <br/>The project explores how citizen relationships with and perceptions of particular state actors shape the success of these actors in motivating pro-developmental behaviors.  It posits that this success will vary according to (1) whether state actors operate at the state or local level, (2) whether they are elected officials or appointed administrators, and (3) whether they are women or men.  In addition, the project contends that citizens who share political preferences and demographic traits with particular state actors will be more likely to trust their calls for behavioral change.  To test these arguments, the project implements two related Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs), focusing on two policy areas ? health and education. The health portion explores the choice by lower-income citizens to sign up for health insurance, while the education portion looks at parent willingness to enroll girls in school. The RCTs comprise two waves of survey experiments delivered to a randomized selection of approximately 2,000 lower-income citizens.  In the first wave, messages encouraging pro-developmental behavior in education and health ? and randomized as coming from different types of state actors -- will be delivered in-person.  The same messages will then be delivered over two months to respondent mobile devices, after which the second wave will measure whether respondents have indeed engaged in the recommended pro-developmental action. The findings will allow an assessment of whether, and under what conditions, state actors can influence citizens to adopt pro-developmental behaviors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The PIs include the Space group at North Carolina State University, the  Zaworotko group in Ireland and the James group in Northern Ireland. The tripartite team seeks to produce superior water sorption materials to address a variety of pressing national and world needs. For example, access to fresh water typically occurs from sources such as lakes, rivers, precipitation, glaciers and groundwater. Unfortunately, conventional water sources are unevenly distributed and, according to the United Nations, by 2025, two out of three people worldwide will be living in a territory facing a freshwater crisis. Thus, atmospheric water harvesting and dehumidification are the focus problems. Whereas only 0.04% of water exists as atmospheric water, this represents a vast quantity (about 1.29 x 10^16 liters!) and is infinitely renewable. Further, humidity control is critically important for industries such as food production, pharmaceuticals, chemical processing and petroleum refining. Current technologies for dehumidification are energy intensive, using as much as 50% of the energy footprint of air handling systems and consuming 5-10% of global energy production. Driven by insights provided by modeling, the Space group will lead the team to produce transformative materials with our experimental partners to address the need for plentiful fresh, water that is renewable, widely available and inexpensive.<br/><br/>Specifically, the activities focus on materials discovery and design via an iterative cooperative approach.

The diverse project will provide educational training spanning theoretical modeling, materials synthesis and the design of systems for practical water harvesting. Students will interact across disciplines and locations developing a powerful skill set for future impactful work in the age of tailor-made materials for grand challenge problems. The aim is to produce and employ modeling that will usefully guide synthetic materials chemists, using the power of high quality, reliable molecular modeling. Simulations, synthesis and materials evaluation are needed to jointly address sorbent material performance under different conditions. Rational insights will be sought into controlling, harvesting and manipulating water in porous materials via our experimental / theoretical team, supporting human flourishing on a global scale.<br/><br/><br/>TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems contribute funds to this award, which supports the AQUASORB research team taking an innovative approach to the discovery and development of materials for capturing water. The PIs include the Space group at North Carolina State University, the Zaworotko group in Ireland and the James group in Northern Ireland. The development of energy efficient approaches for water harvesting is a global challenge because of its critical relevance to three key sectors: atmospheric water harvesting, dehumidification and farming.<br/><br/>The Problem to be Addressed by AQUASORB: Whereas solid desiccants enable several current technologies for water capture, they suffer from two major drawbacks: (i) High energy footprint: Water capture is not in itself a challenge as there are many inexpensive desiccants that readily capture water, even at low relative humidity. The subsequent release of water is a different matter. This is because most effective commercial sorbents work too well; their regeneration generally requires heating at high temperatures, well above the boiling point of water. (ii) Poor performance at low relative humidity: The most widely used commercially available desiccants such as commercial silica, have a relatively low (but still high) energy footprint and tend to perform much less effectively at low humidity. Despite finding utility in commercial dehumidification applications, such desiccants are unsuited for water harvesting applications where most needed, i.e arid regions. These factors render the current generation of desiccants commercially unsuitable or expensive for water harvesting because of their high energy costs and the resulting high carbon footprints.<br/><br/>The solution: AQUASORB ? a Tripartite Medley of Modeling and Experiment ? A Virtuous Cycle of Materials Discovery. The team will take an innovative approach to the discovery and development of the next generation of regeneration optimized desiccants. Given the context above, it is unsurprising that there is high interest in the development of new energy efficient liquid and solid desiccants. Currently, the number of reported desiccants in these respective fields is enormous, and growing. In essence, the number of potential desiccants is growing exponentially but the experimental screening of these desiccants is time?consuming and expensive. AQUASORB will address this challenge by exploiting the expertise of the groups of Zaworotko (University of Limerick, desiccant synthesis, and characterization), James (Queen?s University Belfast, porous liquid application of desiccants) and Space (North Carolina State University, materials modeling and design) to develop a predictive approach to identify new desiccants with regeneration optimized capture/release performance. These desiccants will capture and release atmospheric water with high working capacity, low energy of desorption and fast kinetics by having just the right level of water binding ? not too strong and not too weak. AQUASORB?s ultimate objective is two-fold: (i) to advance the science of water sorption modeling in order to (ii) identify desiccants that capture water vapor under ambient conditions and release that water with a low energy footprint. Meeting these requirements will enable disruptive new water harvesting technologies.<br/><br/>The Space group leads in modeling interfaces and porous materials with a track record of innovation over two decades and will lead the team via materials modeling and design. The project leverages expertise in simulations, evolved through productive working relationships with our experimental partners, to tackle water sorption materials. This includes the substantial challenge of adding water to our force field such that its behavior in a variety of porous solids is reliably described. We have expanded our extensive collaboration on porous materials with the Zaworotko Group at the University of Limerick to include porous liquids with the James group at Queens University Belfast seeking to understand water in complex materials that will lead to practical solutions for people. Insights to control the subtle balance between water sorption energetics and entropics when ordered within a structure will be pursued. Accurately capturing water structure in complex environments and abstracting its essential behavior is a master challenge ideally suited to the strengths of our productive experimental / theoretical AQUASORB partnership. The resulting force field and modeling innovations will be shared with the scientific community including making our codes widely available while incorporating them into commonly used programs. Iterative team materials design and evaluation will be pursued with experimental synthesis and characterization fueled by advanced modeling.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

ENSO is expressed as changes in tropical Pacific sea surface temperatures, and it impacts natural and human systems across the globe. Whether ENSO events will become stronger in the future is unclear, in part because the processes that control ENSO are not fully understood. Past ENSO activity can be reconstructed using geochemical proxy evidence from ocean sediments from the eastern equatorial Pacific. The last warm climate period, known as Marine Isotope Stage 5e (MIS 5e), occurred ~119,000-126,000 years ago. Thus, Eastern Pacific sediments from MIS 5e record ENSO behavior during a previous warm state. This research will characterize MIS 5e sediments in an eastern equatorial Pacific sediment core using the shell chemistry of foraminifera. These new records will provide reliable age control for the sediment core. The data from this core can then be compared with paleoclimate data from other locations. The study will support outreach efforts to broaden participation in STEM and in the geosciences through meaningful undergraduate research opportunities. Undergraduate research assistants will be involved in all phases of the project. The geochemical analyses will be a key component of a summer workshop for undergraduates. This will give the students valuable experience on modern analytical techniques. <br/><br/>ENSO?s behavior in response to elevated atmospheric carbon dioxide is not well constrained as our understanding of the mechanisms controlling tropical Pacific variability is incomplete. Reconstructions of ENSO during previous warm periods, and in particular the last interglacial (MIS 5e) are limited. Such reconstructions would enable testing of ENSO?s relationship with changing climate background conditions, orbital forcing, and seasonal changes in the absence of modern carbon dioxide forcing. The eastern equatorial Pacific cold tongue region is a center-of-action for ENSO, but sediment cores with adequate material, resolution, and characteristic are sparse. This research will generate a stable isotope and trace elemental stratigraphy using surface and subsurface foraminifera to identify and characterize MIS 5e sediments in an eastern equatorial Pacific sediment core.

To avoid confusion, and to communicate properly with any particular person, children must be able to perceptually segregate multiple talking faces and voices. To do so, they must identify and select corresponding face-voice pairs and then bind them into unitary and integrated audiovisual entities. Selective/sustained attention plays a critical role in the perceptual segregation process because it helps us identify and select corresponding faces and voices prior to binding them. This project investigates the development of selective/sustained attention to socially relevant audiovisual information and its impact on perception, learning, and memory in typically developing 4-, 5-, and 6-year-old children. The results from this project will provide critical insights into perception, attention, learning, and memory in typically developing young children and will suggest new ways to maximize their acquisition of critical cognitive skills essential for subsequent success in school and beyond. In addition, the results will provide new insights into the root causes of some learning disabilities that are known to involve impaired attention to and binding of auditory and visual information and will provide an evidence-based approach for detecting such disabilities and improving affected children?s cognitive and social development.<br/><br/>Selective/sustained attention emerges gradually during infancy and early childhood and it is the critical gateway to perception, learning, memory, and social responsiveness. This project investigates the development of selective/sustained attention in 4-, 5-, and 6-year-old children to talking faces and their accompanying voices in the service of perceptual segregation. The project seeks to answer three principal questions. First, how well do young children rely on selective/sustained attention to identify and bind audiovisually related information normally available in their typically cluttered multisensory environment and does this ability improve with development? Second, what underlying perceptual mechanisms make the developmental improvement in selective/sustained attention to multisensory information possible? Third, how does specific early experience (e.g., exposure to multiple languages or to different-race faces) affect the growth of selective/sustained attention? To investigate selective/sustained attention, we will rely on eye tracking to measure eye gaze while children perform various experimental tasks that require them to perceptually search a cluttered audiovisual scene, to perform audio-visual transfer, to exercise their executive control skills, and to learn and remember specific audiovisually integrated events. The findings from this project will provide novel insights into the emergence of attention and learning in early childhood, suggest empirically-based ways to maximize attention and learning in typically developing children, and will provide an evidence-based method for improving attention and learning in children at risk for early learning disabilities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The proposed implantable sensor platform measures a wide range of health biomarkers such as temperature, oxygen, glucose, pregnancy hormones, and lactate without the expensive of drawing blood or other bodily fluids. Morbidity and mortality rates of animals in feedlots range between 15% - 45% with Bovine Respiratory Disease (BRD) alone having an economic burden of $1 billion. In addition, the proposed technology has the potential to lower the use of antibiotics and medications used with feed animals by predicting illness days before conventional methods. The system uses a low-cost passive sensor implant that offers a significantly lower cost solution than alternative active electronic wearable devices.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a luminescent hydrogel implant that is the size of a grain of rice and an instrumentation system for data collection that is able to ?read? the implant.  The biosensor is implanted under the animal?s hide just a few millimeters below the tissue surface.  The implant device is seeded with a molecule that lights up when attached to a target biomarker such as oxygen and excited with light of a certain wavelength.  The reading instrument, similar in size to a metal detector, produces the excitation light and measures the emission return light signal from the implant.  Similar implantable biosensors that use skin-attached reading instruments are commercially available in the market and are approved by regulators for continuously measuring oxygen in humans.  Unlike human applications that use a skin attached reader, the proposed technology uses a rugged outdoor system for beef and dairy applications to read the implant sensor at a distance of few centimeters several times a day for early detection of illness.

Graduate students play a critical role in early undergraduate mathematics, serving as teaching assistants and lead instructors for a substantive proportion of first- and second-year courses at many institutions. Recognizing that most beginning graduate students do not have prior experience as educators, many departments now provide Professional Development for Teaching (PDT) for graduate student instructors in mathematics. The specifics of PDT programs can vary across institutions, and is often tailored to local factors including the students being served in early courses.  To sustain and improve these programs, however, departments and administrators must be able to assess their effectiveness and engage in continuous improvement efforts. The Program Assessment Conference for Mathematics will foster a partnership among those who implement, those who oversee, and those who evaluate the professional development of mathematics graduate students. This project will work toward the creation of a flexible assessment tool. Sustainable programs are ones who understand and can share their stories of impact and improvement, and the project-created protocol will empower mathematics departments to self-assess their professional development programs for graduate students. A high-quality tool will not only improve undergraduate education, but will also propagate improvement to other campuses because many graduate students are future faculty.<br/><br/>In order to develop and refine the protocol, the workshop will take part in two phases.  Drawing from a participants' expertise, the design phase of the workshop, which will be in-person, will elicit significant insights that lead to the creation of the protocol. Then, the (primarily virtual) testing and improvement phase will pilot the PAC-Math protocol in six higher education settings, improve the protocol based on feedback, and disseminate it to the mathematics community. Approximately half of the testing and improvement phase participants will be selected from the experts involved in the design phase. The remaining testing and implementation participants will not have been involved in the design of the protocol in order to build on new perspectives and ideas for improvement. Once the protocol has been piloted and revised, it will be disseminated widely to the mathematics community and will be potentially scalable to other disciplines and contexts in the future.

These biomarkers will be detected by binding to light-emitting nanoparticles, called Quantum Dots (QDs), that serve as a bright tag. By designing QDs to be easily distinguished from each other, the research team envisions the capability to detect as many as 45 different biomarkers in a single blood droplet. Biomarker detection will be performed on engineered surfaces called ?photonic crystals? (PCs) that are able to amplify the QD brightness by several thousand-fold, allowing QDs to be counted individually. The PCs also serve to direct the QD light output in specific directions that are measured to tell the difference between each type of QD. In addition, new approaches will be developed that can rapidly convert each biomarker molecule into many QDs on the PC surface. By combining PCs and QDs, the sensor can be simple, fast, and inexpensive, enabling biomarker tests to be performed in places like clinics and hospitals. The Team will develop a broadly accessible short course entitled ?What?s in Your Blood? Genomics Testing and You,? to be offered through the Osher Lifelong Learning Institute.  Aspects of the course will be adapted for public-facing programs offered through the Woese Institute for Genomic Biology and an interactive display at ?World of Genomics? events that are offered annually at large science museums.<br/><br/>Ultrasensitive, ultraselective, and highly multiplexed detection of biomolecules within complex media is a central component of disease diagnostics, life science research, and environmental monitoring.  New ?digital resolution? biomolecular detection methods are leading toward unprecedented detection limits, but are hindered by complex procedures, thermal cycling, and stringent sample preparation. Recent advances in the capability for photonic metamaterial surfaces to substantially amplify the collected photon output from semiconductor quantum dots are making assays with digital molecule precision compatible with small, low cost instruments. Applying QD tags with photonic crystal fluorescence amplification makes it possible to digitally count target molecules and to perform multiplexing through the ability to distinguish QD emission wavelengths by their outcoupled emission pattern. As a result, single-step, room temperature, enzyme-free assays for microRNA with attomolar-level detection limits and >6 log(10) orders of dynamic range can be achieved, with the potential to extend even further. In this project, the Cunningham and Smith labs will design and synthesize novel QD tags that incorporate engineered multispectral brightness, encodable emission saturation, and encodable PC enhancement factor. The QDs will specifically couple with photonic metamaterial surfaces to enhance their excitation, to modulate their lifetime, and to extract their emission to differentiate up to 45 distinct QD labels for molecular multiplexing. Finally, the team will introduce a new paradigm for biomolecule detection in which each target molecule can generate multiple downstream digital-resolution QD detection events to achieve ultrasensitive detection limits with simple and rapid methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ensuring cloud software runs continuously without disruptions is both vital and challenging. Decades of research have developed mature techniques to detect and mask faults in distributed systems. But these techniques often use a simple model that assumes a system component either works or completely stops. Numerous real-world cloud incidents, however, suggest that production cloud systems frequently experience gray failures---a degraded operational mode in which a system component appears to be working but is in fact severely impaired. Gray failures cannot be effectively dealt with by current solutions. The overall objective of this proposal is to develop a holistic approach to detect, pinpoint and diagnose gray failures in production cloud systems. <br/><br/>To realize the objective, four synergistic research activities are proposed. Specifically, the project conducts a study on real-world gray failure cases in popular distributed systems, measure and characterize the observability of existing systems. The project then designs a novel hybrid analysis that automatically inserts report-generation hooks across the whole systems stack to harness observability for detecting gray failures. To pinpoint the culprit component, this project further proposes algorithms to infer causality from the collected observations. Lastly, this project designs a runtime checking framework for increasing observability and online diagnosis of gray failures. <br/><br/>Gray failures are a common cause of cloud service outages, resulting in significant financial loss. This project can effectively improve our understandings of gray failures and help detect and debug gray failures to reduce their impact on the ubiquitous cloud infrastructures. Software is moving to be more distributed with increasing subtle failure modes. Observability, fault detection, and localization are critical skills for this paradigm shift but are rarely covered in the existing curriculum. This project addresses this educational gap through curriculum development and student training. This project also promotes Computer Science education to underrepresented Baltimore high school students by organizing workshops in partnership with a non-profit organization, Code in the Schools, for local high school students to showcase cloud and system failure concepts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

As such, they are ubiquitous in the mathematical modelling of a host of systems in physics, engineering, and other scientific fields. This project will explore two salient issues related to the theory of partial differential equations, in the setting of higher-dimensional spaces defined via complex numbers. The first topic is the question of unique continuation, which ? in rough terms ? asks when infinitesimal data about the solution to a differential equation suffices to determine the behavior of the solution on macroscopic scale. The second topic is the regularity of solutions. In many physically relevant situations, partial differential equations exhibit a self-improving regularity property: solutions that are a priori assumed to exist within a broad class of functions with a weakly defined notion of smoothness, in fact can be shown a posteriori to satisfy a much more stringent smoothness condition. Such results are important both for the theory of partial differential equations and for scientific applications. The types of second order partial differential equations under consideration in this project are relevant for other equations of physical significance, such as the wave and heat equations, the Klein-Gordon equation, Maxell?s equation, and Schrdinger?s equation. The project will also contribute to the development of a scientifically literate workforce through graduate recruitment and training.<br/><br/>The primary focus of the project is on the theory of CR mappings between CR manifolds. CR mappings are a foundational concept in the theory of several complex variables. In this context, a general unique continuation problem asks when a CR mapping between two embedded CR manifolds, that vanishes to infinite order at a single point, must vanish identically in a neighborhood of that point. Very few sufficient conditions are known, even in simple special cases. This question will be investigated in concert with related unique continuation problems for solutions of second order subelliptic partial differential equations with real analytic coefficients. The second part of the project involves the regularity theory of CR mappings on embeddable and abstract CR manifolds, along with the regularity of CR functions on abstract CR manifolds. Such results have applications to the theory of solutions of systems of first order complex nonlinear partial differential equations. The current project will focus on understanding conditions on the underlying manifolds that guarantee smoothness of CR mappings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The vessel?s route crosses the Mid Atlantic Bight (MAB) shelf and slope as well as the Gulf Stream and Sargasso Sea ? a diverse set of regions that bring together subpolar and tropical waters and critically influence ocean circulation, heat transport, biological productivity and the marine carbon cycle in the western North Atlantic. Measurements made from the ship include current velocity from Acoustic Doppler Current Profilers (ADCP) and temperature from expendable bathythermographs (XBTs) and thermosalinograph. The most recent vessel replacement, however, necessitated changes in the installations of the oceanographic instrumentation and subsequent reduction in data return from the ship-mounted ADCPs. This project is focused on resolving the instrument performance issues and returning the Oleander to routine return of oceanographic data.  Observations of partial pressure of carbon-dioxide (pCO2) are also made in-line with the theromosalinograph and there is a continuous plankton recorder for sampling plankton.<br/><br/>This project will bring the newest Oleander?s scientific sensors online, and to continue and enhance the in situ measurements made possible by this commercial vessel?s regular service along a single route. These measurements are essential for studies of ocean circulation, heat transport, biological productivity and the marine carbon cycle in the western North Atlantic. Interannual to decadal variability in the Gulf Stream system has both regional and basin-wide implications. Gulf Stream meandering impacts exchange processes with surrounding waters. In addition, climate models point to rapid change in the Atlantic Meridional Overturning Circulation (AMOC), whose warm limb is carried within the Gulf Stream, and suggest that AMOC variability also drives changes observed on the shelf and coast. To understand the underlying processes and to validate or refute the model-based hypotheses, there is a need for in situ multidecade records of the Gulf Stream and surrounding waters. The Oleander Line with its coverage of shelf, slope, Gulf Stream and Sargasso waters is well-suited to directly measure fluxes associated with the AMOC and to compare with AMOC estimates from other latitudes to examine meridional coherence. Increased understanding of the drivers of both the long-term changes and the event-scale processes on the shelf and slope off the Northeast US has implications for the phenology and health of the shelf ecosystems along the highly populated coast with commercially important fisheries.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematical sensemaking in science focuses on students? ability to blend core disciplinary science ideas with cross-cutting mathematical concepts, such as patterns and proportions, while engaging in scientific practices such as computational thinking, making predictions, and reasoning from evidence.  Current visions for undergraduate STEM education stress the need to integrate i) key disciplinary ideas and ii) crosscutting concepts with iii) authentic scientific practices, resulting in what is called three-dimensional learning. This requires developing new assessments with the ability to detect when students engage in three-dimensional learning and reveal this to instructors. This project seeks to extend previous work to identify opportunities to observe mathematical sensemaking in science in the classroom.  The project plans to develop open-ended questions to explore undergraduate mathematical sensemaking in science using three dimensional learning assessments. This serves the goal of improving STEM education at the undergraduate level by providing engaging and authentic assessments capable of revealing student thinking. Findings from this project should help inform teaching practice in undergraduate STEM courses and help students foster computational thinking skills. <br/><br/>The project will target two aims. Aim 1 is to apply an evidence-centered design process to develop open-ended assessment items that elicit mathematical sensemaking in science (MaSS) and align with a three-dimensional learning (3DL) assessment framework. The evidence-centered design approach for the assessments will provide an opportunity to collect validity evidence throughout the process and allow development of similar items across disciplines. Assessment tasks and coding rubrics will be based on frameworks for 3DL and MaSS, and will be iteratively revised to elicit and categorize student MaSS. The project will conduct interviews with undergraduates to examine their MaSS while completing the assessment items, and with college faculty to ensure alignment with disciplinary topics and phenomena common in college courses. Aim 2 is to administer constructed response items across undergraduate science disciplines to explore how undergraduates engage in MaSS across biology, chemistry, and physics. The project will administer the assessment items from Aim 1 at a diverse set of undergraduate institutions to collect student responses. These responses will be used to establish evidence of the validity, reliability, and fairness of the items quantitatively. Further, the responses will be used to explore how undergraduates engage in MaSS in varied science disciplines. The project meets the need for developing rich, formative assessment items for undergraduate 3DL that reveal student thinking, which is essential for instruction aimed to foster MaSS. The project will also advance understanding of how undergraduates integrate thinking about key STEM concepts and mathematics across disciplines by following a 3DL assessment framework.

However, the scalability of the technology remains to be evaluated. To this end, the objectives of this project are to: 1) deliver a pilot-scale bioprocess specifically tailored for the marine microorganism; 2) optimize the productivity of this bioprocess; and 3) assess the economic viability of the technology.

Fluid drag is an energy consumption barrier that must be continuously overcome by carriers transporting people and goods across the globe; thus, reducing fluid drag translates not only into more effective and viable transportation systems, but also in more ecofriendly ships. Increasing fluid slip at solid surfaces in contact with water is a potential drag-reduction mechanism. Surface engineering can be used to generate slip-surfaces; however, the fundamental mechanisms of slip in turbulent flows are not well understood. Therefore, the main objective of this project is to conduct a fundamental investigation into the mechanisms of hydrodynamic slip using a combination of sophisticated modeling techniques and experiments. This project will also create a general-public-oriented podcast where the investigators will present their findings to the public in a candid and accessible manner. Graduate and undergraduate students will be involved in the research and outreach activities of the project, where the promotion of equity and inclusion of underrepresented populations will be set as a mission.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to bridge the knowledge gap between experimental observations and numerical/theoretical calculations of hydrodynamic slip in high-shear rate flows. Similarly, through the combination of surface characterization techniques and numerical simulations at different length scales, the conceptual mismatch between the microscopic mechanisms of slip and macroscopic drag calculations will be addressed. To achieve these goals: (i) molecular dynamics simulations and theory will be used to create physics-informed models of solid-water interfaces able to calculate hydrodynamic slip and interfacial water structuring; (ii) sum frequency generation vibrational spectroscopy and atomic force microscopy will be used to validate not only the slip calculations, but also to verify the interfacial liquid property relation to slip calculations; and (iii) direct numerical simulations and wall modeled large eddy simulations will be used for the first time to model drag using physics-informed boundary conditions to further contribute to the design of engineered surfaces with low drag. The research output from this project will advance the fields of fluid dynamics and surface science, particularly in areas where drag reduction is paramount for the reduction of energy consumption.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Timely actions informed by early detection can reduce the spread of infection in a number of settings, such as schools, hospitals, nursing homes, and office buildings, thereby also reducing the costs of healthcare, absenteeism, and loss of productivity. The coronavirus pandemic is an obvious current target for early detection, given the severe consequences of infections among vulnerable populations and the continuous disruption to jobs and children?s education. However, many other airborne pathogens are of interest in similar settings, including common viruses such as the flu, and more rare viruses with severe consequences, such as tuberculosis and varicella. Timely actions that could be taken to reduce the spread of infection include isolation of exposed individuals, use of protective equipment, control of in-room ventilation, and space decontamination. More generally, occupants of spaces may be made aware through a phone app of the pathogen levels detected in areas of interest, so they can make informed decisions about what areas to visit and if masking may be advisable.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an integrated, automated, and portable device for sensing airborne pathogens on-site and in almost real-time. The process proposed consists of an initial collection step, in which virus particles are collected through electrostatic precipitation. Then, there is a detachment and RNA extraction step, followed by an enrichment phase. This technology is realized with a novel method that leverages the natural negative charge of RNA. Finally, the final steps are the chemical detection step and the classification step. The core innovation is not only the integration of the overall process described above, but also, the creation of a fieldable process that obtains highly concentrated target RNA from in-air viral particles. Pathogen detection from the air is substantially more challenging than detection from a patient swab due to the much lower in-air concentrations, those these concentrations can still infect people. The enrichment step is critical to be able to detect relevant in-air pathogen concentrations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Therefore, when should mom evolve to anticipate a change in the environment to best provision her offspring? This research will address this question by testing hypotheses regarding the ecological conditions that drive maternal offspring provisioning strategies. The work focuses on Trinidadian killifish, which exhibit maternal provisioning strategies that are easy to quantify. Additionally, killifish experience a wide range of ecological conditions. Finally, killifish are easy to manipulate, allowing for experimental tests of how natural selection influences offspring provisioning. Therefore, this research is well-positioned to provide new insights into how and why maternal provisioning strategies evolve. The work has broad implications for understanding the mechanisms by which organisms respond to environmental change. Further, it will improve researchers? ability to forecast how species respond to environmental stressors. The research goals will be combined with a plan for broader impacts that that uses killifish as a model to improve teaching, engage undergraduates from underrepresented groups in research at a Hispanic serving institution, and provide public outreach.<br/><br/>Much research has explored whether mothers respond to predictable shifts in environmental signals by modifying offspring phenotypes to best match future conditions. Yet, there is little evidence for the existence of such ?anticipatory maternal effects?. This shows that our understanding of the evolution of maternal effects is incomplete.  'Maternal condition transfer effects' represents an alternative to anticipatory effects that occur when the environment experienced by females during development influences offspring fitness. These effects are not driven by external signals but are instead a byproduct of past environmental quality. Condition transfer effects have received far less attention that anticipatory effects but are likely quite widespread. Interestingly, little work has considered the conditions that favor the evolution condition transfer vs. anticipatory effects. This project will use populations of killifish on the island of Trinidad to pursue three central goals. The research will: (1) determine if predator-mediated divergence in resource availability favors evolutionary shifts in maternal effects (i.e., condition transfer vs. anticipatory effects). (2) Test the connection between divergent natural selection, maternal condition, and offspring fitness via ?offspring outplant experiments?. (3) Experimentally evaluate the influence of resource availability on the evolution of maternal effects via long-term perturbations performed in natural streams.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Mathematical sensemaking in science focuses on students? ability to blend core disciplinary science ideas with cross-cutting mathematical concepts, such as patterns and proportions, while engaging in scientific practices such as computational thinking, making predictions, and reasoning from evidence.  Current visions for undergraduate STEM education stress the need to integrate i) key disciplinary ideas and ii) crosscutting concepts with iii) authentic scientific practices, resulting in what is called three-dimensional learning. This requires developing new assessments with the ability to detect when students engage in three-dimensional learning and reveal this to instructors. This project seeks to extend previous work to identify opportunities to observe mathematical sensemaking in science in the classroom.  The project plans to develop open-ended questions to explore undergraduate mathematical sensemaking in science using three dimensional learning assessments. This serves the goal of improving STEM education at the undergraduate level by providing engaging and authentic assessments capable of revealing student thinking. Findings from this project should help inform teaching practice in undergraduate STEM courses and help students foster computational thinking skills. <br/><br/>The project will target two aims. Aim 1 is to apply an evidence-centered design process to develop open-ended assessment items that elicit mathematical sensemaking in science (MaSS) and align with a three-dimensional learning (3DL) assessment framework. The evidence-centered design approach for the assessments will provide an opportunity to collect validity evidence throughout the process and allow development of similar items across disciplines. Assessment tasks and coding rubrics will be based on frameworks for 3DL and MaSS, and will be iteratively revised to elicit and categorize student MaSS. The project will conduct interviews with undergraduates to examine their MaSS while completing the assessment items, and with college faculty to ensure alignment with disciplinary topics and phenomena common in college courses. Aim 2 is to administer constructed response items across undergraduate science disciplines to explore how undergraduates engage in MaSS across biology, chemistry, and physics. The project will administer the assessment items from Aim 1 at a diverse set of undergraduate institutions to collect student responses. These responses will be used to establish evidence of the validity, reliability, and fairness of the items quantitatively. Further, the responses will be used to explore how undergraduates engage in MaSS in varied science disciplines. The project meets the need for developing rich, formative assessment items for undergraduate 3DL that reveal student thinking, which is essential for instruction aimed to foster MaSS. The project will also advance understanding of how undergraduates integrate thinking about key STEM concepts and mathematics across disciplines by following a 3DL assessment framework.

This Doctoral Dissertation Research project explores the biocultural pathways through which social, economic, and structural inequities are associated with stress and depression among parents with infants in an urban children?s hospital NICU. These pathways, through which the effects of biology and culture impact each other, provide key context for understanding how intersectional inequities, social support resources, and access to adequate healthcare mediate differences in wellbeing among NICU parents in the United States, who are already at high risk of poor outcomes. The results of this work are shared directly with hospital leaders, nursing staff, and social workers at the study?s hospital research site to contribute to discussions of how to reduce parental NICU-related stress and improve postpartum mental health outcomes. This project also supports undergraduate mentorship, interdisciplinary collaboration, and science engagement activities with the public. <br/><br/>Having an infant in intensive care is linked to higher rates of postpartum depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, and pregnancy-related morbidities due to the increased stress associated with adverse birth outcomes and stressful postpartum environments. This project uses a comparative mixed-methods approach including parental surveys, ethnographic observations and interviews, and infant medical record data to provide a more comprehensive view of the lived experiences of postpartum NICU parents. It explores how embodied NICU-related stress and mental health vulnerabilities are mediated through social and economic inequities that can affect adequate access to maternal postpartum healthcare and social support resources. To assess postpartum NICU-related stress, the project employs a self-reported NICU-specific stress scale that allows investigators to understand how key stressors associated with the physical and social NICU environment contribute to parental postpartum stress. Assessing the relationship between the sociocultural and economic environment, contextual-specific stressors, and mental implications for postpartum NICU parents is critical not only for the health of the parent but also for their infants during early development and the health of future pregnancies.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The explicit development of these skills (also known as transferable, process, 21st century, or soft skills) is of critical importance to prepare students for successful careers in science and technology.  Skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and communication have been identified as essential for a modern national workforce by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine as well reports from many industries and employers. These reports further identify that increased proficiency in student professional skills will ensure undergraduates a more successful launch as they begin their careers. In this project, a digital platform will be developed that leverages the Enhancing Learning by Improving Process Skills project, a novel and widely available feedback-based skills rubric. This project will provide strategies for instructors in classrooms of all sizes to help them develop and evaluate student professional skills. The digital platform and classroom strategies will also allow instructors to provide students with rapid feedback and effective coaching on how to improve their professional skills. This innovative project brings attention to the development of student professional skills as it will increase students? insights into the importance of these skills for scientists and advance their preparation for future STEM careers. <br/>     <br/>This project will help students develop and improve their professional skills in STEM classrooms by using a scalable digital platform based on novel feedback-based skill rubrics from the Enhancing Learning by Improving Process Skills project (ELIPSS.com). This project will conduct research on how feedback and self-assessment can help students improve their professional skills, as well as examine how external and tailored feedback can help students become self-regulated learners. The project team will design and pilot a digital platform to streamline assessment and actionable feedback delivery to students, using a multidisciplinary team of STEM instructors from a range of class sizes and institutional settings to ensure the application?s utility and adoptability. Through interviews and survey responses, instructional team members will identify optimum strategies for generating and delivering feedback to students that is both impactful and timely. Data will be collected on the ways in which students interact with the suggestions for improving skill development; these data will be analyzed to gauge how they responded to this feedback and whether it helped them improve their skills. Students will complete a validated science motivation questionnaire to collect their insights on how their development of professional skills may further motivate them towards STEM majors and careers. Five culminating goals and outcomes provide a framework for the execution of this project. First is the creation of a digital platform, which is preloaded with customizable professional skills rubrics that were a product of the NSF-funded ELIPSS project. Second, a team of instructors from a range of STEM disciplines and institutions across the country will implement and subsequently disseminate these materials. Third is the development of a set of materials and training protocols to train additional instructors to use the skill-building rubrics and digital platform. Fourth is the assembly of a collection of best instructional practices to optimize student interaction with feedback on their professional skill development. Fifth, and finally, is an advanced understanding of how these efforts impact students - promoting their skill development, their perception of the importance of these skill for scientists, and their preparation for future STEM careers. Overall, the broad scope of this project will enable greater integration of professional skill development into undergraduate STEM programs - the digital platform and classroom strategies are designed to be used in all disciplines, class sizes and institutional settings and will rapidly impact a large number of students. These students will enter the STEM workforce with key preparation in valued professional skills that will better ensure their success. Even more broadly, the tools and classroom strategies developed through this project will support the advancement of STEM education on multiple levels: they support active learning pedagogies, support skill-based programmatic assessment, and provide a data-collection mechanism for future education research. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students.

However, deploying them in the real world is challenging. The project?s novelties are the development of a next generation intrusion detection system that not only accurately identifies an intrusion but precisely diagnoses its root cause and method of attack, even in the presence of an attacker who actively tries to evade detection. The project?s broader significance and importance are (1) delivering timely solutions to real-world cybersecurity threats increasingly faced by both the U.S. government and large corporations that affect the security and privacy of millions, (2) fostering a collaborative security community by organizing a workshop on building and disseminating reproducible intrusion detection experiments, and (3) training first-generation and LGBTQ students to improve the representation of members from underrepresented groups in the security workforce.<br/><br/>The project addresses three challenges that imperil the efficacy and practical adoption of provenance-based intrusion detection systems. First, they cannot explain precisely the cause and progression of an attack. Second, they are ineffective when an attacker purposefully tries to evade them. Third, they require an abundance of provenance data that is difficult to obtain. To address these problems, this project designs a novel intrusion detection system that leverages machine learning to highlight anomalous computer activity indicating an intrusion. The machine learning algorithm focuses on making sense of the attack to reduce manual effort to triage intrusion alerts. To expose the shortcomings of existing intrusion detection systems, the project first studies new intrusion strategies that simultaneously attack a host computer system and evade detection. A counter measure technique that introduces randomness and strengthens robustness in learning is then incorporated into the machine learning pipeline to mitigate such attacks. Finally, the project leverages software engineering and program analysis techniques to synthesize benign provenance data to train the intrusion detection system and integrates these techniques into an automated framework to facilitate data generation. A successful project will advance state-of-the-art endpoint intrusion detection and response solutions, improve analyst experience, and enhance the security of cyberinfrastructure critical to the government and other organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The usefulness of such policy initiatives relies on their enforcement in practice. The enforcement strategy outlined in such regulations is similar to that used for software security compliance, wherein regulators delegate enforcement to Commercially Licensed Evaluation Facilities (CLEFs), which evaluate vendor products.  While such delegation is useful in scaling the enforcement to millions of products, it comes at a price: the affected party, i.e., the regulators and consumers who are the primary beneficiaries of security compliance, play a limited role in it, enabling an incentive structure skewed against effective enforcement. To elaborate, product vendors have little incentive to select an ideal CLEF that would thoroughly evaluate their product, instead of one that offers the fastest route to certification. Even if a vendor searched for an ideal CLEF in good faith, they have few means to gauge the CLEF?s effectiveness aside from brochures, limited demonstrations, and the CLEF?s reputation. Moreover, CLEFs are not licensed on the basis of their performance at detecting vulnerabilities, but instead on procedural competence (e.g., adequate facilities, personnel). Hence, traditional model, if applied as is to the IoT sector, would foster unvalidated CLEFs who have little incentive to improve, and vendors who simply view certifications as liability shields. This project seeks to avert such a future by empowering the affected party with practical tools to objectively measure the performance of CLEFs, and influence accountability in security compliance enforcement. The systematic, data-driven, evaluation techniques developed in this research will enable regulators and standards bodies to reform the compliance infrastructure by directly evaluating the claimed performance of CLEFs as a part of the license-granting process or periodic audits. Moreover, this research will also help CLEFs and vendors improve through self-evaluation, help vendors seek effective CLEFs, and help CLEFs compete on the basis of performance. By improving the compliance enforcement infrastructure for IoT, this project will generate tangible benefits for consumers in the form of secure IoT products, and has the potential to increase consumer confidence in and adoption of IoT technology. The research will be incorporated into graduate and undergraduate security classes at William & Mary through experiential learning activities, and disseminated to key stakeholders such as policymakers and developers, as well as the broader research community. <br/> <br/>This project synergistically blends the approach of mutation testing with static and dynamic analysis, machine learning, and qualitative studies, to lay the foundation for empirically and systematically evaluating CLEFs, along three core research thrusts and a fourth thrust that investigates extensibility. The first thrust examines if the scope of work assumed by CLEFs is sufficient, by investigating a key underlying question: what should CLEFs look for? To this end, the research acquires and analyzes IoT products at market-scale, in order to develop a generalizable understanding of what vulnerabilities are relevant to detect, i.e., pose risk in the IoT context, resulting in a comprehensive, risk-based IoT vulnerability taxonomy. The second thrust rigorously evaluates a CLEF?s ability to detect non-trivial variants of vulnerabilities from the taxonomy, i.e., mutants. It develops a threat-aware mutation framework that generates mutants guided by a threat model for compliance enforcement that encapsulates the conditions CLEFs must account for, thus ensuring a non-arbitrary evaluation of CLEFs. The third thrust re-imagines security analysis for compliance enforcement with the approach of mutation-driven vulnerability prediction, which combines the strengths of machine learning and security-focused mutation for effective detection. The fourth thrust explores the extensibility of the research to IoT product-types, application domains (e.g., smart cities), and usage paradigms. This research project leverages well-founded techniques from security, software engineering, and machine learning to make novel contributions at the intersection of security and software engineering. Finally, the initial focus on mobile-IoT apps as a target product-type will advance security research at the key intersection of mobile and IoT security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In principle, the location, composition, and properties of individual voxels and voxel-voxel interactions can be precisely defined to match the artistry of biological tissues. Realizing voxelated bioprinting would dramatically expand the capability of existing 3D bioprinting technologies, which largely rely on the assembly of one-dimensional (1D) bio-ink filaments. However, it remains a grand challenge to generate, deposit, and assemble individual droplets on-demand in 3D space. This project seeks to establish the foundational knowledge and to provide a new way of precisely manipulating viscoelastic droplets in 3D space. The knowledge and tools will make a positive impact on particle synthesis, encapsulation, miniaturized soft robots, and tissue engineering. By providing opportunities for interdisciplinary research and organizing local scientific activities, this program will train students from diverse backgrounds to be next-generation scientific leaders in soft matter and complex fluids. Through outreach interactions with local high schools, the PI will leverage the vast number of high-speed videos generated from this project to increase the pipeline of underrepresented minority students in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The research goal of this project is to elucidate the nonlinear fluid dynamics associated with all-aqueous printing viscoelastic droplets in yield-stress fluids. A printing platform will be developed to study the dynamics of droplet printing in real time. Moreover, a strategy will be developed to independently control the viscosity and relaxation time of inks. Using these tools and materials, three questions will be explored: (1) How to generate a viscoelastic droplet of good roundness without the help of interfacial tension? (2) What are the mechanisms for detaching the print nozzle from a viscoelastic droplet? (3) What are the parameters determining the roundness of a relaxed droplet? Corroborating experiments with theory and modeling, universal scaling laws will be developed to predict the dependence of droplet fidelity on printing conditions and the nonlinear rheological properties of inks. Finally, exploiting controlled polymer swelling, it will be printed 3D structures consisting of interconnected yet distinguishable hydrogel particles of different properties. These studies are expected to help establish the foundational science for voxelated bioprinting.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent technological advances in the areas of artificial intelligence, fake audio generation, and easy access to smart speakers pose serious security and privacy threats to voice activated devices/services (VAD/S)-based systems. Researchers have demonstrated existing VAD/S are vulnerable to attacks and the growing adoption of VAD/S for e-commerce, voice-based search, and speaker recognition-based banking and remote identity verification highlights the problem. The proposed technology aims to secure VAD/S, e.g., Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Apple Siri, etc., against a growing number of attacks including spoofing, replay, and deepfake attacks. Specifically, the proposed technology may reliably detect and prevent attacks on speaker/speech recognition systems using liveness detection for real-time systems and determine integrity verification for off-line systems. In addition, the proposed technology may benefit other areas including multimedia forensics, e-discovery, remote biometric verification, law enforcement and the entertainment industry.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of real-time liveness detection and integrity authentication of digital audio data. This is a relevant problem that concerns security of many critical applications central to modern digital usage such as speaker verification, speech recognition, fintech, e-commerce, and social medial platforms. Reliable liveness detection may be used to counter the threat of deepfakes to speaker verification and the spread of disinformation and falsehood on social media platforms while safeguarding speaker verification systems commonly used for noninvasive identity verification. The proposed liveness detection and integrity verification of audio data framework relies on the physics of acoustic and photo-acoustic processes and mathematical modeling of distortion artifacts due replay attacks.  The solution will use these to detect liveness of audio with the input of voice activated devices and services. In addition, the proposed innovation leverages the acoustic environment, acquisition device, and post-processing artifacts for forensic analysis and content integrity authentication. This technology may protect VAD/S against the growing number of attacks and provide forensic examiners and law enforcement personnel with a powerful, computationally efficient, scalable, and reliable tool to perform online as well as offline forensics analysis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The measurement of stable isotopes of transition metals such as zinc, iron, and copper, could also be applied to the study of living or fossil primate bone to provide additional insight into these factors.  This project measures transition metal isotopes in bone from primate individuals, and links them to information known from these individuals during life, to better understand how these markers might help reconstruct information about meat consumption and infant feeding patterns from fossilized bone. The results of this project also provide information about how individual- and sex-specific differences in metabolism influence these measurements. This is a multi-institutional collaborative project that includes mentoring of undergraduate students from groups underrepresented in STEM, community outreach, and presentations to local schools.<br/><br/>This research has three main aims: 1) Are the breastfeeding and weaning patterns of primates recorded by ?66Zn values in enamel bioapatite and bone? 2) How does infrequent meat consumption affect the ?66Zn values measured in bioapatite? 3) Do sex- related differences in Fe and Cu fractionation occur in primates and does the degree of female reproductive investment affect these values? Analytic approaches include transition isotope analysis using mass spectrometry, and the application of a logistic regression with a machine learning algorithm to predict diet category (frugivorous/herbivorous or omnivorous/meat consuming) and trophic position of the samples. Transition metals (Zn, Fe, Cu) have the potential to be indicators of trophic position (?66Zn), sex and reproductive state (?56Fe and ?65Cu) in prehistoric and even fossil skeletal elements with poor organic preservation.

The long-term health of children born prematurely is a major national and international concern. Each year more than 15 million infants globally, and 350,000 infants in the US are born prematurely. High-quality clinical research has driven huge advances in prenatal care and allowed intervention to become the standard of care at gestations that were considered incompatible with survival just 20-30 years ago. Infants born at 22-23 weeks of gestation, weighing 400-500 grams are now routinely admitted for intensive care intervention. Respiratory failure remains the primary cause of mortality and morbidity in extremely premature newborns, yet physiologic monitoring of respiratory status has not advanced since the introduction of oxygen saturation monitoring in the 1980s. The proposed tri-functional tube may provide value by continuously monitoring vital signs while simultaneously feeding and venting the extremely preterm infant in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU), avoiding the need for skin-mounted sensors, which are an irritant to newborn skin and produce unreliable readings due to poor contact. Current healthcare costs to society potentially may be reduced using this tri-functional tube technology.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a tri-functional (feeding, venting, and sensing) tube for premature infants. This technology integrates three functionalities for the first time: delivering milk feeds to the stomach, venting excess gas from the stomach (a by-product of non-invasive modes of ventilation), and multifunctional vital sign monitoring such as electrocardiogram (ECG), transdiaphragmatic pressure, and body core temperature. The tri-functional tube design has evolved through multiple iterations based on clinical needs and engineering input. Extensive literature and product reviews, as well as testing results, have defined optimal sensor locations and configurations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Cement manufacturing produces 8% of total global carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions. Hence, there is a need to find alternative chemistries for this vital building material to reduce gas emissions. This project has three goals, the first one involves determining how to produce these novel formulations in large scale and in a factory instead of on laboratory benches. The second goal relates to the understanding of how feedstock availability and manufacturing capacity can meet market demands for commercialization. Finally, the third goal will allow the understanding of the safety of the new materials. These research, scalability and implementation questions will be answered in collaboration with an industrial partner, which is one of the leading makers of concrete block in the United States. In addition to the technical and commercialization benefits, this project will also train students to become leaders and entrepreneurs.<br/><br/>The proposed project seeks to develop a minimum viable product consisting of a low-carbon high-performance concrete block. The materials will resemble ancient Roman cements in chemical composition but with a much higher carbon uptake potential. Collaborative research with a corporate partner will enable the refinement of material formulations and curing processes for manufacturability. Specifically, this project will examine the use of blended cements to improve CO2 permeability, use of sodium bicarbonate salts to cure from within, and harness the role of trace metals additives in the slag to enhance the strength of the material. A quantitative sustainable design model will be developed and used to identify important parameters for the selection of the materials to reduce carbon emissions. The ultimate goal of the project is to make a concrete block prototype with a compressive strength of 15 MPa and a carbon uptake (net negative) potential of 1 kg CO2 per cement block for under $5. The current conventional concrete block has a compressive strength of 12 MPa and carbon emissions (net positive) of 5 kg CO2 per cement block for around $2.

The existing works on dynamic graphs show only limited scalability for large-scale practical datasets. This proposed research aims at designing fast, scalable methods for revealing dynamic behaviors of a socio-technical system by developing innovative algorithmic and computing techniques.

Thus, the project will enhance the scientific research, training, and education capacity of the PI?s jurisdiction.<br/><br/>The goal of this EPSCoR proposal is to develop fast and scalable methods for mining and analyzing large dynamic graphs. Examples of such graphs include social networks, human contact networks, web graphs, and functional brain networks. The proposal addresses substructure-based problems such as finding evolving communities and enumerating interesting temporal subgraphs or motifs with applications in neuroscience, bioinformatics, infrastructure, and social domains. Even though there exists a rich literature for static graphs, the literature for dynamic graphs is very nascent. Existing parallel algorithms for dynamic graphs demonstrate limited scalability due to their low ratio of compute to memory operations and the irregular memory access patterns. Consequently, such algorithms show weak spatial and temporal locality, leading to poor cache utilization and high communication volume. The proposed research will utilize a unique collaboration with the Performance and Algorithms Group of Berkeley Lab to avail the most advanced user facilities and leading expertise to tackle the above technical challenges. The proposal aims at developing scalable parallel methods with efficient load-balancing and communication-avoidance techniques, data reduction approaches with sampling and sparsification, and efficient formalization of temporal metrics. Algorithmic methods generated from this proposal will be applicable in understanding dynamic properties of various real-world systems?for instance, locating key neurons in cortical (brain) networks, route-planning for time-varying traffic in infrastructure networks, modeling disease/virus or information propagation in social/contact networks.

However, they inherit software bugs present in all computing systems. Firmware vulnerabilities have thus become one of the main targets of real-world exploitation. Successful exploitation can cause disastrous consequences to critical infrastructures (e.g., power outages and plant damage) and endanger human lives (e.g., by disabling a pacemaker). In the software community, there has been a rich body of knowledge regarding bug discovery and attack mitigation. However, it is notoriously difficult to apply these results to MCU firmware. Indeed, MCU firmware runs on resource-constrained hardware with heterogeneous architectures, integrates custom runtime environments, and makes unpredictable interactions with the physical world. This renders existing dynamic analysis techniques incompatible, expensive, and ineffective. The proposed research will cross the technical barriers imposed by the aforementioned challenges and greatly enrich the arsenal of MCU firmware security with new knowledge, frameworks, analysis tools, and supporting techniques. Due to the critical roles that MCU devices take in real life, this project will make huge progress towards securing the cyberspace and enhancing national security.<br/> <br/>A key observation of this project is that MCU devices usually cannot operate by themselves. Rather, they have to rely on certain external computers in their entire life cycles. Therefore, around a unifying theme of offloading security analysis from the original application workload to more capable nearby workstations or hubs, this project will deliver a series of new methodologies and theories to significantly improve the lifetime security of MCU devices. With the decoupled design, three research thrusts will be investigated. The first thrust focuses on new techniques to automatically discover firmware vulnerabilities, such as bugs lurking deeply in the program space. The second thrust targets run-time monitoring of firmware execution in the production environment, allowing the stakeholders to detect ongoing attacks and catch bugs that never happen during in-house testing. The third thrust, cooperating with the second thrust, investigates vulnerability remediation techniques, in particular, how to efficiently diagnose production bugs without leaking privacy. The outcomes of this research will be freely distributed to the community. This research will also be integrated into the investigator?s education plan to develop a set of Virtual Machine-based labs to educate young minds and future embedded system developers and architects about MCU security.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project trains a graduate student in scientific cultural anthropology and disseminates its findings broadly to academic and non-academic audiences. <br/><br/>The project seeks to investigate how minority and majority populations interact and shape each other?s identities, cultural markers, and claims of political belonging. Using participant observation, surveys, interviews, and archival research, the investigators query the following: 1) how literary, religious, and ethnic associations understand and interpret linguistic and ethnic identities; and if and in what ways language and other ethnic markers are used by majority and minority populations to interpret political belonging. In doing so, the researchers help to resolve fundamental questions regarding interrelationships among populations and the markers they use to mediate those relationships.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over its six-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 21 unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in biology, neuroscience, and applied mathematical science. First-year students, particularly students who attend rural high schools in the region, will receive scholarships for four years. Scholarships will begin at $6,500 in Year 1 and incrementally increase to $8,000 in Year 4 based on financial need. Additionally, students will receive summer scholarships of $2,000 during Years 2-4 for those scholars who opt to take six credits of summer courses for academic advancement or recovery. Informed by the research literature, institutional data, and student survey data, the curricular and co-curricular supports include implementation of mathematics support in early gateway STEM courses through co-requisite pre-calculus courses; a summer bridge program; development and support of mindfulness practices by scholars that include self-visualization; robust faculty mentoring; peer tutoring; micro-credentials; networking; undergraduate research experiences and internships; and placement into student cohorts. Recognizing the importance of financial support and a robust system of academic and co-curricular support and cohorts, the design of project activities and strategies respond to the impact of COVID-19 on secondary and post-secondary education. <br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need at Wesleyan College, a small liberal arts college for women. Four objectives provide a framework for the project to achieve its goal. First is the recruitment and enrollment of 21 low-income academically talented female undergraduate scholars in biology, neuroscience, and applied mathematical science. Second is the retention of 71% of the scholars in their STEM majors from their first to second year. Third is meeting a graduation target of 67% of scholars in STEM and ensuring that 79% of the graduating scholars enter into the STEM workforce or graduate studies in STEM. Fourth, and finally, is investigation into the efficacy of the proposed strategies and activities to influence student success and the influence of mindfulness practices in reducing stress overall and specifically in gateway mathematics courses. To support and inform project implementation and contribute to a deep understanding of psychosocial factors influencing student success, a mixed methods evaluation and research study will be conducted using quantitative and qualitative research methods for project improvement (formative evaluation), accountability (summative evaluation), and knowledge generation. Findings resulting from this project will be disseminated throughout the Wesleyan College community; statewide conferences for mathematics teachers; local, regional, state, and national conferences focused on curricular and co-curricular innovation (e.g., First Year Experience, undergraduate research experiences, education of women students); and research conferences on education. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields.

Many modern chemical transport models, which are used to study atmospheric chemistry in our atmosphere, are computationally expensive, and as such many research groups continue to rely on relatively coarse resolution simulations. However, recent advancements have enabled higher spatial resolution simulations, and the investigators in this project will study biases and differences in model simulations that arise from different spatial resolutions. The knowledge gained in this project will enhance our ability to simulate and study smaller-scale atmospheric chemistry phenomena, is likely to increase confidence in and usage of high-resolution models in the future, and would enable more atmospheric chemistry research relevant to communities at the local and regional scale. <br/><br/>In this proposed work, the investigators will utilize a high-performance implementation of GEOS-Chem (GCHP) that has recently developed distributed-memory parallelization that enables just this type of scale-varying research.

Some of these noncoding regions are transcribed to produce long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are processed similarly to protein-encoding messenger RNAs. Although they are often found only at low amounts within a cell, lncRNAs have been implicated in a myriad of biological processes including cell growth and survival, cell identity and environmental interactions, as well as numerous human and animal diseases. The next frontier will be to tap into the biotechnology potentially inherent to these lncRNAs. This project will use a synthetic, ?understanding by building? approach to rationally design and use lncRNAs to control large swaths of chromosomal DNA. Broad utility will be demonstrated by using this new RNA technology in human cells and in yeast (fungi). Engineering lncRNAs to control their activity will not only contribute to fundamental understanding of these enigmatic RNAs, but also tap the vast potential to generate useful biomolecules in agricultural and medical applications across species. The project includes uniquely tailored programming to support STEM workforce development for participants ranging from high school students to postdoctoral fellows. New virtual and hands-on activities focused on RNA biology will be integrated with successful STEM outreach programs to ensure strong impact.<br/><br/>This project seeks to define the minimal features that are required for large-scale silencing mediated by lncRNA, building off of the well-characterized Xic locus and its associated lncRNA, Xist, which is responsible for silencing one of the X chromosomes in female mammals and marsupials. The ultimate goal is to gain fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which lncRNAs can exert silencing effects at a chromosomal scale despite being expressed at a low level in the cell. To tackle this, the investigators will first test the effects of different repeats on silencing ability in a mammalian cell culture system. They will then attempt to silence autosomal loci by integrating synthetic lncRNAs into other chromosomes, or via CRISPR-based targeting. We will use these data to parameterize mathematical models to better understand the dynamics and limitations of the silencing process. They will also create a stand-alone silencing system in haploid yeast cells using components of the Xist system. This will enable detailed genetic manipulations to further test and optimize the silencing system using the power of yeast genetics. Finally, the project will use the data to guide rational design of synthetic silencing systems that can be readily deployed in mammalian cells to achieve targeted and tunable silencing. Overall, the investigators expect to push the boundaries of the current understanding of lncRNA functions in the nucleus, with anticipated outcomes to include defining the minimal components and lncRNA levels required for stable and specific epigenetic regulation. By reconstituting functional components from the ground-up, they expect to validate, challenge, and/or expand fundamental mechanics involving RNAs. Given that tunable lncRNA modulation could be a broadly applicable biotechnology, this work has exciting implications for bioengineering.<br/><br/>This collaborative project resulted from an NSF-sponsored Ideas Lab.

The summer school will be from May 16-19, immediately followed by the conference from May 20-24. One major challenge in mathematical fluid dynamics is to study the viability of the basic mathematical models, like the Euler and Navier-Stokes equations, on reasonably long intervals of time. Another major challenge is to determine what the models have to say about turbulent phenomena and the behavior of fluid flows in the long-term. These seemingly unrelated areas of study are connected by a core of principles and techniques. One of the main goals of the summer school and conference is to bring together leading experts in the analysis of fluid equations to explore these connections and chart future a course of action, to provide junior researchers with the tools to enter these fields, and to bring the opportunity to disseminate and discuss the latest cutting-edge results in the field. The award funds will help defray travel and local expenses of the participants, emphasizing the support of a diverse group of students, postdocs, and junior researchers.  <br/><br/>The main questions that will be considered at this conference relate to the well-posedness and the long-time and statistical behavior of fluid equations and related physical models. In recent years, the PDE analysis of fluid flows and related equations has seen numerous important advances on all the above fronts. There have been numerous breakthroughs in the study of well-posedness and the short-time behavior of solutions, both weak and smooth. Powerful techniques have been introduced to study many problems related to well-posedness of the fundamental equations and related models. There have also been spectacular advances on the study of the long-time behavior and statistical properties of solutions, where new and seemingly generic relaxation mechanisms have been discovered. The conference we are organizing brings together experts from around the world to present recent advances in these areas of research and gives them a venue to foster collaboration and a healthy exchange of ideas.

Many classical ncRNAs play fundamental roles in biology including translation (tRNAs, rRNAs), splicing (snRNAs), post-transcriptional gene regulation (miRNAs), and many other biological processes. While these known ncRNAs are important for all life, they may be just the tip of the ncRNA iceberg. In fact, we expect that there are many ncRNA classes that remain uncharacterized. These are referred to as the ?dark matter? of the genome because we don?t know what biological roles they may play. In parallel, protein studies have determined that thousands of human proteins bind to RNA. Yet it remains unknown how many of these RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with ncRNAs, and which specific ncRNAs they might interact with. Our goal is to tackle both problems using very large-scale RNA-protein binding assays combined with computational analysis to uncover new classes of ncRNAs en masse. We will identify specific groups of RNAs that interact strongly with RBPs, develop models that define interaction specificity, and classification systems to predict interactions from sequence and structural data. We will also create a web-accessible database of our findings, allowing anyone to access the data and train undergraduates. We expect to reveal the biological functions of novel ncRNA classes, which will lay the foundation for biotechnology development.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, global RNA-centric proteomics methods like crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and related approaches have enabled unprecedented exploration of RNA-protein interactions. These efforts have vastly expanded the number of identified RBPs, with >4,000 human proteins (~20% of the human proteome) currently annotated as ?RNA-binding? by UniProt. However, because CLIP approaches can only map a single protein at a time, it is challenging to explore the thousands of annotated RBPs. As a result, consortium efforts like ENCODE are time-consuming and expensive, and have been limited to mapping a fraction of the RBPs in the human proteome. Thus, the creation of a comprehensive RBP-ncRNA interactome is near impossible with current approaches. We will use a newly developed, highly multiplexed approach to generate transcriptome-wide measurements across hundreds of RBPs in a single experiment. We will combine this with cutting edge computational and evolutionary strategies to uncover and classify novel classes of ncRNAs en masse. Our goal is to comprehensively discover and characterize novel classes of ncRNAs in the human transcriptome and assess their phylogeny in a way that is impossible using existing methods. To achieve this goal, we will develop novel experimental methods and integrative computational pipelines that will systematically identify novel classes of ncRNAs by combining both known and novel RNA-protein interactions and uncover clusters of multivalent interactions. We will identify conserved sequence and structural motifs, and evolutionary patterns specific to the novel classes, and develop computational systems to recognize members of the novel classes from these data.<br/><br/>This award was the result of an Ideas Lab that was co-sponsored by the four divisions in the NSF Directorate of Biological Sciences.

Hydrogen fuel cells have the potential to address most of those requirements. The potential commercial impact of the proposed project stems from increasing societal interest and market needs in clean energy and a sustainable environment. The technology will contribute to the replacement of fossil fuels and reduce emissions from stationary power plants and on-road/off-road transportation.

Some data-intensive digital agriculture technologies have been in use in farms and other food production operations since the 1990s. The range of digital agricultural technologies is now expanding rapidly and some of these technologies are being introduced more widely. Historically most agricultural technologies have brought impacts beyond the obvious realms of yield and farmer profits, including impacts on technical knowledge, on dependencies, and relations among farmers. Given the diversity in emerging digital technologies and in the settings into which they are being introduced, such indirect impacts will be highly diverse and difficult to predict. To date, most research on digital agriculture has focused on a narrow set of issues, with scant attention to indirect impacts and little analysis from a comparative perspective. This EAGER project will conduct exploratory pilot research in diverse settings to collect data to allow investigators to develop a comparative, multi-sited study of this range of impacts. The project is appropriate for EAGER funding because it aims to collect data to test and evaluate questions as a step towards developing a proposal for the larger comparative project.<br/><br/>Interviews will be conducted by a team of researchers with local knowledge of agriculture across multiple sites and scales. While the specific digital technologies and farmer characteristics will, by design, vary greatly across sites, researchers will investigate four sets of related questions in each setting. The first concerns identifying the recipients of information about farm operations and farmer behavior. Potential recipients include private companies, government offices, extension agents, CGIAR researchers, and academic analysts. Each of these has distinct expertise and sets of interests. The second concerns the social dynamics of adoption and non-adoption. Farmer decisions on adoption may be driven by various factors other than simple bottom-line profit expectations.

The solution will renew the battery catalyst without its removal from the vehicle. This will result in significant savings toward the total cost of ownership and an increase in overall system reliability, one of the top features potential customers evaluate when making automotive purchasing decisions. The transportation industry has been seeking innovations to transition to sustainable solutions such as zero-emission and green hydrogen fuel cell technologies, but the broad adoption of such vehicles is limited by the short lifespan of fuel cell electrocatalysts that operate, expensive fuel cell stack replacements, and the high costs of components. This project will make hydrogen fuel cell vehicles viable and cost-competitive with diesel and gasoline engine vehicles by extending the lifetime of the electrocatalyst and thereby the fuel cell stack. Such alternative options are needed, as diesel vehicles are responsible for around 20% of anthropogenic pollution precursor emissions, and these emissions are linked to approximately 110,000 premature deaths per year.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to establish a proof-of-concept approach for in-stack platinum electrocatalyst renewal. Since fuel cell electrocatalysts degrade during operation, this project will develop a breakthrough technology that enables the reuse of what was once considered expended, end-of-life fuel cells by renewing the electrocatalyst.  This renewal process can be conducted multiple times after the electrocatalyst inevitably degrades, increasing the lifetime and durability for fuel cell operation. As one of the most expensive precious metals, platinum typically used as the catalyst for automotive applications contributes to about 60% of the total fuel cell cost. This process is the first-in-kind to allow electrocatalyst renewal at the surface of the electrode without removing or replacing the fuel cell stack. This project will establish working parameters for the electrocatalyst renewal and analyze the effects of the process using a custom testing apparatus with a 3-electrode configuration and on commercial fuel cell membrane electrode assemblies in custom single-cell configurations. This team will utilize several techniques including analytical electrochemistry, microscopy, and electron paramagnetic resonance techniques to verify the effects of the process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, males that form highly selective pair bonds with one female might be less generally social whereas males that are highly social may express an alternative mating tactic, where they court and mate promiscuously with many females despite being bonded. This project proposes that understanding new and distinct mating tactics that emerge in some males requires understanding the interaction of brain-behavior relationships that underlie high sociability (known as prosocial behavior) and selective social behavior that leads to pairbonding. By exploring brain-behavior relationships of these two social behaviors, the project aims to understand the neural sources for behaviors that can only be studied by indirectly exploring the neural sources of other behaviors within the social brain. In this case, understanding male fidelity to a pairbonded partner requires understanding the neural basis of variation in sociability. This project explores the novel idea that some social behaviors are indirectly rooted in neural circuitry that serves a distinct but similar function. The aims of these studies represent a shift in thinking about the function of the social brain. In doing so, we will train undergraduate students in advanced techniques in neuroscience, and formally train them to engage in science outreach with a population of underserved (mostly refugee) elementary school-aged children. <br/><br/>Technical abstract<br/><br/>Sociality and mating systems are interdependent classes of behavior that govern distinct elements of reproductive decision-making. This project will disentangle the aggregated effects of general and selective prosocial behavior to study variation in alternative reproductive tactics. The hypothesis is high sociability creates opportunities for sexual infidelity via social access. The lateral septum (LS) is highly networked and impacts both sociability and mating system. Focus is placed on prairie voles, a socially monogamous species where pairbonded males vary in sexual fidelity, in spite of maintaining strong pairbonds. A key prediction is that social promiscuity (i.e., non-specific social approach) is gated by the connections between the medial bed nucleus of the stria terminalis (BSTm) and the LS. High sociability should create opportunities for animals to engage in extra-pair courtship and copulation independent of bond strength. The project will determine: [1] the role of BSTm-LS neuronal activity in regulating social monogamy using retro-Cre chemogenetic neural manipulations, [2] how vasopressin and GABA in the LS modulate social approach and sexual infidelity using pharmacological manipulation and visualizing neural activity, and [3] if LS neural activation via chemogenetics affects social approach and mating decisions in a complex social context. This research will exploit the intersection between prosociality and monogamy to broaden understanding of social brain function by manipulating neuronal function in one domain of social behavior to observe the consequences in another (reproductive decision-making). The project will leverage a strong record of training URM students at all levels in advanced methods in neuroethology, and community engagement with underserved and marginalized K-12 aged children in a community classroom environment.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

With this safety net, more cryptocurrency owners would feel comfortable entering the market, expanding the platform beyond the 1 billion members expected by 2023. Current blockchain participants have opened their identities and transactions for the world to see even though they risk the dangers that come with that transparency. Even participants that have not disclosed their wallet identities have found their true identities to have been compromised and have faced threats. When an owner conducts a large cryptocurrency transaction, the risk of damage due to exposure can be high whether it be for individuals or businesses. For those market segments, confidentiality - as a service enabled by this technology - would help lower the risk of exposure and thus reduce damage substantially. <br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a technology platform to enable confidentiality and transaction monitoring as a service for blockchain systems with the goal of reducing transaction costs and enhancing auditability. The core technology that undergirds the platform combines a machine learning algorithm with secure encryption techniques. This platform will satisfy regulatory requirements and provide safety as well as confidentiality for blockchain users and platforms. The approach uses machine learning, optimization, and encryption techniques to mask transactions and to provide confidentiality while also using machine learning algorithms to discern when suspicious activity is happening on the transaction graph. The privacy-preserving machine learning techniques have never been used in production in the context of blockchain. Intellectually, the algorithms enhance the understanding of the effectiveness of machine learning techniques on encrypted data. The technology will reduce financial crime while preserving confidentiality.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To address these questions, the researchers carry out experiments with infants who are exposed to only one language, infants who are bilingually exposed to two languages, and with monolingual English-speaking college students who are in the process of learning a second language. The experiments for all the participants involve testing their ability to learn artificial languages that have been designed to have important similarities to real human languages. By investigating what properties of the artificial languages are easier or harder to learn for various groups of participants, the researchers understand how a person's overall experience with languages influences their learning of new ones. The results of this project generate insights into the process of normal language learning that can be used to design language interventions for people with language learning difficulties. This project provides training opportunities for undergraduate students, to gain expertise in psycholinguistic research.<br/><br/>The language properties we investigate involve dependencies between words that arise because of the grammatical rules of the language, in particular non-adjacent dependencies (NADs) that involve words that are not immediately adjacent. For example, in typical sentences in English, the form of the verb and the following noun depend on each other, but can be separated. Discovering these dependency patterns is essential for language acquisition. While recent research suggests that learners? prior experience within a laboratory testing session shapes their expectations and influences the types of patterns they subsequently track, there has been little attention to the influence of learners? broader language experience on subsequent learning. This project uses behavioral measures to examine the interactions between someone?s prior language experience and the ability to learn and generalize from dependency patterns in a new language. The first experiment compares the performances of monolingual and bilingual 12-month-old infants learning different languages on a NAD learning task. It tests two hypotheses: 1) that the structures in 12-month-old infants? exposure to language influence their sensitivity to NADs, and 2) that their bilingual status influences this sensitivity. The second experiment compares the learning of different dependency patterns in native English speakers learning two different languages, and monolingual English speakers. In this experiment, the researchers test the effects of learning one language on the ease of learning an additional language, examining how the particular language that is learned make certain properties of the additional language easier to learn.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Despite this income instability and its potential costs on the wellbeing of the poor, economists, measure of the effects of this instability and unpredictability is limited. This research will use field experiments to study how income instability affects the economic behavior and wellbeing of the poor.  The project involves experimentally manipulating the labor demand for casual work of low wage labor during a period when little other work is available and then study the impact of income instability on consumption, savings, investment other activities as well as  investigate the strategies households use to cope with income instability. The research will also collect data on individuals perceived costs of income instability to measure their willingness to pay to avoid income instability.  The project will provide evidence on the importance of stabilizing incomes as a policy goal.  The results of this research will provide guidance on labor market policies that will improve the lives of low-income workers.  In so doing, it will help to establish the US as a global leader in improving the living standards of low-income workers.<br/><br/><br/>This research will study the causal effects of income risk and of predictable income volatility on economic outcomes and on welfare. To generate exogenous variation in income instability, the PIs experimentally manipulate the labor demand for casual work during a time when there are no alternatives.  The RCT design has three arms: the Stable (S) arm has fixed pay scale and workdays; fluctuations in pay scale and workdays in the Predictable Volatility (PV) arm will be known in advance to workers while fluctuations in pay scale and workdays in the Risky Income (RI) arm will be unknown to the workers.  The expected, number of workdays and pay of all three arms will be the same. Besides baseline data, high frequency panel data on consumption, expenditures, income, savings and assets, loans and debt, and transfers will be collected. The design and empirical analysis will allow the PIs to study the impact of income instability on consumption levels and smoothing and to investigate in detail the strategies used to cope with income instability. In addition to reduced-form analyses, the research will estimate a structural model to conduct a welfare analysis and simulate policy counterfactuals. The PIs will measure the perceived welfare costs of income instability by eliciting individuals? willingness to pay to avoid predictable income volatility.  The PIs will use the structural model to shed further light on mechanisms, to estimate the welfare costs of income instability, and to simulate policy counterfactuals.  The results of this research will help guide labor market policies that stabilizes worker incomes and thus improve the living standards of the working poor.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The extent to which climate variations are predictable in general is not known, but the example of El Nino shows that predictable variations can arise from interactions between the atmosphere and the ocean. Recent research suggests that predictable climate variations could also result from atmosphere-ocean coupling associated with the Gulf Stream and the Kuroshio Current. A critical aspect of the hypothesized coupling is the involvement of small spatial scales, in particular the atmospheric response to the strong and narrow temperature contrasts between the warm waters of the Gulf Stream and Kuroshio currents and the surrounding cold water.  Meanwhile the ocean's response to the atmosphere could involve the mesoscale dynamics of sharp ocean fronts, through which surface winds can induce deep vertical motions.  Deep motions are important as they can connect the atmosphere with levels in the ocean where variability takes place slowly, thus creating the potential for skillful long-lead prediction.<br/><br/>Research conducted here explores the potential for predictability associated with air-sea coupling using climate model simulations performed at high enough resolutions to capture the mechanisms. The research also looks at the potential for high resolution to capture the weather extremes associated with climate variability, for example changes in the distribution of hurricanes and atmospheric rivers associated with El Nino events. Specifically, the Principal Investigators (PIs) perform simulations using the Community Earth System Model (CESM, version 1.3) with 0.25 degree grid spacing for the atmosphere and 0.1 degree spacing for the ocean. The simulations include a 10-member ensemble of uninitialized transient climate simulations from 1920 to 2100, as well as an ensemble of retrospective 5-year climate predictions starting from years between 1982 and 2016.  A number of strategies are pursued to explore the impact of small-scale mechanisms, such as experiments in which the sea surface temperatures produced by the ocean model are smoothed before they are fed into the atmospheric model, thereby disabling small-scale interaction mechanisms.<br/><br/>Skillful predictions of climate variability could have tremendous societal value, as noted above, thus work to establish the extent to which the climate system is in fact predictable, and the physical mechanisms that determine its predictability, has substantial broader impacts. The broader impacts of the project are also served by open access to the simulations generated in the project, which allows researchers around the world to engage in research on climate system predictability.  The PIs also engage in outreach to the research community and the general public through venues including a radio program titled ""On the Ocean"" and International CLIVAR summer schools.  Educational broader impacts come from the PIs' participation in their department's Research Experiences for Undergraduates program, and through the support and training of a postdoctoral associate and a graduate student.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For example, the sea-surface height seen over the Grand Banks was about 7-8 cm higher in 2008-2018 than in 1993-2007. But still unknown are its causes and potential effects on the regional water motions, including the continuity of the Labrador Current and shelf and slope currents. Sea-level changes have broad impacts on coastal habitats, coastal hazards, and wetland ecological systems. The identified sea-level anomaly is accompanied by a rapid rising of water temperature on the shelves, which is known to have adverse impacts on the fishing industry and aquaculture. The project would: 1) investigate forcing mechanisms of this large sea level anomaly in the shelf-slope region; 2) examine how sea-level change on the continental shelf is connected to that in the open ocean; and 3) investigate whether and how the sea level changes on the Newfoundland and Scotian shelves may have affected coastal circulations and sea level off the Northeast US. Project PIs will keep NOAA Northeast Fishery Sciences Center, the Commercial Fisheries Research Foundation, and the wider fishing industry communities informed of relevant results, and engage in a range of outreach and educational activities, including efforts to engage underrepresented minorities. The proposed work is aligned with US CLIVAR Science Plan Addendum ""Research Challenge on Climate at the Coasts,"" and is expected to generate broad interest from both the scientific community and the general public.<br/> <br/>The project identifies seven hypotheses covering the three areas of interest identified above. For the first, concerning forcing mechanisms:  H1A - changes in western boundary currents related to a weakening AMOC or changing wind-driven gyres in subtropical and subpolar basins contribute to the observed SSH anomaly; H1B - a change in surface wind-stress curl forces the observed SSH anomaly; H1C ? an increase in the number of warm core rings contribute to both mass and steric heat fluxes associated with increased WCR activity contribute to the observed SSH changes. For the second, concerning the cross-shelf connection of SSH variability: H2A - the cross-shelf transport in the bottom Ekman layer plays an important role in the cross-shelf SSH connectivity; H2B - the surface wind-driven Ekman layer plays an important role as well;  H2C - eddy PV flux increased and contributed to enhanced cross-shelf connectivity in SSH anomaly. For the third, concerning connections between Grand Banks and Cape Hatteras: H3A - the SSH anomaly on the Newfoundland and Scotian shelves have impacted the along-shelf flows considerably, likely enhancing the equatorward flow from Newfoundland to Cape Hatteras. Both modeling and data analysis will be used to address these hypotheses. The fairly wide range of data used will include: gridded SSH altimetry, global ocean and atmosphere reanalyses, observation-based heat fluxes, evaporation and wind stress, and local multi-year in-situ data from the OOI Pioneer Array and the Oleander line. Modeling will utilize a new Northwest Atlantic Regional Circulation Model, which encompasses the entire shelf and slope region of the Labrador Sea and the Middle Atlantic Bight with a submesoscale-permitting horizontal resolution of 2-km and 40 vertical layers. A two-layer model will be used in parallel with the realistic regional circulation models for process modelling, to help guide analyses and interpretations of data analyses and NWA model simulations, as to help isolate key processes and mechanisms. This model uses realistic bathymetry and forcing and resolves the barotropic and the 1st baroclinic modes. The study will lead to a better understanding of how dynamical processes interact in a rapidly changing climate system, how coastal oceans respond to climate-induced changes in the open ocean, and inform predictability of the Northeast US shelf circulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This REU Site offers research experiences in physical oceanography, ocean ecology and biogeochemistry, and marine geology and geophysics. The project includes a remote internship option, when feasible for the research project, that makes the research experience more accessible for students who cannot attend in person. The objectives of the REU program are to:<br/>1) provide students a high-quality research experience in ocean science and an understanding of its interdisciplinary nature;<br/>2) provide students with professional development and training opportunities facilitating persistence and retention in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) career pathways; and<br/>3) increase access to and participation in ocean sciences by students from under-represented groups through recruitment efforts at regional community colleges and non-research universities.<br/><br/>REU student projects will center around three themes, including 1) Ocean Ecology and Biogeochemistry, 2) Marine Geology and Geophysics, and 3) Physics of Oceans and Atmospheres. Ocean Ecology and Biogeochemistry is concerned with the structure and function of ecosystems across space and time as revealed by the study of the ocean's biological, chemical, and geological processes, including feedbacks between land, atmosphere and ocean. Research backgrounds of OSU faculty include population and community ecology, biogeochemical cycling, and the deep-biosphere. Marine Geology and Geophysics includes research on seafloor and seamount volcanism and extends from the study of magmatic and volcanic processes to tectonic environments in the ocean basins including spreading centers, subduction zones, and hotspots. Paleoceanography at OSU focuses on the Cascadia margin and the high-latitudes of both the Arctic and Antarctic and utilizes premier facilities including the OSU Marine and Geology Repository, one of the nation?s largest archives of marine sediment cores. OSU research in coastal and sedimentary processes emphasizes the nearshore, where ocean hazards intersect with human population and coastal ecosystems. Other subject areas include marine applications of paleomagnetism and seismology. Physics of Oceans and Atmospheres: Projects in physical oceanography include turbulent eddies, internal gravity waves, fronts, and coastal currents, as well as numerical modeling of ocean circulation on local to global scales, ocean acoustics, optics, and remote sensing, and coupled ocean-atmosphere interactions. Research areas within this theme include the study of physical processes acting across the ocean boundaries at the sea floor, coast, and sea surface, and of the ocean's role in the Earth's climate system, spanning a wide range of space and time scales, from turbulence at scales of millimeters and seconds to global circulations at scales of thousands of kilometers and centuries or longer. Research within this theme also involves expansion of observation capabilities in the ocean and atmosphere using an array of ship-based, buoy, seafloor, autonomous, and satellite platforms, as well as data assimilation, visualization, and modeling techniques and development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

New national criminal DNA databases, once limited to high-income countries, are becoming widespread in middle-income countries and they are also beginning to be established in low-income countries. But DNA databases require infrastructural resources and expertise to implement and maintain. How are places that are marked by capacity challenges and conditions of scarcity establishing and running DNA databases under these conditions, and how might their strategies inform the global future of this phenomenon? How does DNA become transformed into something that is reliable and useful in national legal contexts and in international security efforts, and what are the consequences for how science and citizenship are lived and experienced? This research project will address these questions by investigating the intersection between genomics and law, related infrastructural investments, and the networks of people who must work together to transform genetic data into legally legible evidence. Further, this project supports the methods and data analysis training of two graduate students.<br/><br/>This research is supported as an accomplishment-based renewal of highly successful project exploring how the use of genetic technologies in criminal law might change experiences and forms of citizenship as well as social and cultural understandings of science and what constitutes reliable evidence. This research extends that completed through a previous grant by further investigating global criminal forensic genetics as an emerging and expanding citizenship formation with interconnected local, national, and transnational influences and implications. The research will take place in a middle-income context that has been implementing and expanding a 2015 law that creates a criminal DNA database for which the police force has primary responsibility. The project will use ethnographic methodologies to consider how a cross-section of people from diverse socioeconomic backgrounds who have different forms of expertise and different ideas about the meaning of science and justice are brought together through their roles in enacting investments in forensic genetics. The project will include police, forensic laboratories, courtrooms, and NGOs and private companies that contribute to forensic genetics training and advocacy. In this research context investment in genomics for law enforcement is new and actively expanding throughout the research period. Those current investments raise important questions about the global scope and scale, and the local specificity and variation, of intersections between genomics and law. This research therefore offers an actively emerging view into how DNA comes to matter in new ways as it moves out of research laboratories and into a broader public sphere.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The new technology has the potential to achieve significant reductions in oil exploration drilling costs.  The technology will also increase long-term commercial benefits for exploration and production companies due to more accurate and reliable estimates of the recoverable reserves and production planning over the decades-long reservoir lifecycle.  These benefits will support global economic growth by ensuring a continued supply of hydrocarbons for the US and internationally during the critical transition to renewable energies. The new technology being developed under this SBIR project will also reduce the environmental impact, energy consumption, and overall carbon footprint of offshore/onshore E&P operations by reducing waste, pollution, and carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions, thereby directly benefiting future generations. Successful completion of the project will further reinforce the leadership of the US in utilization of advanced hydrocarbon E&P technologies and support the goal of energy independence from global markets by making US producers more effective and competitive.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project proposes to demonstrate the feasibility of determining volumetric (3D) hydrocarbon distribution throughout large-diameter long cores with high spatial resolution (10 mm3), 95% accuracy, and 1 meter/hour throughput at the offshore/onshore wellsite. Today, this is not possible with any technology, i.e., logging data can be used to derive hydrocarbon estimates on a sparse set of points along the wellbore, while ?special core analysis? at onshore laboratories takes weeks to complete. Neither of the current techniques can closely match the resolution and accuracy offered by the proposed solution. The disruptive innovation of this development is to combine 3-dimensional (3D) X-ray Multi-Energy Computed Tomography (MECT) and Electrical Impedance Tomography (EIT) in one wellsite core scanning instrument, thereby allowing for novel, synergistic combination of the information provided by the MECT and EIT modalities. Algorithms will be developed to combine the complementary datasets to yield 3D hydrocarbon distribution in the cores in near real-time. These algorithms will be tested on realistic digital core models. The ultimate goal of Phase I is to demonstrate that the specified target accuracy, spatial resolution, and scanning-imaging throughput for assessing 3D distribution of hydrocarbons in large cores can be achieved with the new wellsite instrument.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many classical ncRNAs play fundamental roles in biology including translation (tRNAs, rRNAs), splicing (snRNAs), post-transcriptional gene regulation (miRNAs), and many other biological processes. While these known ncRNAs are important for all life, they may be just the tip of the ncRNA iceberg. In fact, we expect that there are many ncRNA classes that remain uncharacterized. These are referred to as the ?dark matter? of the genome because we don?t know what biological roles they may play. In parallel, protein studies have determined that thousands of human proteins bind to RNA. Yet it remains unknown how many of these RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with ncRNAs, and which specific ncRNAs they might interact with. Our goal is to tackle both problems using very large-scale RNA-protein binding assays combined with computational analysis to uncover new classes of ncRNAs en masse. We will identify specific groups of RNAs that interact strongly with RBPs, develop models that define interaction specificity, and classification systems to predict interactions from sequence and structural data. We will also create a web-accessible database of our findings, allowing anyone to access the data and train undergraduates. We expect to reveal the biological functions of novel ncRNA classes, which will lay the foundation for biotechnology development.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, global RNA-centric proteomics methods like crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and related approaches have enabled unprecedented exploration of RNA-protein interactions. These efforts have vastly expanded the number of identified RBPs, with >4,000 human proteins (~20% of the human proteome) currently annotated as ?RNA-binding? by UniProt. However, because CLIP approaches can only map a single protein at a time, it is challenging to explore the thousands of annotated RBPs. As a result, consortium efforts like ENCODE are time-consuming and expensive, and have been limited to mapping a fraction of the RBPs in the human proteome. Thus, the creation of a comprehensive RBP-ncRNA interactome is near impossible with current approaches. We will use a newly developed, highly multiplexed approach to generate transcriptome-wide measurements across hundreds of RBPs in a single experiment. We will combine this with cutting edge computational and evolutionary strategies to uncover and classify novel classes of ncRNAs en masse. Our goal is to comprehensively discover and characterize novel classes of ncRNAs in the human transcriptome and assess their phylogeny in a way that is impossible using existing methods. To achieve this goal, we will develop novel experimental methods and integrative computational pipelines that will systematically identify novel classes of ncRNAs by combining both known and novel RNA-protein interactions and uncover clusters of multivalent interactions. We will identify conserved sequence and structural motifs, and evolutionary patterns specific to the novel classes, and develop computational systems to recognize members of the novel classes from these data.<br/><br/>This award was the result of an Ideas Lab that was co-sponsored by the four divisions in the NSF Directorate of Biological Sciences.

Recent advances in web-based software now make it possible for taxonomic experts to receive greater professional recognition and citation of their digitized biological specimens and identifications. Use of these software tools can increase the visibility of scientists as well as modernize the professional rewards system to support the development of taxonomic expertise. However, creating a self-sustaining cycle of specimen attribution and citation that leverages this new software requires greater awareness by collections-based researchers and cultural change in how taxonomic expertise is credited. At the heart of this change is ensuring that the names of the people who collect and identify biological research specimens are disambiguated and associated with globally unique identifiers. Accurate people-data are an essential part of the vision for an extended specimen network because they link groups of specimens across institutions and uncover events in the history of science. The project will develop research infrastructure that is more inclusive, because taxonomic contributions by all people would be acknowledged explicitly, and sustainable, because improved recognition of taxonomic expertise would help build and sustain this scientific workforce in the US.<br/><br/>Workshops will include 75 participants and the symposia will feature 12 diverse speakers, who will reach an anticipated audience of 190 collections-based researchers. Speakers will deliver case-studies that illustrate integrating people-data into the digital infrastructure of biological research collections. The workshop will comprise four hours of instruction about the use of globally unique identifiers for people within the biodiversity informatics open-access software services of Bionomia and the Global Biodiversity Information Facility and their interaction with Open Researcher and Contributor ID, Wikidata, and Zenodo. Participants will learn how to use these tools as part of documenting their own collections-based research activities and as a means of community-level change in how taxonomic expertise is acknowledged. For the latter objective, participants will practice attributing US herbarium specimens to historical people from underrepresented groups, which will increase the visibility of these scientists? intellectual contributions to biological research collections as well as improve the curation of digitized US biological research collections. Extensive plans are included to ensure broad participation, including outreach methods to underrepresented groups and support to participants in the form of travel stipend and dependent-care assistance. Workshop and symposium outcomes will be assessed rigorously and shared with the broader systematics community as a model for improving how taxonomic expertise is credited.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Writing is particularly crucial in statistics, and short answer questions provide students with important opportunities to interpret problems and consider multiple paths to a correct solution. Because students must formulate their answers in their own words, short answer questions are more robust for authentic assessment of student competencies and misconceptions than other short-form problems, such as multiple choice or true/false questions. For all assessments, timely feedback is well established as important for learning. Unfortunately, providing timely, quality feedback on student writing can be challenging in large classes. This can lead to assessment methods being poorly aligned with learning goals in the courses that reach the most students. This Level 1 project in the Engaged Student Learning track of the IUSE: EDU program addresses this long-standing obstacle to the effective use of free-form questions in large-enrollment classes.  The project will develop, test, and refine a grading support platform that combines human and machine assessment. Specifically, the tools developed will sort students' solutions to short-answer problems into one of three categories: essentially correct, partially correct, or incorrect.  Partially correct solutions are then sent to the course instructor for further review. The project engages partner institutions throughout the country to collect diverse data on statistics question prompts and student answers. The project-developed tools will give students more opportunities to strengthen their reasoning skills through exposure to short-answer problems and will give instructors a tool to monitor learning more closely.<br/><br/>This project?s goal is to advance understanding and study effectiveness of innovative tools that pair instructor expertise with natural language processing (NLP) techniques to provide students with rich feedback. Integrating the project platform into introductory statistics courses will allow for the frequent use of short-answer tasks in large enrollment statistics classes. Large-enrollment course instructors will be able to provide detailed feedback much like students might expect in a class with 25-30 students. The project utilizes a collaboration of prominent experts in NLP, statistics education, and assessment to pursue the three aims of 1) developing an interactive, scalable, human/software partnership, 2) field-testing the methods across diverse student populations, and 3) creating open access resources of software, assessment tasks, and student data to foster future research on free-form formative assessments. The project will utilize a mixed-methods evaluation plan to assess progress towards key goals and the project-developed platform will be made freely available to interested users.

The energy of these internal waves often trickles down to smaller waves that eventually dissipate, a process known as the energy cascade. The cascade process can lead to mixing, and determines the heat and salt balances and general circulation of the ocean. This project will investigate this energy cascade through theory, modeling, and data analysis. The existing theory of the energy cascade, based on the turbulence produced by internal waves, will be improved in this study (with existing controversies resolved) and extended to more realistic situations. Subsequent validation of the improved theory will be done with high-resolution regional model simulations. The project will also apply this improved theory to a global model simulation and establish a geographic map of dissipation . Broader impacts include enhancements to global climate models and regional models. The theoretical improvement will inform a range of physical applications and mathematical studies of internal wave turbulence. Annual presentations are planned for the turbulence community. The work supports an early career PI, a postdoc, and teaching and public outreach through the Coastal Ocean Environment Summer School in Ghana and public lectures on the history of fluid mechanics through programs at the UM Museum of Natural History.<br/><br/>The proposed project will establish a comprehensive understanding of the downscale energy cascade of IGW spectra with variable spectral slopes, from both theoretical and computational considerations. Research tasks include: 1) Development of theoretical formulations of energy cascade for spectra with varying slopes in the wave turbulence theory framework, which will be guided and confirmed by simulations of the kinetic equation. 2) Further improvement of the regional MITgcm simulation of 24-32 degrees N, 193-199 degrees E to better match the spectra from McLane profiler measurements (through adjustment of model resolution and K-profile parameterization), computation of the modeled energy cascade with comparison to theoretical results obtained from task 1. 3) Application of the traditional/new finescale parameterization to a global MITgcm model to establish a geographic map of turbulent dissipation rate, and comparison of the results to those from microstructure measurements. The new finescale parameterization formulation from spectra that more closely match spectra from measurements, together with improved regional models through tuning of K-profile parameterization, will lead to fundamentally improved diapycnal mixing parameterizations in ocean models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For the first time, additive manufacturing processes will be applied to silicon in order to produce equivalent performance to silicon wafers without the wasteful processes used in current manufacturing. If successful, this additive approach can link the parts of the solar supply chain that still exist in the United States?silicon refining and solar module assembly, establishing a full domestic supply chain for this critical energy technology. This supply chain can: (a) be built with off-the-shelf equipment at a third the cost of building traditional silicon wafer and cell factories, (b) cut the cost of photovoltaic solar cell manufacturing in half compared to imported silicon wafer-based solar cells, and (c) reduce energy consumption in solar cell manufacturing by 70% and reduce water consumption by 90%.  This combination of low factory and production costs can drive the growth needed in the solar industry to support the nation?s decarbonization goals while creating tens of thousands of domestic jobs.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project seeks to demonstrate the feasibility of a novel architecture and additive manufacturing process for crystalline silicon photovoltaic solar cells that provide equivalent performance to traditional silicon wafer-based solar cells at lower cost with a local supply chain. The steps in the process flow are adapted from traditional solar cell processing or adjacent industries like microelectronics, but they are being combined in new way to realize this solar cell design. These steps will be co-optimized to produce high-efficiency cells using a series of designed experiments. These processes typically fall into three categories: (1) chemical or physical vapor deposition, (2) solution-based coating, and (3) thermal annealing, with their own relevant process variables: (a) time, temperature, pressure, gas flow rates, and magnetic power; (b) solvent, solution concentration, coating gap, and coating speed; (c) temperature vs. time.

Chronic inflammation can be a cause or sign of disease, and inflammatory responses are precursors of poor health outcomes and offer insights into understanding disease onset. This project contributes to a clearer understanding of the ways in which social and environmental factors serve as mechanisms that induce inflammation, linking stress to disease. By focusing analysis on variation in the biomarker C-reactive protein (CRP), a well validated biomarker of inflammation, in relationship to variation in indices of environmental and psychosocial stress, the results of this study can contribute to better identifying the underpinnings of the links between stress, inflammation, environmental drivers, and biological outcomes. This is a community-centered project which provides research training to participants and sets the foundation for future research in this emerging area. <br/><br/>Epigenetic pathways act as channels between social factors and disease risk throughout life, and epigenetic modifications can impact inflammatory responses. In clinically oriented research, variation in outcomes related to human health is often grouped into census-level categories that may not be informative with respect to understanding human biological variation. Incorporating environmental information and evidence of potentially linked epigenetic modifications can offer a more nuanced understanding of variation across the full pathway of causation, from mechanism to outcome. This project aims to 1) understand how variation in social and other environmental factors relates to variation in CRP concentrations, both within and across populations, and 2) to understand how social and environmental factors influence methylation in areas of the genome related to stress physiology and stress response. Taken together, results generated from this project can advance understanding of the underlying mechanisms involved in the transduction of environmental and lived experience to biological outcomes and inform theoretical frameworks regarding the evolution and trade-offs involved in these mechanisms within and across human populations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancerous deaths. This cancer claimed approximately 150,000 lives in the US in 2016, accounting for 25 percent of all cancer deaths. This disease is perilous due to the difficulties in its early-stage diagnosis and poor five-year survival rate (18%). Nevertheless, if detected early, the five-year survival rate can dramatically improve to 56%. Indeed, there is a dire need to develop user-friendly and low-cost, early-stage, lung-cancer diagnosis techniques based on simple body fluids, such as blood, saliva, and urine, for integration into regular wellness checks. In meeting this demand, this project seeks to develop a robust and portable cancer biomarker detection platform for early-stage lung cancer diagnosis from simple bodily fluids.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an on-chip lung-cancer biomarker detection platform.

IH often results in the need for additional surgical intervention with associated costs and increased patient morbidity and mortality. This project will focus on inhibiting the remodeling pathways that lead to IH via RNA therapeutics delivered directly to the injury site. The project will develop vascular targeting liposomes designed to exhibit multifunctional potential to target exposed collagen matrices specific to areas of vascular pathology and enhanced targeted vascular uptake/delivery. Phase I will advance the LNP technology by showing that an active therapeutic encapsulated by the system is appropriately delivered and results in a clinically relevant drug concentration. If successful at delivering bioactive RNA payloads to injured vascular tissues, the technology will reduce the risk of post-intervention complications and reduce the need for revascularization. Ultimately, this novel LNP packaging and delivery system will provide a new tool for advancing a broad range of RNA therapeutics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Comparing brain structure ? or neuroanatomy ? across primate species that live in a wide variety of social organizations can suggest how the brain and sociality are related. Previous studies of primate brain evolution have not included the full extent of social diversity in primates, limiting the conclusions that can be drawn from them. This Doctoral Dissertation Research project combines existing data on neuroanatomy and hormone receptor distributions in the brain from well-studied mammal species and generates new data from species not previously included in prior studies, to better understand how these traits relate to sociality. Beyond sharing data with the scientific community and providing educational opportunities for K-12 students, generating the results from this study allows for advanced training of undergraduates.<br/><br/>Hormones, such as testosterone, estradiol, oxytocin, and vasopressin act in the brain, and must bind their receptors to exert any effects on behavior. In rodents and some primates, the distributions of these hormone receptors in the brain are linked to differences in social behavior; however, previous work from a sample of lemur species shows that the patterns may not be the same across all mammalian species. This project expands prior work through three main objectives: 1) to characterize neuroanatomy in thirteen lemur species and broadly compare it to that of better-studied mammalian species, including rodents and other primates, 2) to investigate sex differences in lemur neuroanatomy in relation to androgen and estrogen receptor expression and variation in female aggression, and 3) to explore the relationship between oxytocin and vasopressin receptor distribution and social bonding. Understanding the neuroanatomical and neuroendocrine correlates of sociality in these unique primate species can advance our knowledge of primate brain evolution, and the interplay between the brain and social behavior more broadly.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Among all foods, fruits and vegetables are the ones with the highest categories of losses, with up to 50-60% of spoiled produce discarded in landfills. The proposed innovation will provide a desirable and healthy protein-fortified coating for food preservation. Moreover, the coating is washable, edible, and glossy providing an all-encompassing yet desirable food preservation solution that benefits consumers, sellers, and farmers. The proposed coating technology will enhance the window for the markets of edible coatings that focuses on the growing health- and sustainability-focused retail stores and health-conscious consumers. Other than reducing food waste and economic losses, the anticipated technology could have significant environmental impacts. For example, reducing food waste can save 25% of the freshwater supply, 3.9 billion tons of fertilizer, 300 million barrels of oil, and 135 million tons of greenhouse gases every year in the USA alone. This project will also benefit the education and training of students related to research translation.<br/><br/>The proposed project is based on the development of an eco-friendly and biodegradable protein-based nanocomposite coating that can be applied to the surface of perishable fruits and vegetables of any shape. On the lab scale, egg and soy-protein composite coatings have significantly extended the shelf life and cosmetic appearance of various fruits. However, testing on a pilot scale will provide a detailed understanding of performance and cost matrices. To fully understand the technological viability of commercializing the proposed coating, the optimum combinations of various proteins with cellulose nanomaterials, chemical modifications of proteins via selected plasticizers and crosslinkers, and easily scalable mechanisms for controlled coating methods will be explored. The coating will extend the shelf life by reducing maturation, senescence, dehydration, and microbial growth rate. The deliverables of this project will be a minimum viable product via pilot-scale studies. Overall, with an end goal of improving the environmental performance and sustainability of the food industry, the outcomes of the research will lead to the development of a protein-based inexpensive, and green coating that will enhance the shelf-life of fruits with the added benefits of biodegradability, washability, edibility, and cosmetic appearance and provide a business feasibility analysis for the potential commercialization of the product.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Regular physical activity (PA) is such an important part of the human environment that its prolonged absence increases the risk for numerous diseases and conditions including lower back pain (LBP), the most common musculoskeletal condition in the world. Although many factors contribute, the strongest predictor of LBP is the endurance of trunk muscles. The endurance of trunk muscles and spine loading depend largely on how much and what types of PA a person routinely engages in. To better understand how PA affects the trunk and spine function, this Doctoral Dissertation Research project studies people engaging in high levels of PA such as walking long distances each day and consistently engaging in manual labor, often while carrying water, food, and infants, compared to people with more sedentary daily activity levels. The project provides research training and collaboration opportunities for local community members and researchers.   <br/><br/>The primary hypothesis tested by this project is that reduced PA generates low levels of trunk muscle activity and spinal loading which are associated with low trunk muscle endurance. To test this hypothesis, novel wearable sensors that measure bodily movement and back muscle activity are combined with computer-based musculoskeletal modeling to compare spinal loading and back muscle activation levels between rural (high-activity) and urban (low-activity) populations to assess whether differences in spinal loading and back muscle activation levels are associated with trunk muscle endurance. The project also uses wearable sensors to test how trunk muscle endurance affects two spine functions hypothesized to be associated with LBP: modulation of spine stiffness during walking and the distribution of compression and shear forces generated in the spine during walking. By making use of a research design where two populations with different PA profiles live in geographic proximity, this project addresses why and how engaging in PAs at different levels may help our bodies, and specifically our backs and spines, function better and stay LBP-free. Ultimately the results of this research can contribute to our understanding of how our modern activity levels may be a mismatch for the levels of activity experienced throughout human evolution.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These winds and currents are important components of the global climate, affecting radiation in the stratosphere, the recovery of the ozone layer, and the storage of heat and carbon in the deep ocean. A tracer is a substance that has a small concentration and follows the flow of a fluid. Wildfire smoke can be a tracer; smoke from fires in the Western United States follows the jet stream, bringing air pollution all the way to the east coast in a large plume that can be seen from space. Carbon dioxide is a trace gas that has no appreciable chemical losses, so it can be used to examine the properties of the winds or currents that are transporting it. The relationships between different tracers have long been used to qualitatively describe winds and currents; for example, measurements of very high salt content and high temperature in the ocean demonstrate that the water started at the surface in the Mediterranean, even if the measurement is taken in the middle of the Atlantic. Just high temperature or high salt content would not lead to the same conclusion. This project involves developing and applying theory to use relationships between different tracers quantitatively to examine trends in the global patterns of winds in the stratosphere and currents in the ocean.<br/> <br/>Measurements of different tracers go back well over a century in the ocean and nearly 70 years in the stratosphere, and so the ability to use relationships between them to understand the winds and currents potentially unlocks a vast quantity of data to be analyzed in a new way that provides information about the history of global-scale winds and currents. This work will provide new insights into how these winds and currents affect radiation and climate by examining the storage of carbon in the deep ocean and the chemicals that set the rate of the recovery of the ozone layer. Three graduate students will be trained as part of this project. Tracers are one of the best ways to visualize the flow and are therefore excellent for learning about fluid motion. The PI will develop curricula that bring fluid experiments to a range of college-level classes with an inexpensive apparatus made of Lego components and a kitchen turntable. In addition, stratospheric science teaching materials, including a textbook and programming activities, will be developed and made available as part of these efforts.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To remedy these inequities, research is needed to understand educational practices and cues in the STEM learning environment, and their psychological impacts on students.  These practices and cues include what teachers, staff, and administrators say and do, their policies and instructional practices, their interactions with students, and the norms they set for students? interactions with one another.  These situational factors are important because they causally impact students' learning, motivation, achievement, and persistence in STEM fields.  Despite the national importance of successful and equitable STEM education, there is still great need for basic tools and infrastructure to support rigorous, scalable research within STEM learning environments.  However, a new generation of research infrastructure has recently begun to emerge, enabled by the digital transformation of education.  As teachers and schools increasingly use digital platforms for instruction, class assignments, sharing resources, student interaction, and data collection and storage, there is an opportunity to leverage these digital platforms to fill education research infrastructure gaps.  Terracotta is an emerging research tool that makes it possible to experimentally manipulate many of these capabilities of the digital learning environment, while also providing robust protections for student privacy and agency.  To ensure that Terracotta addresses the needs of high priority research studies, this Mid-scale Research Infrastructure Incubator project will convene a diverse network of researchers who study education, learning, and social equity, as well as technologists and stakeholders in education, and will identify consensus infrastructure requirements. <br/> <br/>Incubator members will receive training on cutting-edge findings about processes that foster equity in education and will collaboratively envision how Terracotta can develop into a national infrastructure that advances this research.  The project will occur in three phases: (1) Needs Assessment: Identifying high-impact research needs for examining the influence of situational and instructional cues on STEM outcomes; (2) Infrastructure Design: Co-creation of infrastructure solutions for filling the range of research needs identified in Phase 1; and (3) Synthesis: Integrating the incubator products into a consensus research infrastructure plan. In Phases 1 and 2, incubator members will meet at multi-day in-person convenings to identify research questions, and the corresponding infrastructure needed, to lead to greater STEM education equity. In Phase 3, the steering committee will synthesize incubator products into a coherent plan for national STEM education research infrastructure.  Additionally, the INTERACT incubator also makes active strides toward diversifying the STEM education research workforce, by constructing a community of racially and gender diverse researchers, stakeholders, and graduate trainees who are vested in the incubator?s products and who constitute the future of STEM education equity research.

Online hate has increased and arrives in waves; it is a deeply concerning problem that is negatively transforming the lives of internet users. Recent studies have demonstrated how online hate violates social media policies and describes the ramifications of these violations in the real world. Online hate is difficult to study scientifically. Sparse and biased samples of hate communications are available for computational analysis, especially when hate communications occur and spread suddenly. This project advances the frontiers of knowledge and our ability to defend against abd mitigate online hate. The project applies novel approaches to study waves of online hate, using new computational approaches to detect online hate policy violations and proposing new methods for moderation on social media platforms.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, the investigation is discovering and cataloging novel factors that characterize new waves of online hate. The categorization process is based on temporal and social measurement analyses of online hate communications. The project also is formulating new techniques to effectively discover linkages in social media streams. The key idea is to efficiently sample online hate datasets such that only samples that characterize new instances or forms of online hate are used for machine-learning training. The machine learning paradigm only needs a few samples to effectively learn to detect the new waves of online hate. The project also uses novel techniques to identify and track cross-platform transfers of online hate in user communities across different social media platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This solution is currently focused on cancer imaging applications, especially head and neck, lung and brain cancers. Neural networks are used in many areas of the human endeavor, and their use is expected to increase exponentially. These machine learning models do not provide a measure of confidence in the decisions and fail without warning. There are no solutions for addressing these issues except manually monitoring and reviewing the performance of these models after deployment. The proposed technology can integrate seamlessly with any machine learning model before or after deployment and output model confidence in the decision with minimal additional computational cost. The proposed technology will help artificial intelligence find its true potential in mission-critical areas. The proposed mechanisms for detecting performance degradation and model failure can provide a path to achieve the much-desired trustworthiness in artificial intelligence models. The applicability of the proposed technology encompasses various areas, including healthcare, transportation, cybersecurity, economics, environment, and financial services.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of a generalized framework that quantifies the performance and detects failure in all types of machine learning models, including convolutional neural networks and transformers. This framework does not require retraining of the original model and can be used as an out-of-the-box solution. This technique consists of different methods to identify the type of machine learning model and its output. This information is used to specify a fixed threshold or learn a dynamic one. These threshold values serve as a guide for identifying the performance degradation of the machine learning model. In the first case, the technology defines a fixed threshold value based on the model performance on the test dataset with a changing signal-to-noise ratio. The second method learns the threshold value using a shallow neural network. The proposed failure detection methods seamlessly integrate with the original machine learning model and abstain from making decisions when the model?s confidence is below the threshold. This technique, when used during the machine learning model training phase, can help improve model accuracy.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Currently, only 10-15% of patients undergoing surgery receive continuous blood pressure monitoring because such monitoring requires specialized skill to administer the invasive procedure and can also introduce potential complications. The remaining patients are monitored intermittently with a non-invasive blood pressure cuff, resulting in gaps in information between readings and potentially delayed response times. Rapid blood pressure drops are associated with poor patient outcomes such as organ damage/failure, post-surgical complications, and death. The success of this project has the potential to not only increase the number of surgical and critical care patients who receive continuous monitoring, improving quality of care and patient outcomes, but also to enable continuous blood pressure monitoring in other applications, such as in pre-eclampsia patients in obstetrics. This project also has commercial potential. With over 50 million surgeries performed in the US each year, the serviceable, addressable market is $2.5 billion per year. Expanded to the global market where over 230 million surgeries are performed annually, the total addressable market is over $11 billion.<br/><br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project develops a wireless, continuous, and non-invasive blood pressure monitoring device that can capture rapid fluctuations in blood pressure with high temporal resolution. Current technologies developed to address the unmet need for non-invasive, continuous blood pressure monitoring have been limited in their accuracy, cost, and ease-of-use. The research objectives to advance this project to commercial and clinical readiness are: device optimization through sensor improvement and algorithm development, form factor development for mechanical and electrical stability, and development of a smart calibration system for improved usability. Through iterative device design and testing in clinical environments, this project aims to tackle the long-standing challenges of continuous blood pressure monitoring, namely motion, calibration, and signal drift. The Phase II project outcome is a wearable, non-invasive, and continuous blood pressure monitoring device to be used in the operating room and intensive care unit. This device has the potential to not only empower clinicians with greater insight into patient condition, enabling rapid response and improved care in the clinical setting, but it can also be used to improve understanding of disease progression, treatment effectiveness, and patient stratification across demographics.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To establish points of comparison, judgment is elicited for the same sentences by native speakers, as well as those whose L1 and L2 are the L2 and L3 of the experimental group, respectively. The research design allows the researchers to tease apart the predictions of several existing hypotheses about factors that influence L3 acquisition.

These capabilities will reveal novel biological processes, enable new energy-efficient technologies, and decode quantum behavior that can drive new computing methods and novel materials. A diverse population of undergraduate and graduate students will be engaged in the scientific and project management aspects of this mid-scale research infrastructure development effort. The combination of infrastructure training and broad researcher access to transformative new instruments will serve the NSF mission priority to advance all fields of science and engineering.<br/><br/>The CXFEL is a novel instrument to produce sub-femtosecond coherent X-rays for analysis of a range of samples. CXFEL builds on the latest advances in laser technology and electron beam physics to produce a room-sized X-ray laser (roughly 10m long) with full coherence in time and space. The CXFEL will uniquely offer full control of the X-ray phase using electron-beam patterning that allows customized time-structure of the beam, e.g., attosecond pulses, very narrow linewidths, and extremely precise timing among multiple pulses with different colors. Multiple end-stations will be configured to support X-ray spectroscopy, small- and wide-angle X-ray scattering, coincident attosecond momentum imaging, and time-resolved X-ray crystallography for studies in biology, quantum materials, atomic and molecular science, and optical sciences.  During construction, sophisticated machine learning software will be integrated with the hardware to create highly flexible and efficient ultrafast science instruments that respond to NSF?s Big Ideas, including Midscale Research Infrastructure, Rules of Life, Quantum Leap, and Harnessing the Data Revolution. The software tools will help guide acquisition and analysis of large data sets, speeding up experiments and expanding capabilities.  The primary outcome of the CXFEL project is construction of a user-facility with instruments and end-stations, including validation of algorithms and experimental capabilities.

An adaptable blade with advanced control capabilities helps solve technical and scientific challenges as wind projects accelerate their move offshore, extending the physics of the larger turbines needed for future wind farms. Developing a high-fidelity modeling tool to design morphing blades capable of boosting energy production, reducing wear and tear, dampening vibration, improving stability, and reducing load effectively achieves two crucial goals.  These goals include accelerating the deployment of renewable energy with affordable electricity that is efficiently and economically extracted from wind and improving the loading and stability necessary for the development of floating wind farms capable of installation in challenging water depths and extreme weather. The technology proposed makes large turbines better at capturing wind in more locations to protect against volatile energy prices, generate jobs, and promote greater participation in the global energy transition for developed and developing countries alike. Furthermore, the blade technology resulting from this research provides opportunities for new manufacturing techniques and commercial applications in other industries such as aviation, automotive, and marine renewable energy.<br/><br/>This STTR Phase I project proposes to examine a high-fidelity model to support the design and control of an advanced wind turbine blade configuration with an adaptive twist angle distribution (TAD). Conventional control is generally applied to rotor torque to maximize wind capture, and thus production, below the rated wind speed. Above this speed, control shifts to the blade pitch angle to maintain full power. However, limitations in existing designs lead to trade-offs where wind capture or power production is relinquished to reduce loads, mitigate vibration, and improve stability. The actively adaptive TAD provides greater control capabilities and satisfies these objectives without trade-offs. A crucial goal of this research is the means to understand the complex aeroelastic and aerodynamic relationships with respect to the TAD. The technology is a high-fidelity model that simulates these dynamics and the aeroelastic performance in a reasonable amount of time. This model involves the development of a framework combining these dynamics and uses computational tools that leverage data analytics and machine learning. The technical result of the proposed work is the creation of a digital twin that enables effective design and robust control of highly sophisticated blades with adaptive TAD.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Humanitarian demining is the process where agencies (governmental or otherwise) survey a potentially hazardous area to detect, identify, and subsequently clear any explosive hazards (landmines or unexploded ordinance) in a post-conflict region. The goal of humanitarian demining is to release previously explosive-contaminated land back to impacted communities to allow the land to be used and developed without fear of injury and death caused by landmines and unexploded ordnance. The enormous variety of explosives, environments in which they lie, and conditions in which they may be found, create a multi-faceted problem that requires innovative technological solutions. This project is a demonstration of the powerful and wide-reaching capabilities of drones and machine learning in humanitarian mine action applications. The implementation of this technology will dramatically increase the rate and safety of demining, increasing the safety of demining operators, and allowing communities to reclaim previously inaccessible land for future development.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based on the development of an integrated artificial intelligence-assisted unmanned aerial vehicle drone survey platform that a demining agency could quickly and effectively use to perform initial wide-area surveys.  This technology will save money and time on subsequent demining activities in areas of critical contamination. The methods can be expanded to detect not only direct evidence of landmines and unexploded ordinances, but also indirect evidence such as explosion craters, minefield warning signs, or dead livestock potentially killed by explosives. Combining state-of-the-art deep learning technology, commercially available drones, and miniaturized optical sensors, this team created new solutions. This technology involves drone survey methods combined with innovative deep learning algorithms. The first step consists of integrating commercial visual light, thermal and multispectral drones to survey areas that are suspected to be contaminated with explosives. After the survey is complete, the deep learning method is used to generate the predicted coordinate locations of the explosives. In addition, a high-quality map of the suspected hazardous region is produced with each predicted explosive marked and labeled with its predicted class. The entire process takes place without using the internet, is user friendly, and can detect and classify most of the aerially-visible landmines and unexploded ordinances at a rate of 800 square meters per hour.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The narrative of the Poverty Point  site, with its abundant, far-reaching, and diverse tool stone acquisition network, has been characterized as enigmatic without fully testing the longevity of this pattern from a temporal-cultural perspective. In the past, identifying the origin of lithic artifacts relied on the subjective and often inaccurate use of visual identification, but more analytical instrumentation removes much of the uncertainty. In comparing raw material diversity among southeastern Middle and Late Archaic sites, possible patterns of regional cultural continuity or intransigence through time concerning the exchange of cryptocrystalline exotics and the treatment of debitage will emerge. Utilizing curated assemblages from sites of cultural significance minimizes the detrimental effects of excavation on cultural resources but requires a systematic approach to sampling to ensure comparability among archaeological artifact assemblages.<br/><br/>Examining Archaic chert resource networks is interdisciplinary relying on the fields of archaeology, geology, and mineralogy, as well as quantitative analyses, representing a significant undertaking into the extensive, yet under-researched, acquisition of chert resources by people at Poverty Point and related cultural sites. The research contributes to the wider public audience, engaging people with science and technology by producing information that will be shared with visitors to the Poverty Point World Heritage Site and made publicly available. This non-destructive research is a continuation of the first analytical chert provenance study of the Archaic period in the LMV, providing a template for other investigations of raw material procurement, mobility, and the organization of technology. The research will contribute to a greater public understanding of complex hunter-gatherers and provides data relevant to whether the people who built Poverty Point utilized the same chert resource networks as those who occupied the region during earlier cultural periods.

The color and electrical properties of metals like gold and silver change dramatically as they get smaller. People have used the color changes and electrical properties of ultrasmall metal clusters to make medical devices, environmental sensors, and electronic components. However, it is very difficult to control matter at very small size regimes. We recently showed how tiny protein fragments can actually cause metal clusters to assemble into larger wire-like structures. This is a key step to building larger structures that people can use. Our goal in this research is to use protein fragments to create functional devices. We will incubate these short protein fragments with small metallic clusters. Our preliminary data showed that the protein acts as a guide and can cause the metallic clusters to self-assemble into remarkably complex structures of an intermediate size (bigger than the source clusters but smaller than bulk metal). That is, we are using the protein guides to assemble tiny clusters of metals into wires. After doing controlled experiments to understand the mechanism, we will determine the limits of this technique, i.e., we will determine how big we can make the wires. We will then use the resulting wires to make a sensor that can quickly diagnose and discriminate between different respiratory viruses. Finally, we will use the color changes resulting from the sizes changes to train the next-generation of materials scientists. <br/><br/>PART 2:   TECHNICAL SUMMARY<br/><br/>Hierarchical plasmonic biomaterials are interesting because they are useful. These biomaterials are built from small nanoparticles that combine into larger micron-sized structures. As a result of their unique structure, hierarchical plasmonic biomaterials have tunable optical, electronic, and structural properties. These properties can then be harnessed for medical devices, environmental sensors, electronic components, etc. Thus, the long-term goal of this research is to develop theory and applications related to biologically-constructed hierarchical nanoparticles. More specifically, our preliminary work uses diffusion-limited aggregation in the presence of defined peptide sequences to build hierarchical silver biomaterials with a fractal snowflake-like design (see figures below). These fractal systems were constructed from ~30 nm silver nanospheres incubated with certain short peptides (5 ? 20 residues). We now seek funds to conduct additional studies to derive a coherent mechanistic understanding of how the peptide length, amino acid sequence, and nanoparticle surface so dramatically impacts biomaterial morphology. We hypothesize that the hierarchical assembly is driven by bridging interactions between the nanoparticle surface the peptide scaffold. To test this hypothesis, Objective #1 will study the structure/activity relationship of the peptide length and charge: We will monitor nanoparticle morphology as a function of peptide design. Objective #2 will perturb the nanoparticle surface chemistry to elucidate the role that surface ligands have on particle assembly into hierarchical structures. Objective #3 will build even larger biomaterials by combining multiple self-assemblies face-to-face?this work will lead to customized wires and lattices based on DNA-guided assembly. Objective #4 will deploy these insights for a practical sensor that discriminates between respiratory diseases via a simple color change. We also include objectives that use the colorimetric changes inherent to plasmonic materials to recruit and educate a new generation of materials scientists. Thus, the project outcomes are new knowledge and new materials to create hierarchical plasmonic biomaterials that benefit society as well as newly trained materials scientists.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Smart contracts are widely believed to have strong security guarantees as they are immutable once deployed, not even the owner of the contract can change its code. However, a new type of smart contract, namely upgradeable smart contract (USC), allows developers to upgrade the logic of their smart contracts and practically breaks the security assumption. This special type of smart contract has become increasingly prominent and has been adopted by many major companies (e.g., Compound Finance and Opensea.io). Despite the importance, there exists no comprehensive research that studies the status quo of USCs in the wild and even worse, the emerging security risks that are associated with upgradeability. This project conducts a series of novel studies to discern the upgradeability of smart contracts in the real world. Specifically, it answers three essential research questions regarding the importance of USCs in the current market, different design patterns and their strengths and weaknesses, and more importantly, the real-world security risks with USCs. <br/><br/>To do so, this project pioneers a practical static analysis-based approach to effectively detect USCs based on intrinsic characteristics, and perform further automatic behavior and security analyses. To differentiate USC design patterns, this project develops a complete taxonomy that can systematically characterize USCs at both syntactic and semantic levels.

Superconducting mechanism for simple metals, such as Sn and Al, was explained by the theory of Bardeen, Cooper and Schrieffer (BCS) in 1957.  However, since the discovery of cupper-oxide systems in 1986, many ""unconventional"" superconductors (USC) were found to exhibit signatures unexpected in BCS theory.  Many of them are in the proximity to materials showing Mott metal-insulator transitions (MIT).  Strong interplay between electric (charge) and magnetic (spin) interactions seems to be crucial for the USC and MIT phenomena.  By performing muon spin relaxation, neutron scattering and scanning-tunneling microscopy measurements on selected systems, and by interpreting the results using Uemura-plot phenomenology developed by the PI since 1989, the present project aims to elucidate charge-spin interplays and unveil essential mechanisms of USC and MIT.  The project also aims to clarify the role of dimensionality and topology on phase transitions of these systems and selected novel magnetic systems. Involving students and young researchers, these projects help develop human resources in international collaborations at major accelerator-based facilities.  <br/><br/>Technical abstract:<br/><br/>Emergent quantum materials, such as unconventional superconductor (SC), Mott transition, Skyrmion and topological systems, exhibit novel quantum phenomena based on intertwining interplays of spin, charge, geometry and topology. Muon spin relaxation (MuSR) is a strong probe for studying these systems, with unique sensitivity to superfluid density in SC's and dynamic spin fluctuations, static order parameter, volume fraction and local spin correlations in magnetic transitions. By performing MuSR studies in combination with complementary measurements by neutron scattering and Scanning Tunneling Microscopy (STM), the PI aims to test and clarify: (1) a hypothesis of highly entangled spin-charge gap, analogous to the magnetic resonance mode, existing in non-superconducting Mott transition systems Ba(Co,Ni)S2 and Ni(S,Se)2; (2) magnetic-field-induced change in the normal state of Hg1201 high-Tc cuprates; (3) effect of topology in dynamic critical behavior of MnSi and other Skyrimon systems; and (4) spin fluctuations in topological Weyl semimetal Co3(Sn,In)2S2 with Kagome lattice. The PI also integrate these experimental efforts with his phenomenology on unconventional SC's towards the ultimate goal to advance comprehensive understandings of unconventional superconductivity.  In addition, Frontiers of Condensed Matter Physics (FCMP) lectures and associated workshops organized by the PI facilitate motivated graduate students / researchers from over the world to study forefront CMP researches on superconductivity and magnetism with leading contributors.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This global diversity gradient is especially noticeable among trees. Forest plots measuring 0.25 km2 contain 10 tree species in subarctic Canada, between 10 and 70 tree species in the continental United States, and >1,200 tree species in Amazonia. Since Darwin and Wallace, biologists have hypothesized that environmental stress predominates in temperate and seasonal climates, but the stresses experienced by plants in warm, wet, tropical rainforests are dominated by their interactions with other organisms, including insect herbivores and microbial pathogens. Plants are thought to evolve chemical defenses against their enemies, and their enemies to evolve counters to these defenses, more rapidly in the tropics, resulting in greater variation in defensive chemistry among plant species in the tropics, and ultimately greater species diversity. These ideas have gone largely untested at large scales because of a lack of tools to study the astonishing diversity of plant chemistry. This study will overcome this historical obstacle to chemical ecology by taking advantage of recent innovations in metabolomics?the study of the chemical profiles of organisms. The scientists will examine species differences in chemical profiles, or metabolomes, for >2,000 tree and shrub species in 20 long-term forest plots ranging from subarctic Canada to the Amazon Rainforest, their effects on the growth and survival of individual trees, their contribution to the maintenance of diversity. The project will support two Ph.D. students from underrepresented groups at the University of Texas at Austin and Washington University in St. Louis, undergraduate research opportunities, and capacity building in the larger research community. Other broader impacts include offering workshops at international meetings and the creation of a publicly available metabolome database for the research community. These data will support future research at US Government-supported sites within the National Science Foundation?s National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and the Smithsonian Institution?s Forest Global Earth Observatory.<br/><br/>The researchers will couple recent innovations in ecological metabolomics with existing data on the diversity and dynamics of forest-tree communities that span large-scale gradients in climate, latitude, and tree-species diversity from boreal forest in Canada (11 species in 21 hectares [ha]) to tropical rainforest in Amazonia (>1,200 species in 25 ha). This project will leverage existing data on the growth, survival, and mapped distributions of more than 3,600 tree species in 20 large-scale forest-dynamics plots coordinated by the Smithsonian Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO) and San Diego Zoo Global, as well as existing metabolomics data from 13 forest plots. Building on these data, the researchers will collect and analyze leaves of 1,367 species in 7 new forest plots that represent unique climates and/or provide key seedling performance datasets. The researchers will combine metabolomics data, neighborhood demographic models, and theoretical simulations to determine i) how leaf-secondary chemistry shapes local species interactions within tree communities, ii) how the effects of leaf-secondary chemistry on local species interactions vary across latitudinal and climatic gradients, and iii) the importance of chemically mediated niche differences in maintaining species diversity across latitudinal and climatic gradients. Ultimately, the combination of long-term forest plots and novel techniques in metabolomics will provide unprecedented answers, in scope, scale, and substance, to questions that are fundamental to understanding Earth?s biodiversity. In addition to mentoring undergrad and graduate students, the researchers will lead a forest-metabolomics workshop at international meetings to train students and other scientists in the collection, analysis, and application of metabolomic data to community-scale ecology. The workshop will provide capacity building for early-career researchers from US and developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Finally, the project will generate a public database of metabolites for over 200 North American and over 2,000 Neotropical tree species, most of which are understudied tropical rainforest trees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The decompartmentalization of work and home is like to affect how members of the military engage in the work of remote warfare and to affect family relationships as households are less fully separated from military activities. To understand these dynamics, this doctoral dissertation project uses qualitative methods to investigate how the boundaries between home and work and between military and civilian life are being redrawn for service members and their families. The work advances our understanding of the dynamics of military operations as they spill over increasingly into home life. The project trains a graduate student in scientific cultural anthropology and disseminates results broadly to academic, non-academic, and stakeholder audiences. <br/><br/>The labor of warfare has always seeped in some ways into homelife, but remote warfare has made the boundaries between work and home and between military and civilian life blurrier than ever before. To understand how porosity in these boundaries impacts military operations, this doctoral dissertation uses semi-structured interviews and participant observation of service members and their families to investigate the following: 1) how military personnel share military experiences with their families; 2) whether and how conducting warfare from home affects the conduct and experience of military operations; and 3) how military personnel and families understand and experience the shifting boundaries between work and home.

Establishing circularity of critical materials can decease dependence on foreign sources while increasing domestic manufacturing of lithium-ion batteries, magnets, catalysts, and superalloys. As the world electrifies light- and heavy-duty vehicles and renewable energy resources increase, the need for battery materials is expected to quadruple over the next decade. Hydrometallurgical processes are highly nuanced and well-established; The configurations are nearly endless, especially when multiple recycle streams are incorporated.

Mathematical sensemaking in science focuses on students? ability to blend core disciplinary science ideas with cross-cutting mathematical concepts, such as patterns and proportions, while engaging in scientific practices such as computational thinking, making predictions, and reasoning from evidence.  Current visions for undergraduate STEM education stress the need to integrate i) key disciplinary ideas and ii) crosscutting concepts with iii) authentic scientific practices, resulting in what is called three-dimensional learning. This requires developing new assessments with the ability to detect when students engage in three-dimensional learning and reveal this to instructors. This project seeks to extend previous work to identify opportunities to observe mathematical sensemaking in science in the classroom.  The project plans to develop open-ended questions to explore undergraduate mathematical sensemaking in science using three dimensional learning assessments. This serves the goal of improving STEM education at the undergraduate level by providing engaging and authentic assessments capable of revealing student thinking. Findings from this project should help inform teaching practice in undergraduate STEM courses and help students foster computational thinking skills. <br/><br/>The project will target two aims. Aim 1 is to apply an evidence-centered design process to develop open-ended assessment items that elicit mathematical sensemaking in science (MaSS) and align with a three-dimensional learning (3DL) assessment framework. The evidence-centered design approach for the assessments will provide an opportunity to collect validity evidence throughout the process and allow development of similar items across disciplines. Assessment tasks and coding rubrics will be based on frameworks for 3DL and MaSS, and will be iteratively revised to elicit and categorize student MaSS. The project will conduct interviews with undergraduates to examine their MaSS while completing the assessment items, and with college faculty to ensure alignment with disciplinary topics and phenomena common in college courses. Aim 2 is to administer constructed response items across undergraduate science disciplines to explore how undergraduates engage in MaSS across biology, chemistry, and physics. The project will administer the assessment items from Aim 1 at a diverse set of undergraduate institutions to collect student responses. These responses will be used to establish evidence of the validity, reliability, and fairness of the items quantitatively. Further, the responses will be used to explore how undergraduates engage in MaSS in varied science disciplines. The project meets the need for developing rich, formative assessment items for undergraduate 3DL that reveal student thinking, which is essential for instruction aimed to foster MaSS. The project will also advance understanding of how undergraduates integrate thinking about key STEM concepts and mathematics across disciplines by following a 3DL assessment framework.

While they often support safety-critical system functions, they are usually implemented under strict cost/energy budgets, using Micro-Controller Units (MCUs) that lack security mechanisms akin to those available in general-purpose computers. Unsurprisingly, the insecurity of embedded software has already led to several attacks, including massive denial of service and large-scale exploits. Run-time attestation techniques aim to remotely detect Malware that compromises the execution of software on safety-critical MCUs. However, existent run-time attestation methods preclude MCUs from processing real-time events (e.g., physical inputs, arrival of network packets, or expiring timers) as soon as they occur. On the other hand, real embedded applications are highly dependent on such time-sensitive event processing. Motivated by this problem, this project's novelties are the design and implementation of run-time attestation techniques that can securely co-exist with the real-time needs of MCU applications. The project's broader significance and importance are to reconcile run-time attestation techniques with the needs of realistic applications, bringing run-time attestation closer to practical adoption. <br/><br/>This project develops novel run-time attestation methods to detect run-time attacks while considering the realistic needs of embedded applications. Our approach addresses a major shortcoming of all current run-time attestation techniques: their inability to work in tandem with asynchronous events via system interrupts. This project bridges this gap by (1) characterizing the conflict between existing run-time attestation techniques and embedded applications that must process asynchronous events via interrupts; and (2) rethinking run-time attestation designs to make them amenable to system interrupts while retaining all of their security guarantees. The aforementioned goals are approached from two complementary perspectives: legacy devices that are already manufactured and in which hardware modifications are unfeasible; and future devices, in which clean-slate run-time attestation designs (that include custom hardware changes) are feasible.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This global diversity gradient is especially noticeable among trees. Forest plots measuring 0.25 km2 contain 10 tree species in subarctic Canada, between 10 and 70 tree species in the continental United States, and >1,200 tree species in Amazonia. Since Darwin and Wallace, biologists have hypothesized that environmental stress predominates in temperate and seasonal climates, but the stresses experienced by plants in warm, wet, tropical rainforests are dominated by their interactions with other organisms, including insect herbivores and microbial pathogens. Plants are thought to evolve chemical defenses against their enemies, and their enemies to evolve counters to these defenses, more rapidly in the tropics, resulting in greater variation in defensive chemistry among plant species in the tropics, and ultimately greater species diversity. These ideas have gone largely untested at large scales because of a lack of tools to study the astonishing diversity of plant chemistry. This study will overcome this historical obstacle to chemical ecology by taking advantage of recent innovations in metabolomics?the study of the chemical profiles of organisms. The scientists will examine species differences in chemical profiles, or metabolomes, for >2,000 tree and shrub species in 20 long-term forest plots ranging from subarctic Canada to the Amazon Rainforest, their effects on the growth and survival of individual trees, their contribution to the maintenance of diversity. The project will support two Ph.D. students from underrepresented groups at the University of Texas at Austin and Washington University in St. Louis, undergraduate research opportunities, and capacity building in the larger research community. Other broader impacts include offering workshops at international meetings and the creation of a publicly available metabolome database for the research community. These data will support future research at US Government-supported sites within the National Science Foundation?s National Ecological Observatory Network (NEON) and the Smithsonian Institution?s Forest Global Earth Observatory.<br/><br/>The researchers will couple recent innovations in ecological metabolomics with existing data on the diversity and dynamics of forest-tree communities that span large-scale gradients in climate, latitude, and tree-species diversity from boreal forest in Canada (11 species in 21 hectares [ha]) to tropical rainforest in Amazonia (>1,200 species in 25 ha). This project will leverage existing data on the growth, survival, and mapped distributions of more than 3,600 tree species in 20 large-scale forest-dynamics plots coordinated by the Smithsonian Forest Global Earth Observatory (ForestGEO) and San Diego Zoo Global, as well as existing metabolomics data from 13 forest plots. Building on these data, the researchers will collect and analyze leaves of 1,367 species in 7 new forest plots that represent unique climates and/or provide key seedling performance datasets. The researchers will combine metabolomics data, neighborhood demographic models, and theoretical simulations to determine i) how leaf-secondary chemistry shapes local species interactions within tree communities, ii) how the effects of leaf-secondary chemistry on local species interactions vary across latitudinal and climatic gradients, and iii) the importance of chemically mediated niche differences in maintaining species diversity across latitudinal and climatic gradients. Ultimately, the combination of long-term forest plots and novel techniques in metabolomics will provide unprecedented answers, in scope, scale, and substance, to questions that are fundamental to understanding Earth?s biodiversity. In addition to mentoring undergrad and graduate students, the researchers will lead a forest-metabolomics workshop at international meetings to train students and other scientists in the collection, analysis, and application of metabolomic data to community-scale ecology. The workshop will provide capacity building for early-career researchers from US and developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America. Finally, the project will generate a public database of metabolites for over 200 North American and over 2,000 Neotropical tree species, most of which are understudied tropical rainforest trees.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The fluid in the eye is isolated from the rest of the body by a blood-ocular barrier, so obtaining blood work does not help for diagnosing most ocular problems. Testing of ocular fluid has been shown to decrease rates of blindness in cases of ocular infections. However, this procedure is under-utilized due to the flaws with the current method for collecting fluid. Because of this, ocular infections can be misdiagnosed and undertreated, which can lead to increased rates of vision loss. Additionally, ocular fluid is an untapped reservoir for emerging biomarkers which has created an unmet need for better tools to collect this fluid. This project will result in a new product that can be used to collect ocular fluid for analyses that will guide treatment of some of the most common sight-threatening conditions including macular degeneration, glaucoma, and diabetes. This technology will open a new frontier in ocular diagnosis and improve vision outcomes for patients. <br/> <br/>This Small Business Innovation Research (SBIR) Phase II project is focused on fabricating a new medical device for ocular fluid biopsies. This project will create an instrument that is specifically designed to collect of fluid from the front of the eye.

This research will also investigate the fluid dynamics of collection with the integration of a microfluidic chamber and specialized collection system that is designed to handle small fluid volumes. A significant limitation of the current procedure is that the fluid volumes collected are small and the current method leads to fluid loss and inaccurate results. Additional development will evaluate advanced engineering features to connect the device for drug delivery. The expected outcome of this research is an innovative surgical tool that will enable ophthalmologists to perform ocular fluid biopsies more reliably and achieve better results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

There is increasing evidence that CRCs are correlated with cancer type, staging, treatment response, minimal residual disease, and overall disease progression. However, in a typical blood sample, there are over 7 million blood artifacts with very few CRCs present.  Current techniques to analyze CRCs are expensive, lengthy, and are limited in automation.  To meet project sensitivity, specificity, and runtime requirements, the AI image analysis will be further optimized to:  1) find CRCs, 2) discriminate against false positives, and 3) classify CRCs into clinically relevant types.

They wear out, require regular maintenance, and increase the cost of small computing devices. Fueled by recent advances, a fledgling community of researchers has begun developing batteryless computing devices that cost less, do not need to be charged, are powered by harvested energy, and are more sustainable than their traditional counterparts. In this community, research opportunities are both abundant and challenging, and new researchers from diverse backgrounds are needed if the community is to grow. Unfortunately, new researchers face a steep learning curve, technical design challenges, and gaps in educational materials. Worse, most of the community?s core hardware and software tools and computing platforms are poorly documented, difficult to use, and not commercially available. This project?s goal is to help the batteryless computing community grow by removing these barriers. The project aims to accomplish this by creating an online community research hub that brings together essential digital artifacts and information from community members and a collection of community hardware devices --development, testing, and experimentation tools and platforms-- that will be manufactured and made available to the<br/>community in the form of starter kits for new researchers interested in joining the community.<br/><br/>Ultimately, low-cost sensors and other computing devices that can operate for decades without batteries and regular maintenance will reduce the environmental cost of the Internet of Things and have a profound impact on the national economy by opening up new opportunities in healthcare, agriculture, transportation, space exploration, and other scientific fields that require long-term data gathering. This project?s community hub and inventory will expand public access to new hardware and software designs, artifacts, and educational materials. Furthermore, the project directly involves undergraduate and graduate students, expanding the supply of scientists educated in this important, emerging research area. This project will help past and future research results transition into public use, accelerate research progress, and encourage new researchers from many traditionally-separate computing fields to apply their expertise to critical scientific questions and challenges, like improving the security of unreliably-powered computing devices, enabling effective wireless communication in spite of intermittent failures, and bringing modern machine learning techniques to unpredictable low-power computing environments.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Recent advances in web-based software now make it possible for taxonomic experts to receive greater professional recognition and citation of their digitized biological specimens and identifications. Use of these software tools can increase the visibility of scientists as well as modernize the professional rewards system to support the development of taxonomic expertise. However, creating a self-sustaining cycle of specimen attribution and citation that leverages this new software requires greater awareness by collections-based researchers and cultural change in how taxonomic expertise is credited. At the heart of this change is ensuring that the names of the people who collect and identify biological research specimens are disambiguated and associated with globally unique identifiers. Accurate people-data are an essential part of the vision for an extended specimen network because they link groups of specimens across institutions and uncover events in the history of science.

According to the National Youth Tobacco Survey in 2020, 33.8% of U.S. middle and high school students report that they have been exposed to secondhand ENDS aerosols in indoor spaces. Despite extensive studies on aerosols directly generated from the ENDS mouthpieces, the properties of secondhand ENDS aerosols are insufficiently understood because these aerosols need to be generated by human subjects using ENDS devices. The use of human subjects is very limited, introduces uncertainty due to uncontrolled other variables (e.g., existing diseases, lung functions, and smoking habits), and raises ethical concerns. The knowledge gaps caused by this lack of data lead to confusion and potential delays in regulating ENDS usage in indoor environments. This research aims to examine the physical, chemical, and toxicological properties of secondhand ENDS aerosols generated from a simulated respiratory system recently developed by the research team. The successful completion of this project will benefit society through the development of new knowledge in understanding the environmental and health impact of secondhand ENDS aerosols. Further benefits to society will be achieved through student education, training, and public outreach. STEM training will be enhanced through integration of research findings into course modules, participation of researchers in K-12 summer science camps, and a partnership with local public library to disseminate the project findings to the public. <br/> <br/>Due to the limited data on the properties of secondhand ENDS aerosols, several fundamental questions are still not answered: 1) What are the typical size distributions of secondhand ENDS aerosols, and how do they evolve under controlled environmental factors? 2) Will secondhand ENDS aerosols in actual indoor environments induce oxidative stress and cytotoxicity? 3) What are the roles of metals and flavorings in determining the size distribution and toxic effect of secondhand ENDS aerosols? This project proposes to answer these questions by conducting experiments in a walk-in environmental chamber and an experimental house to relate measurements to real-world indoor environments. An array of online and offline measurement and modeling techniques will be deployed in this study to examine the physical, chemical, and toxicological properties of secondhand ENDS aerosols in realistic indoor environments. The collected data will be used to establish an aerosol dynamics model to predict the evolution of secondhand ENDS aerosols under the influence of evaporation, coagulation, wall deposition, and ventilation. This work has the potential to produce a transformative understanding of the behavior and control of indoor secondhand ENDS aerosols.

It is well known that extreme temperatures such as heatwaves have detrimental impacts on crop production and biodiversity. However, even smaller increases in ambient temperatures would dramatically change the growth and development of various plant species. These temperature-induced changes in the growth speed of organs (e.g., stem and roots), biomass, flowering time, the rate of photosynthesis, and the efficiency of water usage, significant impact crop yield and fitness. However, the precise mechanisms by which plants sense and respond to moderately increased, nonstressful (warm) temperatures are still unclear. The long-term goal of the proposed project is to elucidate the regulatory mechanisms by which warm temperatures trigger the expression of critical genes whose products contribute to the morphological and architectural changes in land plants. To achieve this goal, innovative technologies have been developed or adapted to examine the spatiotemporal functions and structure-function relationships of critical transcriptional regulators and their co-factors in thermosensory growth. Understanding these mechanisms is crucial for us to design and breed climate-resilient crops, potentially reducing the adverse effects of global warming on crop productivity and food security. The success of the project will also help train next-generation scientists from high school to graduate levels in performing cutting-edge research. <br/><br/>Different from the stress responses triggered by extreme temperatures, plant responses to nonstressful ambient temperature fluctuations require unique machinery. Among the discovered components, thermosensory transcription factors (TTFs) play primary roles in warm-temperature-induced hypocotyl (embryonic stem) growth, a process termed thermomorphogenesis. Among the identified TTF families, PIF4 plays a pivotal role in modulating thermomorphogenetic growth. Warm temperatures activate PIF4 transcription through a yet unknown mechanism, and accumulated PIF4 promotes hypocotyl growth by activating key genes involved in the biosynthesis of and response to the growth hormone auxin. The PI discovered HEMERA (HMR) as a coactivator of PIF4 in activating the thermoresponsive gene expression. Although HMR is required for PIF4 activity and protein stability at warm temperatures, how these regulations are achieved remains elusive. Through forward and reverse genetic approaches and bioinformatic analyses, the PI?s group has identified multiple factors that may regulate PIF4 expression, activity, and protein stability upon temperature elevations. The proposed research will uncover PIF4-mediated thermomorphogenetic mechanisms and transcriptional regulatory networks formed by PIF4 and other TTF families. The integrated educational plan will improve STEM preparedness at the University of Mississippi and across the state of Mississippi and includes efforts to 1) enhance undergraduate and graduate education in plant molecular genetics and physiology at UM; 2) develop a plant phenomics and molecular genetics summer research program for underrepresented minority students at UM and HBCUs; 3) develop a plant molecular biology summer research program for high school and community college students with disadvantaged backgrounds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Addressing these problems is the focus of a great deal of research. However, the solutions being developed are often complex, and the proofs that they are correct involve subtle mathematical arguments. These complexities make it possible for errors to arise, particularly in the translation from theoretical algorithms into executable programs. This project addresses these issues by developing machine-checked proofs of correctness for ML systems. The project's novelty is in an approach for making this feasible by proving the correctness of a smaller, simpler program called an auditor, which is designed to check and control the output of a complex ML system. The expected impact of this project is a re-usable framework for verifying these auditors, as well as educational material on constructing machine-checked proofs about randomized algorithms.<br/><br/>The technique of verifying an auditing algorithm has been successfully applied in other areas of verification, such as compiler correctness and security sandboxing. However, despite successes in these other domains, pursuing this approach in the context of ML systems raises new challenges. First, proofs of correctness for ML systems often involve complex probabilistic arguments, so that machine-checked libraries of results from measure-theoretic probability theory are needed. Second, specifying the behavior of these systems in a theorem prover is difficult, particularly because auditing algorithms are often higher-order, meaning that their specification is parameterized by the underlying algorithms whose behavior they are checking. The project builds on earlier experience developing a library for discrete probability theory for verifying randomized algorithms and data structures. In the course of developing the framework and verifying example auditing algorithms, the investigator addresses additional challenges about structuring these correctness proofs in a modular way, so that auditors can be re-used and composed together to enforce multiple types of correctness properties.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although there is much research on bullying and friendship, it is rare to find studies that (1) investigate multiple online and in-person locations where bullying occurs and friends interact; (2) contrast the impact of bullying and friendship experiences that occur during the summer and the school year; and (3) compare the impact of bullying and friendship experiences that occur in different locations and different times (e.g., bullying that occurs during the week versus the weekend, during the school year versus the summer). Research conducted during the summer months is especially rare as is work that fully captures the online worlds in which youth reside today. This project is among the first to thoroughly evaluate how location (both online and in-person locations) and time (summer months and the school year) impacts young adolescents? friendship and bullying experiences and their impact on psychological health. <br/><br/>The study design entails online data collection via survey and daily diaries from 300 socioeconomically and ethnically diverse young adolescents at three time-points during a single school year and summer. There are three aims. The first aim evaluates the features of adolescent friendship and bullying experiences in different locations and during different time periods. The second aim tests whether the impact of such friendship and bullying experiences on positive and negative psychological outcomes depend on the location and time during which they occur. The third aim examines effects of gender, socio-economic status, and ethnicity on the peer experiences. The work captures important contextual differences in the features and impact of adolescents? friendship and bullying experiences.

Some of these noncoding regions are transcribed to produce long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) that are processed similarly to protein-encoding messenger RNAs. Although they are often found only at low amounts within a cell, lncRNAs have been implicated in a myriad of biological processes including cell growth and survival, cell identity and environmental interactions, as well as numerous human and animal diseases. The next frontier will be to tap into the biotechnology potentially inherent to these lncRNAs. This project will use a synthetic, ?understanding by building? approach to rationally design and use lncRNAs to control large swaths of chromosomal DNA. Broad utility will be demonstrated by using this new RNA technology in human cells and in yeast (fungi). Engineering lncRNAs to control their activity will not only contribute to fundamental understanding of these enigmatic RNAs, but also tap the vast potential to generate useful biomolecules in agricultural and medical applications across species. The project includes uniquely tailored programming to support STEM workforce development for participants ranging from high school students to postdoctoral fellows. New virtual and hands-on activities focused on RNA biology will be integrated with successful STEM outreach programs to ensure strong impact.<br/><br/>This project seeks to define the minimal features that are required for large-scale silencing mediated by lncRNA, building off of the well-characterized Xic locus and its associated lncRNA, Xist, which is responsible for silencing one of the X chromosomes in female mammals and marsupials. The ultimate goal is to gain fundamental understanding of the mechanisms by which lncRNAs can exert silencing effects at a chromosomal scale despite being expressed at a low level in the cell. To tackle this, the investigators will first test the effects of different repeats on silencing ability in a mammalian cell culture system. They will then attempt to silence autosomal loci by integrating synthetic lncRNAs into other chromosomes, or via CRISPR-based targeting. We will use these data to parameterize mathematical models to better understand the dynamics and limitations of the silencing process. They will also create a stand-alone silencing system in haploid yeast cells using components of the Xist system. This will enable detailed genetic manipulations to further test and optimize the silencing system using the power of yeast genetics. Finally, the project will use the data to guide rational design of synthetic silencing systems that can be readily deployed in mammalian cells to achieve targeted and tunable silencing. Overall, the investigators expect to push the boundaries of the current understanding of lncRNA functions in the nucleus, with anticipated outcomes to include defining the minimal components and lncRNA levels required for stable and specific epigenetic regulation. By reconstituting functional components from the ground-up, they expect to validate, challenge, and/or expand fundamental mechanics involving RNAs. Given that tunable lncRNA modulation could be a broadly applicable biotechnology, this work has exciting implications for bioengineering.<br/><br/>This collaborative project resulted from an NSF-sponsored Ideas Lab.

There is a critical need for sustainable cooling solutions that provide an alternative to hydrofluorocarbon-based refrigerants that rely on carbon dioxide (CO2)-emitting systems. This project seeks to develop a Hydrologic Open Cooling System (HOCS) that can maintain cooling chambers at 1.5-5C utilizing 10% or less of the electrical power of conventional systems. This project unlocks environmental heat as an energy reservoir and offsets significant energy costs of conventional cooling systems. The technology can support highly efficient refrigeration at a fraction of the operational cost and electrical demand of traditional systems. Adoption of this cooling technology by small- to mid-size supermarkets would enable significant cost savings for electricity. On a broader scale, widespread implementation of this innovation across a variety of refrigeration applications would reduce greenhouse gas emissions and energy consumption, meeting the need for sustainable technologies to support food and energy security while upholding climate goals.<br/><br/>This SBIR Phase I project develops a renewable, closed container cooling system incorporating a rechargeable vacuum insulation and a novel two-stage heat pump. This project involves 1) developing a rechargeable vacuum insulation technology that does not use vacuum pumps; 2) creating a modified dewar connected to a fully renewable cooling system enabling cooled inner chambers; and 3) evaluating the ability to use environmental heat to restore the solutions that power the cooling system allowing their reuse. The novel heat pump technology is based on two asynchronous stages: the first utilizes concentration gradients as a driving mechanism enabling thermal transfer, while the second uses environmental heat to re-concentrate saline solutions after dilution during stage one. Together, these two stages enable cooling of a closed container. The project will examine system configurations able to generate large thermal gradients, enabling maintenance of 1.5-5C temperatures within the dewar. Advantages of this system include 1) the system?s ability to cool continues in the absence of electricity making it resilient to power outages from itinerant weather, wildfires, and earthquakes; 2) lossless storage of cooling capacity; and 3) significantly reducing the greenhouse gas footprint compared to conventional refrigeration.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet survey data often indicates that a majority of citizens in authoritarian regimes continue to support the leader's military operations. To understand authoritarian leader's strategies and the domestic implications of these strategic actions, it is crucial to study how the population perceives the war and how it reacts to developments in real time. The Watcher Tracking Survey is a daily, nationally representative survey of public opinion in an authoritarian state that is involved in an external war. The researchers monitor changes in public attitudes toward a series of political issues related to the war in and political developments inside the state. They also use experimental designs to understand how the government?s propaganda and disinformation campaigns affect citizens? attitudes and beliefs. Preliminary data suggest that state media outlets are highly effective at spreading false narratives within the population, including online. The Watcher survey has the following Broader Impacts (1) the project provides crucial and real-time information on the state and direction of domestic public opinion in an authoritarian state in a time of war, (2) it sheds light on the effectiveness of state propaganda and disinformation?a major national security concern, and (3) it generates a uniquely large and fine-grained dataset for policymakers and scholars of authoritarian politics. <br/><br/>Scholars still have a weak understanding of the mechanisms by which an authoritarian government shapes public opinion and maintains support, particularly during moments of crisis like external war. Previous public opinion surveys often show that citizens in authoritarian countries support their government's military operations. Yet the infrequency of these surveys made it difficult to draw conclusions about the causes and consequences of changes in public opinion in these countries. To better isolate the effects of individual events and media narratives, the PIs launched the Watcher Tracking Survey, a daily, nationally representative survey of political attitudes and beliefs. The Watcher survey tracks key political indicators over time and uses survey experiments to assess the effects of unfolding propaganda narratives. This method of studying public opinion is more dynamic than traditional surveys, as the treatments respondents receive (e.g., shifting propaganda narratives and military developments) are not predetermined, but rather emerge organically as the war develops. The researchers extend their data collection through 2023 and use a sample size to 500 respondents that enables them to detect shifts in public opinion more precisely. This research makes important contributions to scholarship on topics related to censorship, propaganda, and public opinion in authoritarian regimes. The Watcher data shed light on the mechanisms behind state propaganda and its effects on citizen attitudes. In turn, the research helps scholars understand better how autocrats sustain public support for high-cost endeavors like military campaigns.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Many classical ncRNAs play fundamental roles in biology including translation (tRNAs, rRNAs), splicing (snRNAs), post-transcriptional gene regulation (miRNAs), and many other biological processes. While these known ncRNAs are important for all life, they may be just the tip of the ncRNA iceberg. In fact, we expect that there are many ncRNA classes that remain uncharacterized. These are referred to as the ?dark matter? of the genome because we don?t know what biological roles they may play. In parallel, protein studies have determined that thousands of human proteins bind to RNA. Yet it remains unknown how many of these RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with ncRNAs, and which specific ncRNAs they might interact with. Our goal is to tackle both problems using very large-scale RNA-protein binding assays combined with computational analysis to uncover new classes of ncRNAs en masse. We will identify specific groups of RNAs that interact strongly with RBPs, develop models that define interaction specificity, and classification systems to predict interactions from sequence and structural data. We will also create a web-accessible database of our findings, allowing anyone to access the data and train undergraduates. We expect to reveal the biological functions of novel ncRNA classes, which will lay the foundation for biotechnology development.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, global RNA-centric proteomics methods like crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and related approaches have enabled unprecedented exploration of RNA-protein interactions. These efforts have vastly expanded the number of identified RBPs, with >4,000 human proteins (~20% of the human proteome) currently annotated as ?RNA-binding? by UniProt. However, because CLIP approaches can only map a single protein at a time, it is challenging to explore the thousands of annotated RBPs. As a result, consortium efforts like ENCODE are time-consuming and expensive, and have been limited to mapping a fraction of the RBPs in the human proteome. Thus, the creation of a comprehensive RBP-ncRNA interactome is near impossible with current approaches. We will use a newly developed, highly multiplexed approach to generate transcriptome-wide measurements across hundreds of RBPs in a single experiment. We will combine this with cutting edge computational and evolutionary strategies to uncover and classify novel classes of ncRNAs en masse. Our goal is to comprehensively discover and characterize novel classes of ncRNAs in the human transcriptome and assess their phylogeny in a way that is impossible using existing methods. To achieve this goal, we will develop novel experimental methods and integrative computational pipelines that will systematically identify novel classes of ncRNAs by combining both known and novel RNA-protein interactions and uncover clusters of multivalent interactions. We will identify conserved sequence and structural motifs, and evolutionary patterns specific to the novel classes, and develop computational systems to recognize members of the novel classes from these data.<br/><br/>This award was the result of an Ideas Lab that was co-sponsored by the four divisions in the NSF Directorate of Biological Sciences.

The project will accomplish this through a series of virtual summer workshops for psychology instructors who will learn how to teach students to conduct research by having students complete their own study from start to finish. The workshop series would introduce instructors to the Collaborative Replication and Education Project (CREP), a group that supports direct replication of published work by encouraging instructors to have students conduct these replication studies in their courses. Replication is a hallmark of good science, and work that supports replication through education is a priority for the National Science Foundation. Additionally, the field benefits from direct replication of published work and students are excellent candidates to carry out direct replication, as demonstrated by recent calls for students to engage in this work for their projects and theses (Quintana, 2021). The proposed workshops will take an existing system for student replications, CREP, and provide instructors time and support in developing teaching materials and preparing their courses to use this approach. <br/><br/>This series of workshops for undergraduate psychology faculty will be held virtually in Summer 2023 and will be delivered to up to 14 participants. The workshops will introduce CREP and demonstrate how it can be used in the context of courses, and then provide resources to support instructors in teaching students how to write meaningful extension hypotheses related to diversity, equity, inclusion, and access. During the series, the facilitators will meet with instructors individually to assist in tailoring each instructor?s work to their specific institution and students. Participants will contribute to a teaching manual for CREP projects and, following the workshop series, will also be invited to contribute to a manuscript related to this manual and their experiences teaching with CREP. Teaching materials and select workshop recordings will be available for other instructors. This project will therefore not only impact these 14 instructors and their students, but also any other instructor who is interested in adopting these projects in the future.

Mathematical sensemaking in science focuses on students? ability to blend core disciplinary science ideas with cross-cutting mathematical concepts, such as patterns and proportions, while engaging in scientific practices such as computational thinking, making predictions, and reasoning from evidence.  Current visions for undergraduate STEM education stress the need to integrate i) key disciplinary ideas and ii) crosscutting concepts with iii) authentic scientific practices, resulting in what is called three-dimensional learning. This requires developing new assessments with the ability to detect when students engage in three-dimensional learning and reveal this to instructors. This project seeks to extend previous work to identify opportunities to observe mathematical sensemaking in science in the classroom.  The project plans to develop open-ended questions to explore undergraduate mathematical sensemaking in science using three dimensional learning assessments. This serves the goal of improving STEM education at the undergraduate level by providing engaging and authentic assessments capable of revealing student thinking. Findings from this project should help inform teaching practice in undergraduate STEM courses and help students foster computational thinking skills. <br/><br/>The project will target two aims. Aim 1 is to apply an evidence-centered design process to develop open-ended assessment items that elicit mathematical sensemaking in science (MaSS) and align with a three-dimensional learning (3DL) assessment framework. The evidence-centered design approach for the assessments will provide an opportunity to collect validity evidence throughout the process and allow development of similar items across disciplines. Assessment tasks and coding rubrics will be based on frameworks for 3DL and MaSS, and will be iteratively revised to elicit and categorize student MaSS. The project will conduct interviews with undergraduates to examine their MaSS while completing the assessment items, and with college faculty to ensure alignment with disciplinary topics and phenomena common in college courses. Aim 2 is to administer constructed response items across undergraduate science disciplines to explore how undergraduates engage in MaSS across biology, chemistry, and physics. The project will administer the assessment items from Aim 1 at a diverse set of undergraduate institutions to collect student responses. These responses will be used to establish evidence of the validity, reliability, and fairness of the items quantitatively. Further, the responses will be used to explore how undergraduates engage in MaSS in varied science disciplines. The project meets the need for developing rich, formative assessment items for undergraduate 3DL that reveal student thinking, which is essential for instruction aimed to foster MaSS. The project will also advance understanding of how undergraduates integrate thinking about key STEM concepts and mathematics across disciplines by following a 3DL assessment framework.

They prevent exposure of the rest of the body to these toxic drugs. Penetrating the tumor is difficult. Understanding the factors that govern the behavior of drug nanocarriers within the tumor could help improve delivery. One strategy to improve delivery has been to try digesting the matrix material surrounding tumors. The enzymes used are referred to as matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs). Unfortunately, MMPs can be toxic to surrounding cells and tissue.  The major objective of this research is to create ?smart? MMPs whose activity is specific for tumor matrix material only.  Outreach and educational efforts are designed to attract students to careers in engineering and improve technological literacy. Pre-college research internships, drug delivery teaching modules for a local middle school, and new course modules in protein engineering and drug delivery are planned.<br/><br/>Nanocarriers offer numerous potential benefits in drug delivery. These include their abilities to precisely target drug delivery, to control release, extend circulation time within the body, and offer stimulus-responsive features. Poor penetration caused by the features of the tumor stroma/matrix is cited as a primary challenge to drug delivery effectiveness. This project fuses diverse expertise in synthetic biology/protein engineering and drug delivery/biomaterials to create tumor-actuatable pro-MMPs and uncover mechanisms governing their site-selective unmasking, proteolytic activity, and capacity to enhance nanocarrier transport within tumor-relevant extracellular matrix.  Certain MMPs (MMP-9 for example) have elevated concentrations in tumor microenvironments. Synthetic pro-MMPs that are conditionally activated by the elevated MMPs will be designed. The ability of these conditional pro-MMPs to provide MMP-specific mobility enhancements to protein nanostructures will be evaluated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Research Partnership (PFI-RP) project is to enable the automotive industry to make battery-powered electric vehicles (BEVs) more affordable and with a longer driving range. This project will support the transition from fossil fuels to clean electric energy. Reduced costs and improved performance in terms of higher efficiency and longer driving range will accelerate the adoption of the BEV technology. The project will also create a unique partnership with an automotive industry leader that will train the next generation technical and entrepreneurship leaders to lead the US automotive industry. The outreach efforts through student competitions and the Engineer Your World high school engineering program will broaden the participation of a diverse student population. <br/><br/>The proposed project is based on a disruptive battery-inverter architecture. Today?s battery in a BEV is a high voltage system based on series connection of many low voltage battery cells. In such architecture, all cells must perform together as a whole and any non-performing cell degrades the whole system?s performance and increases the cost due to the need for complicated management and mitigation components. The proposed project addresses this issue by allowing battery cells to operate almost independently based on their state of the health and state of charge. This architecture can substantially extend the overall battery life, effectively reducing the system cost. The novel inverter can also achieve much higher power conversion and motor efficiency, further extending the drive range of the BEVs.  The project will develop a prototype system that will be tested to verify the thermal and electrical performance of the battery-inverter system and its suitability to be implemented in future BEV platforms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Yet, the genetic and developmental changes that cause body size evolution remain unknown. The proposed work aims to address this problem by harnessing both long-established and cutting-edge genetic techniques in closely-related roundworm species with drastically different body sizes to identify the causes of body size variation. This work is important because we know larger roundworm species have larger cells than those of smaller species, and when the processes regulating cell size go awry, diseases such as cancer emerge. This work then has the potential to discover novel genes that control cell size and thus potential novel targets for cancer therapeutics. Beyond this, the research work described above will be integrated with multiple, established educational initiatives in the state of Oklahoma including: 1) The University of Oklahoma?s four-year undergraduate research experience program; 2) A multi-year summer research program for undergraduates; 3) A research experience for high school students summer program; and 4) A graduate-student led summer coding workshop. Additionally, an undergraduate developmental biology laboratory course will be developed where students will participate in the original research activities described above. The proposed work not only aims to make significant advances in understanding the evolution of body size and the genes underlying cell size variation, but this work also aims to connect multiple educational efforts with these research efforts to simultaneously advance both scientific knowledge and societal good.<br/><br/>Understanding how developmental systems evolve to promote phenotypic diversity is a fundamental goal of biology. These systems include and regulate the morphogenetic fields, signaling factors, and differentiation decisions essential for the construction and ultimate form of a multicellular organism. Despite this, while gene regulatory networks have been painstakingly described in a handful of model systems, network architecture change is rarely connected to morphological divergence among species. How does genetic variation change developmental processes to cause divergent phenotypes? Over forty years of C. elegans genetics has revealed the developmental details of a canonical TGF-? signaling network that regulates body size in this species. C. inopinata is the sister species of C. elegans, and it is nearly twice as long in size as its highly-studied close relative. Here, the vast background knowledge of a long-standing model system will be integrated with a comparative approach to understand how network modification causes phenotypic divergence. This work will include: 1) The perturbation of TGF-? pathway activity in two species to determine how ancestral body size genes evolve to promote cell size divergence; 2) The generation and mapping of large-effect body size mutations in C. inopinata to discover novel genes driving cell size regulation; and 3) The characterization of tissue-specific cell size variation in mutants across development in two species. Not only will this work map genotypes to organismal phenotypes such as body size, but it will also show how genotypes influence cellular phenotypes to cause the emergence of such organismal phenotypes. <br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the BIO-IOS-Developmental Systems Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A vital obstacle that impedes the development of the electric, connected, and autonomous vehicle system is the shortage of synergy research from interdisciplinary domains, such as electric vehicle design, intelligent autonomous systems, and V2X communication technologies. In coping with this challenge, this project will build the Center of Electric, Connected, and Autonomous Technologies for Mobility (eCAT). eCAT will not only serve as an apparatus of academic researchers collaborating with industry on problems of high national and international importance but also provides industry partners the opportunities to access the most advanced synergistic  research produced by a diverse group of researchers.<br/><br/>The establishment of eCAT is expected to initiate and accelerate the transformation of mobility methods from conventional vehicles to eCAVs by creating innovative electric, connected, and autonomous technologies. This requires the evolution of a new collaboration paradigm for the transportation industry by developing long-term partnerships among industry, academia, and government. The eCAT Wayne State University (eCAT-WSU) Site will serve as the lead Site for eCAT and will lead the coordination and management of the Center. Research at the eCAT-WSU Site will focus on electrification, real-time edge/vehicle computing systems, safety, and smart infrastructure. <br/><br/>Building this eCAT Center will constitute a major technological breakthrough toward realizing fully autonomous electric vehicles in our daily life. In particular, the center will advance the science and technologies of eCAVs and accelerate knowledge and intellectual property transfer between academia and industry through our collaborative partnerships. The talent and expertise of center members (including both the PIs and the industry partners) are fused together to enhance the center?s core competence. The innovations and techniques developed via eCAT will effectively fulfill the urgent demands of autonomous vehicles for hardware and software support. <br/><br/>Data obtained from this project will include experimental, computational, text-based, and/or curricular data. All data products will be retained for a minimum of three years after the conclusion of the award or three years after public release (publication), whichever is later. eCAT-WSU will have password-protected shared network drives to facilitate data sharing within the teams, with collaborators, and with anyone in the community interested in the NSF-funded data.

Yet it remains unknown how many of these RNA binding proteins (RBPs) interact with ncRNAs, and which specific ncRNAs they might interact with. Our goal is to tackle both problems using very large-scale RNA-protein binding assays combined with computational analysis to uncover new classes of ncRNAs en masse. We will identify specific groups of RNAs that interact strongly with RBPs, develop models that define interaction specificity, and classification systems to predict interactions from sequence and structural data. We will also create a web-accessible database of our findings, allowing anyone to access the data and train undergraduates. We expect to reveal the biological functions of novel ncRNA classes, which will lay the foundation for biotechnology development.<br/><br/>Over the past decade, global RNA-centric proteomics methods like crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and related approaches have enabled unprecedented exploration of RNA-protein interactions. These efforts have vastly expanded the number of identified RBPs, with >4,000 human proteins (~20% of the human proteome) currently annotated as ?RNA-binding? by UniProt. However, because CLIP approaches can only map a single protein at a time, it is challenging to explore the thousands of annotated RBPs. As a result, consortium efforts like ENCODE are time-consuming and expensive, and have been limited to mapping a fraction of the RBPs in the human proteome. Thus, the creation of a comprehensive RBP-ncRNA interactome is near impossible with current approaches. We will use a newly developed, highly multiplexed approach to generate transcriptome-wide measurements across hundreds of RBPs in a single experiment. We will combine this with cutting edge computational and evolutionary strategies to uncover and classify novel classes of ncRNAs en masse. Our goal is to comprehensively discover and characterize novel classes of ncRNAs in the human transcriptome and assess their phylogeny in a way that is impossible using existing methods. To achieve this goal, we will develop novel experimental methods and integrative computational pipelines that will systematically identify novel classes of ncRNAs by combining both known and novel RNA-protein interactions and uncover clusters of multivalent interactions. We will identify conserved sequence and structural motifs, and evolutionary patterns specific to the novel classes, and develop computational systems to recognize members of the novel classes from these data.<br/><br/>This award was the result of an Ideas Lab that was co-sponsored by the four divisions in the NSF Directorate of Biological Sciences.

To realize this goal the institution will rely on its strong and trusted presence as a community leader among nearby local school districts that serve high-potential, low-income students. Over its 6-year duration, this project will fund scholarships to 12 unique full-time students who are pursuing bachelor?s degrees in Engineering or Engineering Technology. These first-year students will receive 4-year scholarships. This project aims to increase student retention and persistence in engineering by linking scholarships with mentoring and community-building activities to support students from different cultural backgrounds. The goal is to create learning communities that meet the needs of all populations and help diverse populations to thrive in engineering. Faculty mentors will be trained in the application of mentoring approaches that will support students coming from different cultural backgrounds. Further, the scholars will have a dedicated collaborative space on campus in which scholars can mingle, socialize, study, and hold seminars. This space will be located close to classrooms and faculty so that students can find community and social supports, build relationships with peers and faculty, and receive more structured mentoring and training. Because Grand Canyon University enrolls a highly diverse student population, this project has the potential to broaden participation in the engineering workforce and advance knowledge about the impact of mentoring approaches on student success in engineering for a diverse student population.<br/><br/>The overall goal of this project is to increase STEM degree completion of low-income, high-achieving undergraduates with demonstrated financial need. This project will assess the effectiveness of multicontextuality-centered mentoring, co-curricular experiences, and the collaborative space on student performance, retention, and learning outcomes. The multicontext intervention model used in this project can help address issues within academic cultures that affect student enrollment and completion to improve student success in engineering. This model has specific contextual components for both guiding and measuring change in academic units. Historically, this model has been applied successfully for underrepresented minority and female scholars but its applicability for socioeconomic diversity warrants further study. This project will investigate whether multicontextual approaches can support low-income students and which components are most effective in helping students succeed. A concurrent mixed-methods approach will be used to evaluate project outcomes including qualitative assessments of project meetings, focus groups, and surveys as well as quantitative data for activities such as collaborative space utilization, courses taken, and GPAs. Project results will be made available to university stakeholders via faculty and staff development seminars. The project team will disseminate project outcomes to the engineering education community through presentations at national conferences such as the American Society for Engineering Education and peer-reviewed journal publications. This project is funded by NSF?s Scholarships in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics program, which seeks to increase the number of low-income academically talented students with demonstrated financial need who earn degrees in STEM fields. It also aims to improve the education of future STEM workers, and to generate knowledge about academic success, retention, transfer, graduation, and academic/career pathways of low-income students.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The explicit development of these skills (also known as transferable, process, 21st century, or soft skills) is of critical importance to prepare students for successful careers in science and technology.  Skills such as critical thinking, problem solving, collaboration, and communication have been identified as essential for a modern national workforce by the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine as well reports from many industries and employers. These reports further identify that increased proficiency in student professional skills will ensure undergraduates a more successful launch as they begin their careers. In this project, a digital platform will be developed that leverages the Enhancing Learning by Improving Process Skills project, a novel and widely available feedback-based skills rubric. This project will provide strategies for instructors in classrooms of all sizes to help them develop and evaluate student professional skills. The digital platform and classroom strategies will also allow instructors to provide students with rapid feedback and effective coaching on how to improve their professional skills. This innovative project brings attention to the development of student professional skills as it will increase students? insights into the importance of these skills for scientists and advance their preparation for future STEM careers. <br/>     <br/>This project will help students develop and improve their professional skills in STEM classrooms by using a scalable digital platform based on novel feedback-based skill rubrics from the Enhancing Learning by Improving Process Skills project (ELIPSS.com). This project will conduct research on how feedback and self-assessment can help students improve their professional skills, as well as examine how external and tailored feedback can help students become self-regulated learners. The project team will design and pilot a digital platform to streamline assessment and actionable feedback delivery to students, using a multidisciplinary team of STEM instructors from a range of class sizes and institutional settings to ensure the application?s utility and adoptability. Through interviews and survey responses, instructional team members will identify optimum strategies for generating and delivering feedback to students that is both impactful and timely. Data will be collected on the ways in which students interact with the suggestions for improving skill development; these data will be analyzed to gauge how they responded to this feedback and whether it helped them improve their skills. Students will complete a validated science motivation questionnaire to collect their insights on how their development of professional skills may further motivate them towards STEM majors and careers. Five culminating goals and outcomes provide a framework for the execution of this project. First is the creation of a digital platform, which is preloaded with customizable professional skills rubrics that were a product of the NSF-funded ELIPSS project. Second, a team of instructors from a range of STEM disciplines and institutions across the country will implement and subsequently disseminate these materials. Third is the development of a set of materials and training protocols to train additional instructors to use the skill-building rubrics and digital platform. Fourth is the assembly of a collection of best instructional practices to optimize student interaction with feedback on their professional skill development. Fifth, and finally, is an advanced understanding of how these efforts impact students - promoting their skill development, their perception of the importance of these skill for scientists, and their preparation for future STEM careers. Overall, the broad scope of this project will enable greater integration of professional skill development into undergraduate STEM programs - the digital platform and classroom strategies are designed to be used in all disciplines, class sizes and institutional settings and will rapidly impact a large number of students. These students will enter the STEM workforce with key preparation in valued professional skills that will better ensure their success. Even more broadly, the tools and classroom strategies developed through this project will support the advancement of STEM education on multiple levels: they support active learning pedagogies, support skill-based programmatic assessment, and provide a data-collection mechanism for future education research. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through its Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Conference is to provide a forum for exploring current research and practices to enhance diversity and inclusion of all underrepresented populations in the engineering and computing professions including gender identity and expression, race and ethnicity, disability, veterans, LGBTQ+, 1st generation and socio-economic status. The CoNECD Conference is dedicated to all the diverse groups that comprise our engineering and computing workforce. The purpose of this project is twofold: 1) to enable the hosting of a panel of CAREER awardees at the CoNECD Conference and 2) to provide a preconference workshop to bring together Engineering Diversity Leaders (EDLs) from engineering academic units for a workshop to enhance both their DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) skillsets and enable the creation of a community of professionals. The Faculty Early CAREER Development Program (CAREER) is an NSF-wide program recognized as one of the most prestigious awards supporting early career faculty research efforts. It recognizes the importance of early academic career development and emphasizes the importance of the link between research and education. Research results in this area must be broadly shared with practitioners and other researchers to reap the full benefits of the research outcomes. EDLs are tasked with fostering inclusive environments and attending to retention and recruitment efforts at the undergraduate, graduate, and/or faculty levels. Additionally, they serve a community that includes pre-college, undergraduate, and graduate students and faculty and staff. However, being brought in as leaders and experts in their field, more is needed to know about the degree of support, professional development opportunities, and community these individuals have within their respective colleges and universities that pertain directly to their responsibilities. Bringing together researchers in this space and providing practical knowledge through information sharing in a workshop setting can be pivotal for practitioners in DEI leadership.<br/><br/><br/>This project will enable knowledge and community sharing of current practices in broadening participation through DEI leadership work with those charged with achieving this goal. It is expected that this will enable the practitioners to navigate political, resource-driven, and new environments that will increase the numbers of underrepresented and underserved individuals who engage in engineering and computing. Creating a community of DEI leaders in engineering/engineering technology academic units will facilitate sharing of ideas and best practices, as well as the development of mentoring relationships. The work conducted by EDLs is critical in achieving the stated goals and vision of equity, inclusion, and diversity at the college of engineering/technology level. Their work can be far-reaching in a college?s attempt to fulfill its strategic plans for DEI. For many colleges, these roles are new positions and relatedly have a limited body of research to reference for experiences, best practices, and community development. It is vital to cultivate and encourage a community of support for these individuals by connecting individuals with each other to share knowledge and history. This community of practice can share necessary tools, resources, and support to further their career goals and work successes. Additionally, we must bridge the research-to-practice divide. By bringing practitioners and researchers into the same space via the CoNECD conference, this project will enable greater communication between these groups and aid in disseminating research to those most suitable to implement interventions based on the research outcomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Since the dawn of neuroscience, researchers have sought to answer the question of how connected brain regions combine to produce decisions to complex problems. Previous work by the researchers of this project showed that the striosomal patches of the striatum are essential for integration of cost and benefit. In this project, the researchers test a multifaceted model of brain regions involved in complex decisions using advanced computational and experimental techniques. The model seeks to define the computational principles behind complex decisions involving cost and reward. To test this model, the researchers record and manipulate striosomal neuronal circuits in rats carrying out a novel, naturalistic cost-benefit decision-making task. The researchers apply novel machine learning concepts to aid identifying a mechanistic basis for the shift in circuit activity and decision-making between different decision-making contexts. In addition to pursuing the scientific objectives, the researchers develop and establish undergraduate and graduate courses that focus on the mechanisms of decision-making, and the analytical and experimental tools to study decision-making and neural circuit recordings. These courses aim to train future researchers to serve as critical thinkers that bridge experimental neuroscience and computation. <br/><br/>Every day, humans and other animals make hundreds of decisions regarding food preference, cost avoidance, reproduction, and social interaction. The investigators? recent research has provided the first clues that the striosomal compartments of the striatum are crucial gateways that affect the balance between the pursuit of reward and avoidance of costs during decision-making. Notably, striosomes selectively project to the lateral habenula (LH, predominant source of cost) and the dopaminergic neurons (DA) of the substantia nigra compacta (SNC, predominant source of reward). This Striosomal-DA-LH circuit is conserved across humans, monkeys, cats, rats, and even lampreys, and, therefore, understanding the role of this circuit in decision-making has broad implications. The investigators test the hypothesis that striosomes are a hub that affects interaction between the crucial players of the brain?s cost/reward evaluation system and, thus, influences subjective valuation of costs and rewards. To test this hypothesis, the investigators record and manipulate specific striosomal circuits in rats engaged in a novel, high-throughput decision-making task. Specifically, the investigators use high-throughput electrophysiology and Ca++ imaging to dissect the role of striosomal LH- and DA-projecting populations and an optogenetic approach to determine the causal role of each pathway in decision-making. Furthermore, using advanced computational modeling techniques, the investigators identify the computational principles that define how these circuits collectively mediate context-dependent decision-making states and influence choice behavior. The work is expected to reveal the role of striosomes in context-dependent perceptions of cost and benefit and their integration into one subjective value that affects decision-making.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The main obstacle to unleashing the full power of quantum computers is their extreme susceptibility to noise and decoherence. Despite the significant progress in designing fault-tolerant protocols over the last two decades, the fundamental limits of the permissible noise on quantum devices and the required overhead to correct the errors are not fully understood. This project aims to develop mathematical frameworks to design and analyze low-overhead fault-tolerant quantum computing schemes. In addition, the project also explores the minimum requirements for reliable quantum computation. The multidisciplinary nature of the research provides a unique educational environment for both graduate and undergraduate students who will be trained and mentored during this project.<br/><br/>The goal of this project is to develop mathematical models to describe error propagation in quantum circuits and use them to construct resource-efficient computing subroutines. The approach will enable the application of classical data compression and error correction codes in designing low-overhead reliable quantum computers. The developed framework will be used to understand the minimum resources required for reliable computation and to discover resource-efficient protocols by directly incorporating the hardware constraints of quantum processors. The systematic approach will provide an opportunity to perform computer-assisted search to find optimized constructions. The applications of the developed procedures to protect key fault-tolerant quantum operations such as code-switching will be investigated. The successful completion of this effort will make progress in lowering the hardware requirements to build reliable quantum processors capable of accurate large-scale quantum computation.<br/><br/>This project is jointly funded by the Foundations of Emerging Technologies core research program in the Computing and Communication Foundations Division and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR).<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project investigates the brain basis of behaviors that promote formation of social groups. Meadow voles provide an ideal opportunity to study mechanisms that support social grouping because they naturally transition between solitary and colonial in the wild, depending on the season. In summer, meadow voles maintain individual territories, while in winter they come together to form communal nesting groups. The goal of this research program is to understand how the nervous system changes to support this transition to sociality. By mimicking summer and winter day lengths in the laboratory, researchers can drive changes in meadow vole social behavior. These changes in behavior are accompanied by physiological changes in signaling pathways involved in stress, fear, and affiliation. This CAREER award focuses on how the pathways that change alongside social behavior are involved in shaping different aspects of social behavior including avoidance of unfamiliar individuals, social interest and tolerance, and preferences for specific companions. The proposed studies cross levels of analysis?connecting molecules, brain, and behavior to reveal neural mechanisms underlying the tendency to form social groups. These research activities are coupled to educational goals that will provide numerous training opportunities for undergraduate and graduate students, and will lead to the development of a new undergraduate research course to engage students in inquiry-driven learning. <br/><br/>For species that live in groups, peer social interactions are fundamental to group structure, and relationships regularly form between group members who are not reproductive partners. These relationships can be supported by prosocial factors such as motivation for social interaction, and/or by lack of antisocial tendencies such as avoidance, intolerance, and social fear. This project will test the hypothesis that winter sociality in meadow voles is facilitated by relaxation of antisocial factors including territoriality and fear, promoting social tolerance. Targeted pharmacological and viral manipulations will be used to investigate the functional role of seasonal changes in three pathways related to social fear and arousal. Specifically these include (1) the role of seasonal changes in oxytocin receptor signaling in mediating social selectivity and interaction with novel individuals; (2) how day length-mediated changes in corticotropin releasing factor signaling in specific brain regions influence social behavior; and (3) the role of seasonal changes in autonomic nervous system regulation. Understanding the neural causes and consequences of social grouping in meadow voles will yield fundamental insights into how non-reproductive relationships are mediated. The complementary educational plan focuses on undergraduate research training in the laboratory and classroom. These activities will make use of the data sets generated within this proposal and engage students in studying behavioral and physiological variation in meadow voles.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The water potential of soils and plants ? which can be imagined as the blood pressure of the natural world ? directly controls the flow of water through ecosystems and is a key regulator of the risk of plant mortality during droughts and heat waves. However, observations of water potential (commonly abbreviated with the Greek letter ?Psi?) are frequently scarce, inaccessible, and plagued by methodological challenges that hinder the synthetic research necessary to anticipate, and prepare for, climate change impacts in natural and managed ecosystems. PSInet ? a new network of data and people - will confront this information gap by: [1] promoting consistent collection and interpretation of water potential data by a global community of scientists through shared protocols, best practices, and early career training, [2] creating an open, global database for plant and soil water potential time series, and [3] supporting the synthesis of the PSInet database by a diverse community of scientists and practitioners to address previously intractable questions concerning plant responses to drought and heat stress. <br/><br/>Gradients in water potential are the energetic basis for the flux of water through plants, and water potential is a determinant of how much carbon plants remove from the atmosphere, how much water they use in the process, and the likelihood that plants survive droughts. However, while the study of plant water potential is theory rich, it is relatively data poor. Observations of water potential in soils and plants are relatively sparse, discontinuous, and unaggregated. Closing this information gap is fundamental for addressing unresolved theoretical controversies about plant response to drought and heat stress, and for making confident predictions about ecosystem function in a warming world. PSInet will rise to this challenge by building a global water potential database with multiple points of connection to related environmental observation networks, enabling cross-site synthesis necessary for inference at regional and global scales, and providing a much-needed platform for testing and refining modeling schemes. We will also craft community-driven protocols and best practices to support water potential measurement and interpretation, with a particular emphasis on emerging approaches for continuous water potential observations, which hold tremendous promise but are currently hampered by methodological difficulties. Finally, the project will create a PSInet ?Community of Practice? to encourage data submissions, elevate the end-use of the database, and broaden the intellectual, demographic, and geographic diversity of ecophysiological research. Together, PSInet will provide the data, collaborative platforms, and training necessary to confront previously intractable questions about plant responses to drought and heat stress.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To that end, this project will study a collection of problems under text compression and indexing with tremendous current relevance, owing to a specific characteristic prevalent in many modern text data sets, called high repetitiveness. This characteristic makes the data highly compressible using some specialized schemes. However, the theoretical understanding of those schemes is still in a nascent stage. This project will address some of the fundamental open problems on the effectiveness of several schemes that are popular in practice. This project will also introduce new ideas for indexing such data in a highly space-efficient manner and quickly support various (application-specific) queries. The techniques developed in this project will apply to a broad class of algorithmic problems and applications; therefore, they will have a lasting impact on related fields. The main results stem from this research will be disseminated through major conferences, journals, and workshop tutorials. The participation of undergraduates and minorities, including women, will be ensured.<br/> <br/>Suffix trees and suffix arrays are two fundamental data structures for text indexing with many applications in bioinformatics. However, they are notorious for their space complexity. The FM-index index encodes suffix arrays in space close to the entropy-based lower bound using the Burrows-Wheeler Transformation (BWT). But, the entropy model of compression is less effective in capturing repetitiveness. Therefore, modern applications urge even more space frugal encodings that exploit repetitiveness. Although the community has made some recent progress in exact pattern matching, solutions to many other (more complex) matching problems are still open. To that end, this project will attempt to design repetition-aware indexes for pattern matching under mismatches, edits, and wildcards, along with efficient construction algorithms. This project also aims to develop a unified framework to compress several advanced suffix-tree variants (quasi-suffix trees) that support even more complex matching paradigms such as parameterized and order-isomorphic matching. Novel techniques and concepts that go beyond the existing BWT-based methods will be sought. Additionally, the project will attempt a deeper study on various aspects of BWT-runs and the relative Lempel-Ziv compression scheme from the hardness side.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Teachers in the program will develop instructional materials that: 1) are standards-aligned; 2) engage students in research; and 3) advance the understanding of coastal ecosystems. This CE-BIORETS will influence the quality and delivery of learning experiences for teachers and students, foster engagement, and create competent 21st century STEM graduates. Project outcomes will be assessed through classroom implementation of curricula, public symposia for teacher/student presentations, and formative and summative evaluations by an external evaluator.  To ensure the advancement of DEI goals, candidates will be selected from schools with large, underrepresented populations.<br/><br/>This project is housed in the Institute of Environment and focused on the Coastal Ecosystems of South Florida. Research projects will examine ecological processes of the Everglades, mangroves, seagrass beds, and/or coral reefs with cross-cutting themes related to conservation, environmental forensics, and public health, among others. This CE-BIORETs program leverages NSF CREST, REU and LTER programs at FIU.  The program will include a field/lab research experience, presentation of results, curriculum development and implementation, ethics/responsible conduct of research training for mentors/participants, and an annual interview of mentor/participant experiences for program assessment.

To understand the cause and patterns of spread of a disease outbreak that began in late summer of 2022 at the Flower Garden Banks National Marine Sanctuary (northwest Gulf of Mexico, GoM), a team of ecologists, ocean connectivity and disease modelers, microbiologists, and coral immunologists (from Rice University, the University of Virgin Islands (UVI), Louisiana State University (LSU), and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution) is monitoring the health of corals, and biopsy their tissues. This data aid in developing a model that predicts coral disease transmission and its impacts on economically valuable coral reefs in the GoM. This project supports multidisciplinary field and laboratory research experiences of graduate students at multiple minority-serving institutions, and provides undergraduate students with hands-on training in modeling, ecological and molecular analysis techniques. UVI and LSU are in EPSCoR jurisdictions and have diverse student bodies, including numerous under-represented minority (URM) students. The research team collaboratively provides URM students with research experiences in STEM fields. Project findings are being broadly communicated through virtual public programming, to the Disease Advisory Council, and via direct updates to managers of the Flower Garden Bank National Marine Sanctuary. <br/><br/>Over the last four decades, diseases decimated ecosystem engineers in marine coastal environments, including coral reefs. Recent results from studies of white plague and stony coral tissue loss disease (SCTLD) show coral species immune traits can influence disease resistance and therefore predict of coral community structure post-outbreak in the Caribbean. In late August of 2022, an unidentified multi-species acute tissue loss disease with signs and species susceptibility characteristics reminiscent of white plague or SCTLD was documented at the Flower Garden Banks (northwest Gulf of Mexico, GoM). This disease is having significant impacts on FGB and could become widespread across the GoM, offering an opportunity to test hypotheses about the influence of coral community composition and pathogen dispersal on disease spread during the early stages of an outbreak; few studies examine this on relatively isolated, deep, coral-dense reefs. The interdisciplinary research team employs photomosaics and colony fate-tracking, layered molecular datasets and microscopy approaches, as well as modeling of disease reservoirs and dispersal to assess the etiology of the disease and contribute to the development of a generalizable framework for  disease spread on reefs. By parsing the impacts of reef-scale community composition versus seascape-scale dispersal in disease transmission and persistence, this work helps reveal the potential resistance and resilience of isolated, coral-dense reefs to diseases that decimate these ecosystems across the wider Caribbean.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dialects are rule-governed linguistic systems, yet linguistic features often differ across dialects. Dialects spoken by minority communities have been studied for its potential contribution to longstanding academic performance gaps between minority and majority students. One suggestion is that linguistic differences between a minority dialect and the dialect of instruction lead to a dialect mismatch that makes learning more difficult in the classroom. However, it remains unclear how speaking a minority dialect is related to academic performance because the work is primarily correlational. This study addresses that gap by investigating specific mechanisms using measures that are sensitive to sentence comprehension and language learning. Since the primary method of instruction in the classroom is through oral language, it is essential to understand how minority dialect-speaking children use the rules of their dialect to understand majority dialect sentences of the type more commonly found in schools. These results improve our understanding of how dialect mismatch impacts learning in real time while creating avenues for new strategies that can support spoken language comprehension and learning for children who speak different dialects and languages. <br/><br/>The current research uses two experiments to investigate how minority and majority dialect-speaking children use subject-verb agreement, which differs between the dialects, to process majority dialect sentences and make inferences to learn new words. A previous study completed by the research team demonstrates that minority dialect-speaking children use their grammatical knowledge of their minority dialect to comprehend majority dialect sentences that were ambiguous due to linguistic differences. However, the absence of real-time measures of comprehension raises additional questions about what cues children rely on for sentence interpretation and how it relates to learning. Experiment 1 tests the hypothesis that dialect mismatch impacts how minority dialect-speaking children use dialect features marked differently than a majority dialect to process sentences. The experiment uses an eye-tracking task to evaluate how minority dialect-speaking children use subject-verb agreement (e.g., was/were) to infer the subject number in ambiguous majority dialect sentences. Experiment 2 tests the hypothesis that children?s language knowledge will shape how they use subject-verb agreement to make inferences about new words. The experiment uses a verb learning paradigm containing morphological features (e.g., was/were, is/are) that differ between the majority and minority dialect to examine if there are differences in how majority and minority dialect-speaking children use the morphology as a cue to make inferences about a new word. Based on results from previous studies, minority dialect-speaking children should use their grammatical knowledge of the minority dialect to guide the inferences they make when processing majority dialect sentences. By studying minority dialect-speaking children, the researchers evaluate how children with diverse linguistic experiences process sentences and how linguistic variation shapes what cues children attend to when processing sentences in both a familiar and unfamiliar dialect.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polymer grafted nanoparticles represent a paradigm shift in how we fabricate, use, and recycle plastics because these composites have the potential to outperform traditional hybrids (i.e., physical mixtures of polymers and nanoparticles) in terms of strength and toughness. This is because the polymers are directly attached onto nanoparticles, thus ensuring that these materials constitute a chemically fixed mixture of polymers and nanoparticles ? physical mixtures, on the other hand, tend to demix. However, variability in the size of the nanoparticles and their grafts, which is known as dispersity, results in unusual rheological and fracture properties that remain poorly understood. The proposed research will employ molecular simulations, theory, and machine learning to help explain how dispersity causes these properties and how it could be further exploited for discovering materials that surpass the current capabilities of nanocomposites. These research ideas are closely coupled to educational and outreach objectives to enrich the K-12 and undergraduate pipeline for STEM students. For this purpose, the team will create online learning modules for simulations, polymer physics, machine learning, and materials design. Other activities include interdisciplinary training of graduate students through the Predictive Science and Engineering Design Cluster at Northwestern University, sharing of force field and software developments, software commercialization, and new research opportunities for underrepresented student groups.<br/><br/>The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems contribute funds to this award. The project addresses a critical knowledge gap in understanding how nanoscale interfacial chemistry, confinement and structural variations (grafting density, graft size and core size dispersities) in multi-component polymer-grafted nanoparticles (PGNs) govern dry layer extension and melt layer interdigitation, and consequently the emergent mesoscale ordering, dynamics, and failure mechanisms of PGNs. A barrier towards understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms is that existing computational paradigms, such as molecular simulations, either lack the fidelity or efficiency for predicting the structure, dynamics and hence properties of these systems. This issue will be addressed through a new scale-bridging method that will further coarse-grain PGNs to a nanoparticle level using chemistry-specific upscaling methods, and then use complementary data from finer models at two levels of hierarchy to inform Latent Variable Gaussian Process machine learning models. The adaptive machine learning model will enable rapid query of PGN properties in unexplored parametric spaces. The project encompasses three research thrusts: 1) Derivation of PGN pair potentials for multi-component systems; 2) Investigation of particle size and graft bidispersity effects on structure and rheology; 3) Development of an adaptive machine learning model for multi-objective design of PGNs. Ultimately, this novel framework will result in multicomponent PGNs that will break strength-toughness tradeoffs that hamper traditional nanocomposites. These research activities will also address open questions in materials informatics such as incorporation of categorical variables representing chemical groups in machine learning, finding optimal simulation batch sizes, and quantifying uncertainty due to noisy measurements. Discovering PGNs that exhibit mechanical property enhancements due to colloidal transitions is critical for them to become scalable, processible, and broadly useful as nanocomposites. To enrich the K-12 and undergraduate pipeline for STEM students, the team will create new activities including online learning modules for simulations, polymers, machine learning, and materials design.

Functional thin films, such as oxides, chalcogenides and nitrides, have a wide range of applications in semiconductor, communication, and energy industries. However, conventional methods for scalable manufacturing of functional thin films are time-consuming and wasteful, relying on solvents and trial-and-error approaches. The goal of this project is to apply machine learning to overcome challenges posed by structural and chemical defects associated with conventional thin film deposition, thereby improve film quality and manufacturing efficiency. Machine learning accelerates optimization of thin film growth conditions via training the experimental and computational data and speeds up the development of thin films with desired functionality. This award supports fundamental research to enable faster and cost-effective manufacturing of high-quality and large-area functional thin films for a broad range of applications in electronics, photonics, and energy conversion. Results from this project benefit the US economy and society by addressing semiconductor manufacturing and clean energy challenges facing the nation. This research involves multiple disciplines including materials science and engineering, machine learning, and advanced manufacturing. This interdisciplinary approach increases the participation of underrepresented groups in engineering research and education. <br/><br/>The limitations of conventional thin film deposition are lack of defect control and composition manipulation, long development time, and material waste. This project applies machine learning to ultrafast physical vapor deposition to overcome these limitations and manufacture high quality, large-area functional thin films. In physical vapor deposition, film thickness, microstructure, chemical composition, and property can be engineered by tailoring the processing parameters. Closely integrating machine learning, physical property calculations, and thin film growth conditions improves film quality, shortens development cycle and reduces material waste. This research uses machine learning algorithms, such as, linear and nonlinear regression and Bayesian optimization, to train film growth and property data generated by experiment and collected from literature. Machine learning models, in conjunction with in-situ monitoring, are used to optimize growth conditions such as substrate temperature, deposition time, partial pressure, and ramping and cooling rates and achieve the targeted electronic and optical properties at a lower cost and faster development cycle. The machine learning-assisted scalable manufacturing of functional chalcogenide thin films not only enriches the materials portfolio for solar energy conversion, but also advances their applications in electronics and photonics, such as photodetectors, phototransistors, thermoelectrics, and light emission diodes. This approach can also be applied to accelerate the development of other renewable energy materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Reliable and precise responses to such stimuli is often critical to take evasive actions and may be the difference between life and death in many situations. The project will use the nervous system of grasshoppers and locusts for these investigations as the neural processing underlying collision avoidance is particularly well understood in these animals. The project will gather data using a variety of experimental techniques and model the neural pathways responsible for the visual detection of approaching objects leading to collision avoidance under different simulated environmental conditions. A better understanding of the biological mechanisms leading to the robust detection of approaching objects may help design more robust and energy-efficient artificial collision avoidance systems such as small drones or portable devices for blind people.<br/><br/>Despite decades of work, the large-scale visual processing that results in visual object segmentation or identification remains poorly understood. In grasshoppers, the postulated mechanisms of object segmentation for collision avoidance and escape behavior rely on complex processing within the extended dendritic tree of a single neuron resembling in its morphology and synaptic organization that of a Purkinje cell in the cerebellum. Synaptic inputs impinging on this neuron are segregated into ON and OFF pathways with distinct anatomical properties allowing to investigate how they combine to encode textured stimuli mixing both contrast polarities. Several conductances involved in the processing of OFF inputs are ubiquitous in the dendrites of a wide range of neuron types. Thus, understanding how these conductances implement object segmentation will shed light on how they could implement similar neural computations across the nervous system. These dendritic conductances interact with Ca+2 and Ca+2-activated K+ conductances located close to the spike initiation zone that switch the neuron's firing mode between tonic and bursting. This project will shed light on how transitions between these two firing modes contribute to neural computation, as has been postulated in other sensory systems. The results are expected to shed light on how complex sensory information contributes to the generation of escape behaviors by integrating results at different levels of complexity, ranging from single conductances to whole organisms.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Engineered living materials consist of living cells and or organisms dispersed in a synthetic polymer matrix and have the potential to realize highly-desired properties found in biological systems.  To enable the full capacity of living materials as viable and robust engineering structures, mechanistic frameworks are needed to provide deep insights into how we can design and control the composition and architecture of these materials and structures for practical uses. This EArly-concept Grant for Exploratory Research (EAGER) project will establish a foundational understanding of the deformation and failure behavior of engineered living materials that focuses on algae-laden hydrogels. These hydrogels involve the photosynthetic activity of the algae which can be harnessed for oxygenation, carbon trapping, toxin sensing, and energy harvesting.  Advances in mechanics knowledge about these new engineered living materials could accelerate their use and adoption as ecofriendly alternatives and replacements of fossil-fuel-based polymers and plastics, which would be of significant environmental, ecological, and societal benefit. <br/><br/>The project will create a new multi-field continuum mechanics model amenable to computational implementation to describe the deformation and growth of engineered living materials.

The overarching goal of the project is to understand the role of extracellular RNA (exRNA) in communication between cells and in shaping the community of microbes, especially bacteria, that live on and inside plants, insects, and humans. These collections of microbes are often referred to as microbiomes and are critical for the health of plants and animals, including humans. A healthy microbiome promotes a healthy immune system, but how healthy microbiomes are maintained is poorly understood. This project will test the hypothesis that RNA secreted by host cells plays a central role in maintaining health both through communication among cells and by modifying the microbiome. RNA is best known for its key role in protein production inside cells, such as in RNA-based COVID vaccines. However, not all RNA encodes proteins, and cells produce more non-coding RNA than coding RNA, some of which is actively pushed into the environment by cells. This secreted RNA appears to be taken up by other cells, including bacteria and fungi, where it could potentially impact their growth. Understanding how exRNAs shape communication between cells and organisms will enable manipulation of exRNA communication in both agriculture and medicine, which will lead to development of environmentally friendly pesticides, as well as treatments that promote formation of healthy microbiomes in both plants and animals. This knowledge will also enable development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools for early detection and/or treatment of disease.<br/><br/>All cellular organisms secrete RNAs. The functions of these extracellular RNAs (exRNAs), however, are poorly understood. Two likely functions are intercellular and interkingdom communication. Open questions abound in exRNA biology: how are exRNAs selected for secretion, how are they targeted to recipient cells, and what are their roles in normal health and organismal fitness? Arabidopsis leaf exRNA isolates are highly enriched in the post-transcriptional modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) (as compared to total cellular RNA) suggesting that post-transcriptional modifications may tag specific RNAs for export. Consistent with this, human exosomal microRNAs are enriched with m6A (relative to cytosolic microRNAs). Interestingly, a large number of mammalian small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that localize to the external cell surface were recently found to harbor specific sialylated glycan modifications. These observations suggest that specific RNA modifications tag RNAs for cellular export and direct entry into appropriate recipient cells. This project will 1) test the hypothesis that exRNAs have specific features marking them for secretion and uptake, both within and among species, 2) determine how exRNAs are transferred from signaler to receiver cells, and 3) assess the impact of exRNA on microbiome health and composition through examining human gut, insect gut, and leaf surface models.<br/><br/>This project was co-funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Plant Genome Research Program and the Plant Biotic Interactions Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These applications require robots to work in complex, dynamic, and cluttered environments. Further, robots need to interact with other robots and humans. Understanding nuances in how robots interact with other robots allows for safer and more robust systems. State-of-the-art research often defines teams of robots as cooperative or non-cooperative, with fixed relationships and interactions within the team. However, this limits the capabilities of the robot team. This Faculty Early Career Development (CAREER) project envisions robot teams that adapt to others with emergent cooperation. Robots may change their cooperation based on their task, surroundings, and the decisions of others. Creating these robot teams requires new insight into how they make decisions. This project explores reputation, reciprocity, and co-existence for a robot team, which enable emergent cooperation. Equipping robots with these skills creates safer and more robust teams of mobile service robots.<br/><br/>This project investigates how to integrate underlying cooperation and interaction models into the design of a heterogeneous mobile robot team. Integral to this research are new types of geometric control policies that incorporate uncertainty and future predictions of other robots. Research on (1) reputation, (2) reciprocity, and (3) co-existence work towards the long-term goal of enabling emergent cooperation. Leveraging new geometric tools for environmental decompositions allows for fast and decentralized decision-making among robots, and combining this with game theory and nonlinear control allows the robots to reason about future actions. This project will develop new distributed and decentralized control algorithms with provable properties and demonstrate their performance in simulations and hardware experiments. The first objective focuses on predicting the reputation of other robots. Estimating reputation allows robots to partition an environment based on the predicted ability of others, adjusting to variations without direct communication. The second objective defines reciprocity, which allows robots to predict and negotiate local interactions based on historical interactions and improves the overall efficiency across teams. The third objective explores co-existence, which allows robots to predict conflict with other teams in shared environments and modify policies to reduce conflict while still fulfilling their goals. The performance of these policies will be analyzed through cooperative game theory and Lyapunov stability theory, allowing for provably quantifying the performance gains of robot teams. Ultimately, this enables a team of robots to cooperate with an unknown group of robots within a cluttered environment. Example applications include delivery robots and resource-foraging robots.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It focuses on studying and realizing quantum bits (qubits) in a new materials platform: superlattices of atomically thin transition metal dichalcogenides. In these materials, when one layer is rotated relative to another and then stacked on top of it, a superlattice is formed, which can act as a platform for realizing a 2-dimensional array of quantum dots or qubits that could be used in quantum communication or for quantum simulations. These quantum dots are amenable to optical readout, however, a challenge this grant addresses is that the dots are closely spaced, making it hard to address them individually. This project realizes a platform that combines the ability to control the superlattice through rotation of interlayer twist angle with a near-field scanning optical probe to address individual quantum dots, demonstrating a uniquely scalable approach to synthesizing large arrays of qubits. This project serves an important role of training a diverse quantum workforce through its support of PhD trainees, through providing internship opportunities for participants in local NSF traineeship programs, and through opening opportunities for undergraduate involvement.<br/><br/>To fulfill the promise of quantum-enabled computing and communications, it is imperative to manufacture high quality, on-demand single photon emitters that can be directly coupled to qubits. Beyond the coupling, these emitters should be amenable to efficient read-out to enable transfer of quantum information between disparate quantum nodes. Moir superlattices of 2D semiconductors, such as transition metal dichalcogenide, feature unique capabilities beneficial for addressing these challenges. In a moir superlattice, the periodic alignment and misalignment of crystal lattices produces an array of optically active quantum dots which host single emitters. These emitters exist in a planar crystal and do not rely on crystal defects, giving the advantage of scalability, electrical tunability, and optimized photon extraction efficiency. This project develops an approach to manufacture moir quantum dot arrays by dynamic control of the layer twist-angle and efficiently address individual dots via near-field optical read-out. A successful demonstration of this quantum manufacturing platform positions moir emitters as ideal systems for single photon emitters and optical quantum simulators.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It is anticipated that a total of 30 students, primarily from schools with limited research opportunities, or from an under-represented group, will be trained in the program. The SERC REU program focuses on how aspects of global change, including ecosystem conservation, climate change, and altered biodiversity, are changing ecosystem functions. During their internships, students will participate in field research, laboratory work, data analysis, and professional development, including sessions related to coding in R, scientific communication, and STEM careers. Interns will practice communicating with a variety of audiences, producing both a formal presentation for a scientific audience and a short video for lay audiences that describes the results and implications for their independent research projects. They also work with their mentors to find ways that their research informs, and is informed by, other disciplines to better understand the impacts of their work beyond the research sphere. Students will learn how research is conducted, and many will present the results of their work at scientific conferences. Assessment of the program will be done through the online SALG URSSA tool. Students will be required to register in the NSF ETAP system (etap.nsf.gov) and tracked after the program to determine their career paths.<br/><br/>In recent centuries, humans have dramatically altered the planet through habitat fragmentation, increased greenhouse gases, species introductions, excess nutrient loading, and native species extirpation. Determining and ultimately mitigating the consequences of these global transformations is a major goal in ecology and the primary focus of the REU program at the Smithsonian Environmental Research Center. The environmental issues of the 21st century are complex and require a multi-disciplinary approach. Our students are trained in many subfields including ecology, biogeochemistry, genetics, quantitative ecology, and science communication, resulting in rich experiences and scientific impacts. SERC researchers and interns collaborate with experts across the Smithsonian, as well as in communities and partner organizations, to conduct work that combines natural and social science research, community and stakeholder engagement, and education as part of the Smithsonian?s pan-institutional Working Land and Seascapes, Interconnected Health, and Urbanized Estuaries initiatives. This allows REU interns to expand their networks beyond SERC and engage a variety of voices and range of expertise that they can use to develop and implement their independent projects. In recent years, SERC REU intern projects have included studies on drivers of change in summer flounder populations in Chesapeake Bay, the impacts of rhizobia strain diversity on the productivity and herbivore resistance of soybean plants under different climate change scenarios, relationships among vegetation, salinity, and methane emissions from tidal saltmarshes, and estimations of carbon sequestration from seagrass beds in Belize using remote sensing. Since 2001, SERC?s REU interns have conducted novel research resulting in 77 presentations at national and international meetings and 44 peer-reviewed articles.

This garbage degrades the local environment, poses risks to human health, requires repeated volunteer clean up efforts, and may be a significant source of the plastics and microplastics found in lakes, oceans, and coastlines. Yet currently, we have a poor understanding of how garbage moves through and is stored within urban streams, and how it interacts with sediment, wood, and engineered structures along the way.  This project seeks to address two fundamental questions: (1) what controls where garbage is found in streams? and (2) what controls what garbage does to channel form and function?  With its wide variety of shapes and material properties, garbage is likely to behave in ways that are not predicted or explained by existing models of sediment transport. By measuring how garbage actually behaves in urban streams, this research will improve these models and advance science about the physical behavior of materials in streams and rivers. The results of this research will be useful for guiding litter management in cities and environmental clean-up and restoration efforts. The project will also provide educational opportunities for the public at community festivals and environmental events, as well as undergraduate and graduate students. <br/><br/>This project aims to quantify the geomorphic effects of garbage, or anthropogenic debris, in urban streams, by investigating the controls on its distribution and the changes that it produces. Geomorphic assessments, including quantification of anthropogenic macro-debris (>5 cm), conducted in an extensive, multi-city set of stream reaches will quantify its distribution within and across urban stream reaches and its interaction with other stream elements. Time lapse photography and repeat surveys of large debris, streambed topography, and sediment size will quantify debris mobility and geomorphic change as a function of geomorphology and hydrology. Flume experiments will identify the effects of debris properties and interactions among objects on the transport mechanics and geomorphic effects of anthropogenic debris. The field and laboratory work in this project will inform generalizable understanding of how material properties influence the geomorphic function of objects in fluvial systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Expectation maximization algorithms are derived to infer a probabilistic branching structure that can be used for contact tracing and source detection. Multivariate Hawkes processes are formulated to infer cross-transmission across separate geographic regions, where new theory and methods are needed to handle reproduction above the critical threshold of 1.  Point process analogs to compartmental models are developed through the project that can incorporate realistic transmission and under-reporting mechanisms (e.g. exposure period, asymptomatic cases) to improve forecasts and prevalence estimation. Finally, this project develops models of emerging epidemic events for determining the separability of disease parameters vs. space and time and assessing the risk that an outbreak will become a pandemic.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A healthy microbiome promotes a healthy immune system, but how healthy microbiomes are maintained is poorly understood.

Understanding how exRNAs shape communication between cells and organisms will enable manipulation of exRNA communication in both agriculture and medicine, which will lead to development of environmentally friendly pesticides, as well as treatments that promote formation of healthy microbiomes in both plants and animals.

Circadian disruption has significant implications for health, and a growing body of evidence indicates the existence of sex differences in the circadian systems of many species. Drosophila is a powerful model system to study the neuronal basis of sexual dimorphism in timekeeping due to its well-characterized circadian clock neuron network and the highly conserved molecular circadian clock. The main goal of this project is to understand how differences in the underlying architecture of the circadian system in the Drosophila brain underlie sex differences in sleep/wake cycles and robustness in timekeeping. Understanding the mechanistic basis of sexual dimorphism in the circadian system will inform our understanding of how males and females may be differentially affected by the challenges of complex modern environments. The education plan of the project consists of a summer research program for undergraduate students to conduct research involving connectomics, neurogenetics, and behavior that will allow students to gain research experience in the interface of biology, bioinformatics, and engineering. In addition, community outreach efforts will be conducted in partnership with the Columbia Zuckerman Institute?s public outreach programs office. They will involve participation in an event for families, Brain Clocks, in the context of the Saturday Science program, and a public event focused on conversations with New York City-based musicians in the context of the Breakout Science program, a series of interdisciplinary events that aims to create public engagement in science through the arts.<br/><br/>The circadian system provides internal temporal order for multiple aspects of physiology and behavior, allowing the anticipation of environmental changes. As in mammals, most of the work on Drosophila circadian rhythms has focused on males. The overarching hypothesis of this proposal is that sex differences in sleep/wake cycles are mediated by differences in the network properties of the brain?s timekeeping center. In Aim 1, the research team will test the hypothesis that the sexually dimorphic phenotypes of the Pigment Dispensing Factor (PDF) / PDF receptor (PDFR) pathway mutations are due to differential effects of PDF signaling in the clock neuron network. The team will use time-course immunohistochemistry to compare expression rhythms of clock proteins and CRISPR-Cas9 to knockout PDFRs in subsets of clock neurons. In addition, the team will determine if the PDFR-immunopositive neurons in females are less responsive to PDF-mediated Morning cell output using the ATP/P2X2 functional connectivity approach. In Aim 2, the team will test the hypothesis that the Morning oscillator has more influence over the male timekeeping neuronal network by changing the speed of the molecular clock in specific cell types and disrupting molecular oscillations in specific clock classes in males and females. In Aim 3, the team will characterize sex differences in structural and functional connectivity patterns between the Dorsal Neurons 1 posterior (DN1p?s) and the Morning oscillator. The team will compare the strength of the DN1p connections to Morning and Evening cells and test the hypothesis that glutamatergic inhibition of the lateral clock neurons by DN1p?s is more pronounced in males than females analyzing physiological responses to bath-applied glutamate. Collectively, the studies will advance our understanding of the mechanistic basis of differences in sleep/wake cycles between females and males.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While such a development model provides maximum modularity and flexibility, it raises unique challenges to traditional software-engineering principles. When web applications fail to behave as intended, developers often need to analyze code components written in various languages independently due to the lack of cross-language analysis support. Dynamically including source code from multiple parties makes it challenging to identify the root causes of errors because developers do not have access to third-party internals. Diverse languages and the use of third parties create technical boundaries that prevent web developers from obtaining a comprehensive understanding of the heterogeneous code on the client side. This project addresses the challenges of the technical boundaries existing in complex web applications and the creation of a scientific foundation for understanding, analyzing, and debugging web applications involving diverse languages and multiple parties. The project will support web-application reliability, increase web development productivity, and provide critical assurance for web users by shielding them from common web issues.  <br/><br/>The project plans to build a policy-specification language that enables web developers to compose specification policies to regulate many aspects of their code execution, such as enforcing control flow of critical events, securing web pages in the presence of unknown third-party services, and ensuring user experience. Based on these policies, novel program analyses and runtime techniques will be developed to expose possible violations (for problem identification) and automatic policy enforcement (for problem fixing), respectively. The policy specification and enforcement will provide assurance for web developers and enable them to control the code executed on their websites, which is lacking with current technologies. Approaches that support a cross-language analysis will be developed to handle interactions between diverse programming languages, including WebAssembly and JavaScript. Together, these activities will deepen the scientific understanding of the technical boundaries in complex web applications and create new program-analysis techniques to support more efficient web development.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The research involved in this project aims to expand our understanding about how electrons, the charge carriers, travel long distances in biological materials that are very poor conductors, as opposed to home or industrial electrical wires. It also focuses on a specific kind of enzymatic process where enzymes accelerate the chemical reactions involved in processes where biomolecules are oxidized or reduced, that is lose or gain electrons, a fundamental step in cell functionality. In this project, electron transport in biomolecules is studied through a synergistic theory-experimental effort which relies on advanced peptide synthesis and protein engineering and the measurement of currents at the single-molecule level. This research is relevant for our understanding of biological and cell function. Also, it advances our knowledge regarding fundamental aspects of electron transport in right-handed and left-handed molecules, which are pervasive in biological system.  The investigation can also be of importance in the areas of sensing and molecular quantum information. A postdoctoral fellow will be  receive cross-training by interactions with international collaborators. This project will create a link between academia and industry by delivering fundamental knowledge for sensor and diagnostic platforms. <br/><br/><br/>This project will study the role the electron spin-polarization generated in a chiral peptide matrix has on two remarkably efficient redox-based processes in biology; (1) the long-range electron transport and (2) the redox enzymatic reactions, both mediated by redox cofactors. These two aims will be achieved by first investigating the spin-polarization mechanisms of the electric current flowing through bespoke helical peptides, which constitute the main building blocks of the chiral matrix surrounding redox cofactors. Second, evaluating the impact of the above helix-induced spin-polarization in the electron transport efficiency of a model redox cytochrome. And third, evaluating its impact in the reaction rate of a redox enzymatic processes. The study will be carried out at the single peptide/protein level of resolution using a unique approach that combines advanced single-molecule conductance characterization with peptide synthesis and protein engineering. The single-peptide/protein method to measure molecular conductance is carried out in a precisely controlled nanoscale electrode-electrode gap of an electrochemical scanning tunnelling microscope, which allows operation in physiological conditions. This biophysical approach integrates an atomistic computational modelling of electron conductance of the entire single-molecule device, including both the molecules and the contacts. This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council where NSF funds the US investigator and BBSRC funds the UK partner.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These services are complex black boxes, running in a different administrative domain from the service owners. It is unclear if cloud services always run as expected when facing operator errors, misconfigurations, unexpected failures, hardware faults, and software bugs. This proposal aims to develop a new set of techniques to enable users to audit the integrity of their cloud services without trusting the cloud and without help from the cloud.<br/><br/>The proposed research has three main thrusts targeting three families of cloud services. The first thrust verifies transactional databases with a new framework that combines new polygraph data structures, graph encoding, Satisfiability Modulo Theories solving, and hardware accelerations. Besides auditing cloud databases, this thrust helps clarify client-centric guarantees provided by different isolation levels. The second thrust studies auditing the execution integrity of serverless computing, which enables users to ensure their serverless functions run as written. The third thrust aims to verify cloud deep learning compilation by proving the two models before and after compilation are semantically equivalent.<br/><br/>The proposed systems, by making auditing cloud services possible, enable individuals and organizations to gain confidence about the correctness of their outsourced services and further spur cloud providers to provide better services. In addition, the project will produce new lectures, talks, and outreach activities to highlight the risks of cloud failures and how auditing techniques work. The proposed project will develop a new graduate course about execution integrity. All the materials will be freely available to the public.<br/><br/>The project's code, data, documents, papers, technical reports, and course materials will be publicly available at the website: https://khoury-srg.github.io/AuditCloud.

While they are involved in chemical reactions, enzymes are not used up in the reactions. Studying these reactions at a fundamental level is particularly challenging, because it requires detecting individual enzymes. With support from the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program in the Division of Chemistry, Professor Jeffrey E. Dick at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill is advancing electrochemical methods for studying single enzymes. Working with his students, Professor Dick is creating tiny electrodes that can characterize chemical reactions catalyzed by a single enzyme in volumes smaller than a single cell. The project has the potential to offer new ways of studying chemical reactions in cells and impact the development of ultrasensitive biosensors. In addition, the activities provide training opportunities for graduate and undergraduate students who will become the next generation of electrochemists and biotechnologists. The group is also developing electrochemical instruments for use in high schools around the United States, broadening the impact of the project beyond the research laboratory.<br/><br/>With this award, the Chemical Measurement and Imaging Program is funding Dr. Jeffrey E. Dick at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill to develop electrochemical methods to detect and quantify single enzyme molecules. The amount of current a single enzyme produces depends on its maximum turnover rate. Common enzyme turnover rates are on the order of 1000 Hz, implying the amount of current generated by a single enzyme is under a femtoampere. This tiny current cannot be detected and quantified with reasonable bandwidth. With his students, Dr. Dick is developing potentiometric-based methods to address this fundamental limitation. Potentiometry is a powerful technique in that it requires a very small, variable bias current to produce a potential measurement, and the measurement itself is independent of electrode size. The amplification of a single enzyme?s turnover is achieved by trapping a single enzyme molecule within a sub-attoliter volume, synthesized as an emulsion or fabricated via nanofabrication. In these small volumes, effectively a single enzyme biosensor, a single enzyme?s physicochemical properties are rigorously evaluated using novel electrochemistry-based measurement methods developed in this research project. The project also focuses on methods that hold promise to specifically and rapidly detect single virus particles such as COVID-19.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of the project is to understand the role of extracellular RNA (exRNA) in communication between cells and in shaping the community of microbes, especially bacteria, that live on and inside plants, insects, and humans. These collections of microbes are often referred to as microbiomes and are critical for the health of plants and animals, including humans. A healthy microbiome promotes a healthy immune system, but how healthy microbiomes are maintained is poorly understood. This project will test the hypothesis that RNA secreted by host cells plays a central role in maintaining health both through communication among cells and by modifying the microbiome. RNA is best known for its key role in protein production inside cells, such as in RNA-based COVID vaccines. However, not all RNA encodes proteins, and cells produce more non-coding RNA than coding RNA, some of which is actively pushed into the environment by cells. This secreted RNA appears to be taken up by other cells, including bacteria and fungi, where it could potentially impact their growth. Understanding how exRNAs shape communication between cells and organisms will enable manipulation of exRNA communication in both agriculture and medicine, which will lead to development of environmentally friendly pesticides, as well as treatments that promote formation of healthy microbiomes in both plants and animals. This knowledge will also enable development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools for early detection and/or treatment of disease.<br/><br/>All cellular organisms secrete RNAs. The functions of these extracellular RNAs (exRNAs), however, are poorly understood. Two likely functions are intercellular and interkingdom communication. Open questions abound in exRNA biology: how are exRNAs selected for secretion, how are they targeted to recipient cells, and what are their roles in normal health and organismal fitness? Arabidopsis leaf exRNA isolates are highly enriched in the post-transcriptional modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) (as compared to total cellular RNA) suggesting that post-transcriptional modifications may tag specific RNAs for export. Consistent with this, human exosomal microRNAs are enriched with m6A (relative to cytosolic microRNAs). Interestingly, a large number of mammalian small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that localize to the external cell surface were recently found to harbor specific sialylated glycan modifications. These observations suggest that specific RNA modifications tag RNAs for cellular export and direct entry into appropriate recipient cells. This project will 1) test the hypothesis that exRNAs have specific features marking them for secretion and uptake, both within and among species, 2) determine how exRNAs are transferred from signaler to receiver cells, and 3) assess the impact of exRNA on microbiome health and composition through examining human gut, insect gut, and leaf surface models.<br/><br/>This project was co-funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Plant Genome Research Program and the Plant Biotic Interactions Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, developing and implementing strategy typically requires many members of both upper and middle management to communicate and shape strategy through formal (top-down) and/or informal (lateral, upward) processes of influence. Unfortunately, the patterns of communication and informal influence that often arise among upper- and middle-level management groups can pose problems for strategic effectiveness. Such leadership failures are common, costly, and cannot be addressed without a better understanding of who will lead and who will follow in the upper layers of organizations. Although prior research has examined the characteristics of top executives to understand firm effectiveness, scholars agree that how top managers and middle-level managers need to interact to propel their firms toward greater success remains a ""black box"". This project delves into this black box by advancing and testing new theory related to the multilevel causes and consequences of the networked patterns of leadership and communication processes that emerge in the upper levels of organizations. By studying the complex dynamics inherent in the leadership of large organizations, this project directly and positively impacts each participating organization as well as the aggregate economy that relies on these organizations. <br/><br/>This project leverages partnerships with the Center for Creative Leadership (CCL) and the Gutierrez Energy Management Institute (GEMI) in order to conduct survey- and interview-based research with upper- and middle-level managers from approximately 50-75 organizations from a variety of industries (Study 1) and approximately 25 organizations within the Energy Industry -- an industry that is vital to national interests (Study 2). As a recruitment incentive, our research team is providing tailored feedback for each participating organization in the form of an hour-long virtual debrief presentation and personalized report delivered to senior executives. To maximize internal validity, field study results are being combined with a large-scale controlled laboratory experiment manipulating the drivers of leadership and communication networks in hierarchical multi-group systems (Study 3). Therefore, this research program connects micro-, meso-, and macro-level organizational theories and corresponding research methods in order to address critical and unanswered questions related to the drivers and outcomes of informal leadership and communication networks in the upper levels of organizations.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, water management, research, and engineering still largely operate within local homegrown paradigms. Water managers and researchers are typically familiar with their own methods, sites, and toolkits. However, local focus has consequences, and opportunities are lost when we do not learn from successes and failures in other regions. Sharp and Leshner (2014) argue that ""the search for solutions needs to draw upon the talents and innovative ideas of scientists, engineers, and societal leaders worldwide to overcome traditional and nationalistic paradigms that have so far been inadequate to meeting these challenges."" The goal of this project is to contribute to US expertise in solving future water-related challenges. UC Davis and IHE Delft will join forces to bring three cohorts of US advanced graduate students to Europe and provide them immersive experiences in critical analysis of differing international approaches to water science, policy, and management. Year 1: international approaches to flood-risk management, year 2: drought and groundwater management, and year 3: freshwater ecosystems in a climate of growing extremes. STEM workforce development outcomes will include students trained in: collaborating across international boundaries on international problems and in international settings, integrating across multiple disciplines and across international paradigms, to integrate water science into management and policy-making, team-based problem solving, and trained to promoted an inclusive and supportive environment that advances diversity and inclusion as core values. Overall, this project will contribute to US expertise in solving future water-related challenges domestically and worldwide.<br/><br/>The project has three themes. <br/>1. International approaches to flood-risk management: Flood magnitudes, frequencies, and impacts are becoming more severe in most areas as a warming climate increases atmospheric precipitation and storm intensity. The field of flood risk management integrates flood risk assessment and its reduction to a tolerable level using diverse technical and social measures, leading to increased resilience and adaptation capacity. Integrated flood risk management aims to reduce the human and socioeconomic losses caused by flooding while at the same time taking into account the benefits from floods and the use of flood plains or coastal zones.<br/>2. International approaches to drought and groundwater management: Groundwater resources have long been used for domestic, irrigation, and industrial water supplies where access to surface water is lacking, either seasonally, long-term, or due to unusual climate events leading to relative lack of precipitation and runoff (drought). Dwindling groundwater resources not only threaten long-term sustainability of agricultural production and domestic water supplies, they also cause expensive and sometimes unaffordable increases in pumping costs, well outages, land subsidence, seawater intrusion, and water quality degradation, among others. Climate change leads to changing patterns and intensity of drought, of groundwater recharge, and of water demands on groundwater reservoirs. <br/>3. Freshwater ecosystems in a climate of growing extremes: Watersheds and river environments are complex ecological systems where geologic structures interact with hydrologic processes to support ecological functions and associated aquatic and riparian habitats. As the chief source of renewable water supply for freshwater ecosystems and societal use, rivers and wetlands provide vital supporting, provisioning, regulating, and cultural ecosystem services. Riparian zones account for more than 75% of terrestrial animals in the western U.S. The global extent and severity of ecosystem decline has stimulated a worldwide response in the formation of the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) and launch of the UN Decade on Restoration (2021-2030). Like ecosystems themselves, addressing the threats requires scientists capable of working across disciplines, technologies, and landscapes. To understand the complex ecology of freshwater systems, students must understand their interdisciplinary and integrative nature, ultimately learning to think synergistically about biological, physical, chemical, and anthropogenic interactions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ethnic and linguistic identity are central to human social organization and enable people to identify with other group members without personally knowing each of them. This ""ethnolinguistic identity"" encourages cooperation at a scale that allows humans to solve problems that could not be tackled with a smaller number of people but may also discourage cooperation between groups. Because cooperation is an ongoing source of human ingenuity and conflict today, it is essential to understand the conditions under which it first emerged and was maintained by our forager ancestors. Did populations become separate because they followed different patterns of resource use across the landscape? Was interaction then discouraged because of the development of cultural barriers? To what extent did ancient human groups share information and/or resources while maintaining biological and cultural boundaries? Archaeologists can now combine advances in ancient DNA, computational simulations, and ancient environmental reconstruction with analysis of cultural remains to understand the formation and consequences of ethnolinguistic identities in early human populations. This study enhances career opportunities and provide training for a postdoctoral researcher, graduate students, and undergraduates. By embedding the work in local communities, scientific training will occur within a multicultural research environment that builds essential skills needed for maximizing the benefits of a diverse STEM workforce.<br/> <br/>The research team will conduct research in two regions, where ancient DNA analysis has revealed that forager populations began to maintain separate biological groupings near the end of the last Ice Age cycle. The investigators will develop well-dated cultural and environmental records from sites around and including where ancient DNA has been discovered. The team will conduct new, high-resolution excavations and analyze the remains they recover alongside existing materials excavated using lower resolution methods in the 1970s. This increased detail will enable both datasets to be brought into alignment and maximize their information value to show if cultural remains such as stone artifacts, pigments, bone tools, and beads show evidence of emerging cultural differences between groups known from ancient DNA to have had little biological interaction. Using environmental data, the team will build simulation models of forager resource use to understand how often people would have encountered one another.

This process creates new genetic variation in the progeny, which facilitates adaptation to new environments and purges detrimental mutations from genomes. Meiotic recombination is one of the main mechanisms of evolution and is also an unparalleled instrument of plant and animal breeding. However, despite their importance, recombination events are not evenly distributed throughout the genome. Instead, they predominantly take place at distinct sites called recombination hotspots. Compared to other groups of eukaryotes, little is understood about the mechanisms controlling recombination in plants, and particularly little is known about recombination in crops, which tend to have large and complex genomes. The goal of this project is to determine how specific sites in the genome become recombination hotspots in maize, a model species as well as a major crop, how recombination hotspots evolve, and how they can be modified to improve plant breeding methods. A large fraction of maize genes are located in regions that show very limited recombination. Developing ways to increase recombination in these regions will allow more efficient breeding. To further spread the knowledge about meiotic recombination, the laboratories participating in this project will jointly operate a Science Undergraduate Minority Mentoring Internship and Training (SUMMIT) program, which each year will sponsor three 10-week internships for minority undergraduate students. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to elucidate the meiotic recombination landscape in maize and gain the ability to modify it. Meiotic recombination starts with a programmed formation of double-strand breaks (DSBs) in chromosomal DNA. Repair of the DSBs leads to reciprocal exchanges of chromosome arms called crossovers (COs). In most species, including maize, large numbers of meiotic DSBs are generated but very few of them become COs. Furthermore, although DSBs are ubiquitously present throughout the entire maize genome, most COs are near chromosome ends. This project will examine how chromatin as well as DNA sequence affect CO landscape and how the knowledge of recombination mechanisms can be used to alter CO landscape. To understand the role of chromatin and chromosome characteristics in shaping CO distribution, the impact of chromatin state, and the dynamics of homologous chromosome interactions on the progression of CO formation will be investigated. The relationship between genome sequence and CO patterns will also be studied to understand how genetic diversity affects CO landscapes. To test the knowledge on recombination genomics gained from this project, and to apply it for a practical purpose, effectiveness of artificial CO hotspots will be examined. This research will provide a more complete picture of how recombination is controlled in plants and facilitate development of efficient tools to harness it for plant breeding. <br/><br/>This award was co-funded by the Plant Genome Research Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems and the Genetic Mechanisms Cluster in the Division of Molecular and Cellular Biosciences.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In some cases, sentence structures and meanings align with our expectations and sentences are easier to process: people can understand them more easily and are more likely to interpret them correctly. However, sometimes our expectations conflict with the actual interpretation of the sentence and make the sentence more difficult to process. This research investigates how the brain generates these expectations and how they are used in understanding sentences. The project studies this in an understudied language in experimental research, monitoring people?s eye movement as they read sentences, with a diverse set of native speakers in the U.S. and abroad. This research improves our understanding of the various factors that interact to affect how humans process language, which helps inform developments in areas such as technology and medicine. <br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation project specifically answers the question, how do language comprehenders make use of statistical expectations about sentence structure in light of conflicting input (e.g., input using less common sentence structures)? The project investigates this question by further testing existing theories of language processing, such as memory- and expectation-based theories of processing difficulty, alongside other theories of language comprehension, in particular good-enough and noisy-channel processing theories. The project tests these theories by recording eye movements during reading, and identifying how these eye movements change while reading a difficult sentence as compared to an easy sentence. The researchers additionally test the readers? understanding of each sentence with comprehension questions, evaluate how a reader?s expectations about the structure and the meaning of a sentence affect their final interpretation of the sentence, and evaluate findings through Bayesian mixed effects regression models.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Fire-safe and low-cost redox flow batteries, combined with rooftop solar panels or backyard wind turbines, can meet the increased electricity needs of American families without relying on the national grid. During the daytime, solar arrays convert solar energy to chemical energy in batteries. During evenings, batteries will power houses and charge electric vehicles in family garages. Batteries play a critical role in harvesting and storing clean electricity for residential uses. Compared with lithium-ion batteries, the improved fire-safety profiles and reduced production costs of flow batteries will give homeowners peace of mind and allow the wider adoption of clean energy by society.<br/><br/>This SBIR phase I project proposes to develop novel proton-conductive polymeric membranes that show reduced metal electrolyte crossovers and build the first 7 kW flow battery system that meets the energy need of a single-family house. To this end, the project will synthesize a group of phosphorylated polybenzimidazoles (PBIs) that have a phosphoric acid side chain. Such phosphoric acid groups can form unique zirconium phosphonate clusters that transport protons but deny the unwanted migration of metal cations. PBIs provide mechanical support to the zirconium-phosphate clusters. Zirconium and PBIs are bulk materials that cost significantly less than commercial perfluorosulfonic acids. The second task of this phase I project is to construct a 7 kW iron-titanium redox flow battery system. The peak electricity demand for the average American single-family house is around 7 kW. Such a battery will be connected to a rooftop solar system to meet residential electricity demands. The team plans to study various cell configuration designs. In particular, the project will focus on examining the effects of solvent channels of bipolar plates on the performance of the stack. In addition, other design parameters, such as pump flow rates and the choice of sealant materials, will be thoroughly investigated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studying these relationships can be difficult as it is often impossible to separate the microbes from their host. As a result, understanding of the mechanisms that underly these relationships has been limited by the inability to manipulate both host and symbiont independently. Kissing bugs are insects that feed exclusively on vertebrate blood and serve as host to symbiotic bacteria, that help them successfully develop and reproduce. These bacteria also can be cleared from the kissing bugs and infected with new bacteria. The symbiont bacteria can also be grown outside of the insect and can be genetically altered. This system, thus, provides a unique opportunity to experimentally manipulate the host and symbiont, to identify and characterize factors that support the symbiosis. The research will focus on genes involved in symbiont colonization of the host, host and symbiont genes involved in the exchange of nutrients, and interactions of the host immune system and the symbiont. Given the ubiquity of animal-microbe symbioses, this research will illuminate mechanisms that may govern host-microbe interactions in other less-tractable systems. Along with the proposed research, this project will also provide research experience and training to high school teachers. This experience will be paired with curriculum development to incorporate host-microbe interactions into the teachers? classrooms. <br/><br/>Experimental manipulation of host-microbe systems has been limited by inability to separate highly integrated partners or difficulties disentangling the effects of individual members in highly complex communities. Triatomine kissing bugs harbor essential symbionts in their gut which are environmentally acquired each generation, allowing for generation of bacteria-free, axenic insects, which can then be experimentally inoculated with bacteria. This work leverages the unique features of this system ? ability to generate axenic and gnotobiotic insects, low-complexity microbiomes, and molecular tools ? to delineate the mechanistic basis of symbiosis. Transposon mutagenesis will be used to identify genes in the symbiont Rhodococcus rhodnii that are essential for symbiosis followed by generation of knockout strains of R. rhodnii lacking symbiosis-promoting genes. Knockout strains will be used for bioassays to characterize the role of the gene-of-interest in the relationship. The role of the host immune system in regulating bacterial abundance will be assessed, examining both humoral and cellular immune responses to symbionts. Lipid metabolism genes including fatty acid synthases and fatty acid CoA reductases have been identified as differentially expressed in axenic and gnotobiotic insects. Liquid chromatography and mass spectroscopy will be applied to understand how symbiotic bacteria shape the lipidome of kissing bugs while silencing of specific lipid genes will reveal the role of these genes in lipid metabolism and host fitness. The proposed work will shed new light on the evolution of host-symbiont interactions and serve as a framework for exploring systems which are less amenable to experimental manipulation.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Although traditional plant breeding and fertilizer application have produced large increases in agricultural yields in the past, yields have plateaued in recent years. This project uses novel genome-scale technology and advanced analysis methods to identity and characterize the tens of thousands of genetic elements that drive growth and environmental resilience in maize and tomato, crops that represent two major classes of plants. The large size of the resulting data sets enables systematic computational analyses of these elements and allows for design of synthetic elements with desirable features. The applicability and safety of these designs for future crop engineering will be examined in maize and tomato plants in the laboratory. Today?s plant researchers and breeders need to be fluent in conducting genome-scale experiments and applying advanced computational methods. This project will provide funds for the training and the career development of several undergraduate students and postdoctoral fellows.<br/><br/>The limited understanding of plant gene regulation and lack of diverse, plant-derived regulatory elements to drive transgenes have hampered plant synthetic biology. To facilitate plant synthetic biology, this project will apply massively parallel reporter assays and machine learning to decipher the grammar of gene-regulatory elements in maize and tomato, including enhancers, promoters, insulators and terminators, and their local interactions in response to four common environmental conditions. The salient features of these regulatory elements and element combinations will be identified by convolutional neural network models, which will be used to evolve and design synthetic elements with desired features. Designed promoter and enhancer elements, along with plant-derived insulators and terminators, will serve as building blocks for synthetic biology applications.

In the U.S., approximately 22% of the population speaks both English and another language. Consequently, ?foreign-accented? varieties of English are common. Foreign-accented varieties differ from ?native-accented"" varieties in several ways. This doctoral dissertation focuses on how speech sounds are pronounced by different speakers who speak English as a first or second language. Previous research has shown that listeners are able to adapt to the speech sounds of foreign-accented speech within a minute of exposure. However, how listeners acheive this rapid adaptation is still unknown. Understanding how listeners achieve this level of flexibility in speech perception is critical for informing not only linguistic theories of speech perception but also technological advances in automated speech recognition systems like the popular voice assistants Alexa and Siri. The present dissertation investigates the interface between second language speech production and first language speech perception in a series of behavioral and electrophysiological experiments.<br/><br/>The doctoral dissertation research is guided by three research questions: (1) How does experience with Spanish-accented English facilitate later comprehension of Spanish-accented English speech? (2) How specific does this experience need to be? (3) What can time-sensitive neurocognitive measures of language processing such as electroencephalography--the measure of electrical activity at the scalp--illuminate about second language-accented speech perception? The ideal adapter framework provides a strong theoretical foundation from which to investigate the interface between second language (L2) speech production and first language (L1) speech perception. Under this framework, listeners are sensitive to the probability distributions between acoustic cues and phonetic categories. Listeners can learn the specific cue-category mappings that characterize a particular group of talkers in order to achieve robust perception. The present dissertation uses the cue-category mapping between voice onset time (VOT) and the voiceless stop consonants /p/, /t/, and /k/ as a test case for this hypothesis. Perceptual ambiguity between these voiceless stops and their voiced counterparts /b/, /d/, and /g/, respectively, due to cross-language transfer in Spanish-accented English provides a window into the adaptation process. The present dissertation uses cross-modal priming to measure adaptation to Spanish-accented /p t k/ both behaviorally and neurocognitively with electroencephalography (EEG/ERP). The researchers implement an innovative experimental design to compare the factors of (A) exposure to variability across multiple talkers with the same accent and (B) the level of similarity between the accented features encountered during the exposure phase and those encountered during the test phase. To date, these factors have not been compared directly, limiting our understanding of adaptation to L2-accented speech. In addition, the researchers use a single group of talkers across exposure conditions to control the type and amount of experience with each individual talker. Finally, this study is the first to investigate perceptual adaptation to L2-accented speech with EEG. Using this fine-grained, time-sensitive measure reveals the relative contributions of phonetic, phonological, and semantic information in resolving perceptual ambiguity in L2-accented speech.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Their perception of a conversation partner?s language knowledge, for example, can influence their expectations for what language(s) are needed or appropriate in an interaction.  Theories of bilingual language control, which consider how bilinguals engage and switch between their languages, postulate a role for social information in these processes but have not determined what aspects are relevant.  Furthermore, where studies have considered the role of social context on bilinguals? language control mechanisms, they have traditionally utilized measures that are not locally situated and, therefore, do not capture the ways in which localized social meanings may impact bilingual language processing and control. To better reflect how bilinguals communicate, however, theories of bilingual language control must account for the social meanings that bilinguals associate with the use of their languages within a local context. <br/><br/>Through semi-structured interviews, social evaluation tasks, and perception tasks with Mexican American, Spanish-English bilinguals, this doctoral dissertation project will investigate how local social meanings shape bilinguals? expectations of what language(s) someone will speak and, consequently, their perception of that person?s speech.   This work contributes to the understanding of how detailed, community-grounded social information is engaged in bilingual language perception and control processes, expanding our knowledge of what aspects of social context matter for bilinguals when perceiving and producing language.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Functional thin films, such as oxides, chalcogenides and nitrides, have a wide range of applications in semiconductor, communication, and energy industries. However, conventional methods for scalable manufacturing of functional thin films are time-consuming and wasteful, relying on solvents and trial-and-error approaches. The goal of this project is to apply machine learning to overcome challenges posed by structural and chemical defects associated with conventional thin film deposition, thereby improve film quality and manufacturing efficiency. Machine learning accelerates optimization of thin film growth conditions via training the experimental and computational data and speeds up the development of thin films with desired functionality. This award supports fundamental research to enable faster and cost-effective manufacturing of high-quality and large-area functional thin films for a broad range of applications in electronics, photonics, and energy conversion. Results from this project benefit the US economy and society by addressing semiconductor manufacturing and clean energy challenges facing the nation. This research involves multiple disciplines including materials science and engineering, machine learning, and advanced manufacturing. This interdisciplinary approach increases the participation of underrepresented groups in engineering research and education. <br/><br/>The limitations of conventional thin film deposition are lack of defect control and composition manipulation, long development time, and material waste. This project applies machine learning to ultrafast physical vapor deposition to overcome these limitations and manufacture high quality, large-area functional thin films. In physical vapor deposition, film thickness, microstructure, chemical composition, and property can be engineered by tailoring the processing parameters. Closely integrating machine learning, physical property calculations, and thin film growth conditions improves film quality, shortens development cycle and reduces material waste. This research uses machine learning algorithms, such as, linear and nonlinear regression and Bayesian optimization, to train film growth and property data generated by experiment and collected from literature. Machine learning models, in conjunction with in-situ monitoring, are used to optimize growth conditions such as substrate temperature, deposition time, partial pressure, and ramping and cooling rates and achieve the targeted electronic and optical properties at a lower cost and faster development cycle. The machine learning-assisted scalable manufacturing of functional chalcogenide thin films not only enriches the materials portfolio for solar energy conversion, but also advances their applications in electronics and photonics, such as photodetectors, phototransistors, thermoelectrics, and light emission diodes. This approach can also be applied to accelerate the development of other renewable energy materials.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The LC-NE system projects broadly throughout the CNS and has been shown to regulate cognition and sensory signal processing across all stages of wakefulness. Although it prominently innervates motor centers of the brain, a similar role for the system in regulating posture, balance, reflex and goal-directed movement across the waking state is largely unexplored. With development of new methodology for visualization of LC neurons that send projections to CNS motor circuits, the anatomy and physiology of LC-NE inputs to motor centers will be determined. These experiments will provide information that will advance our thinking about how the LC-NE system exerts influences on not only motor activity but also sensory signal processing and executive function in the context of adaptive behaviors. More broadly there are brain-wide applications for this approach relative to a host of transmitter-specific pathways in the CNS and the project itself can be used as a training platform for a next generation of neuroscientists. The project will also facilitate training of high school students in research through the High School Biomedical Science Scholar program as well as of undergraduates from under-represented groups through the Rutgers-Camden MARC program.<br/><br/>More specifically, the current project focuses on the innervation of CNS motor circuits by the brainstem nucleus locus coeruleus (LC) and its impact on motor network function. For more than 50 years LC was considered homogeneous in structure and function such that its primary transmitter norepinephrine (NE) could be released uniformly and act simultaneously on cells and circuits throughout the brain and spinal cord. However, recent studies from our laboratory and elsewhere have provided compelling evidence that LC is modular in design, with segregated output channels to sensory, motor, and cognitive circuitries throughout the CNS and the potential for differential release of NE in these functionally diverse projection fields. These findings have prompted a radical shift in thinking about LC operations and demand revision of theoretical constructs regarding the impact of the LC-NE system on behavioral outcomes involving not only sensory and cognitive domains but also movement generation. Within this context, a major gap in our knowledge is the anatomical and physiological relationship between the LC-NE system and CNS motor control centers. The investigators' approach using an intersectional genetic mouse model, retrograde viral vector tracing, and ex vivo electrophysiology will allow them to determine if LC-motor circuit projection cells express unique electrophysiological properties and maintain an organized network of dendritic arbors and axon collaterals that is specific to motor terminal fields and capable of supporting selective, synchronous release of NE in CNS motor centers for the purpose of coordinately regulating operations responsible for balance, postural adjustments, and execution of voluntary movements.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of the project is to understand the role of extracellular RNA (exRNA) in communication between cells and in shaping the community of microbes, especially bacteria, that live on and inside plants, insects, and humans. These collections of microbes are often referred to as microbiomes and are critical for the health of plants and animals, including humans. A healthy microbiome promotes a healthy immune system, but how healthy microbiomes are maintained is poorly understood. This project will test the hypothesis that RNA secreted by host cells plays a central role in maintaining health both through communication among cells and by modifying the microbiome. RNA is best known for its key role in protein production inside cells, such as in RNA-based COVID vaccines. However, not all RNA encodes proteins, and cells produce more non-coding RNA than coding RNA, some of which is actively pushed into the environment by cells. This secreted RNA appears to be taken up by other cells, including bacteria and fungi, where it could potentially impact their growth. Understanding how exRNAs shape communication between cells and organisms will enable manipulation of exRNA communication in both agriculture and medicine, which will lead to development of environmentally friendly pesticides, as well as treatments that promote formation of healthy microbiomes in both plants and animals. This knowledge will also enable development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools for early detection and/or treatment of disease.<br/><br/>All cellular organisms secrete RNAs. The functions of these extracellular RNAs (exRNAs), however, are poorly understood. Two likely functions are intercellular and interkingdom communication. Open questions abound in exRNA biology: how are exRNAs selected for secretion, how are they targeted to recipient cells, and what are their roles in normal health and organismal fitness? Arabidopsis leaf exRNA isolates are highly enriched in the post-transcriptional modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) (as compared to total cellular RNA) suggesting that post-transcriptional modifications may tag specific RNAs for export. Consistent with this, human exosomal microRNAs are enriched with m6A (relative to cytosolic microRNAs). Interestingly, a large number of mammalian small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that localize to the external cell surface were recently found to harbor specific sialylated glycan modifications. These observations suggest that specific RNA modifications tag RNAs for cellular export and direct entry into appropriate recipient cells. This project will 1) test the hypothesis that exRNAs have specific features marking them for secretion and uptake, both within and among species, 2) determine how exRNAs are transferred from signaler to receiver cells, and 3) assess the impact of exRNA on microbiome health and composition through examining human gut, insect gut, and leaf surface models.<br/><br/>This project was co-funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Plant Genome Research Program and the Plant Biotic Interactions Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Studying immune responses in the simple roundworm C. elegans provides a powerful method to learn more about immune responses against microsporidia. In the wild, C. elegans is subject to infection by the microsporidian pathogen Nematocida parisii (nematode-killer from Paris), which causes a lethal intestinal infection. The proposed work will study how these pathogens are sensed to induce an immune response. It will involve analysis of how specific cells in the intestine turn on gene expression upon infection and includes comparative studies with collaborators in London, UK, who are studying skin infections in C. elegans caused by natural pathogens called oomycetes, which cause diseases like potato blight. These studies will illuminate how skin and intestinal cells fight off infection individually, how they communicate with the entire animal to induce immune responses, and how an ON/OFF switch called PALS-25/PALS-22 controls these immune responses. Given the ubiquity of microsporidia infections, this work may benefit the agriculture and aquaculture industries. It will train graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in interdisciplinary research, as well as provide opportunities for undergraduates and high school students from underrepresented groups to participate in cutting-edge research. Furthermore, because of the opportunities for dissemination that will be available to students and postdocs in this work, there will be broader impacts in training the next generation of scientists in how to effectively communicate scientific results and build scientific community.<br/><br/>Microsporidia comprise a phylum containing over 1400 species of obligate intracellular fungal pathogens, and most animal species are thought to be susceptible to infection by one or more microsporidia species. However, almost nothing is known about immune responses against these pathogens, which often infect epithelial cells. Indeed, there is much to be learned about epithelial cell immunity in general, which are on the front lines of defense. The nematode C. elegans relies heavily on epithelial defense, as it has no known professional immune cells like macrophages or T cells. In the wild, microsporidia appear to be a very common cause of infection for C. elegans, and one species in particular called Nematocida parisii (nematode-killer from Paris) is the most common species found naturally infecting C. elegans. N. parisii infects C. elegans intestinal epithelial cells, where it induces a transcriptional immune response named the Intracellular Pathogen Response (IPR). Through genetic screens, an ON/OFF switch for the IPR called PALS-25/PALS-22 was identified both by the Troemel lab, as well as by the lab of collaborator Dr. Barkoulas who independently identified PALS-25/PALS-22 as an ON/OFF switch of an immune response to infection by oomycetes, which are natural pathogens of the C. elegans epidermis. This response has been named the Oomycete Recognition Response or ORR. This study aims to: 1) perform paired genetic screens to compare regulators of the IPR and ORR, 2) analyze tissue-specificity of the IPR and ORR, and 3) assess IPR and ORR triggers for their effects on PALS-22/PALS-25 interactions. This collaborative US/UK project is supported by the US National Science Foundation and the UK Biotechnology and Biological Sciences Research Council.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Age effects have long been discussed in the language acquisition literature. Some have argued that native speaker attainment of a language is impossible if acquisition starts later in life (after puberty). Research on heritage language acquisition provides a new perspective on this debate. Heritage speakers acquire a minority language at home from birth in a setting where the majority language is spoken in the community. Due to the extensive use of the majority language in the society growing up, heritage speakers often have fewer opportunities to interact with their minority (heritage) language and receive overall less linguistic input in the heritage language than a typically developing monolingual speaker in the home country. As a result, non-native-like attainment in several properties of their heritage language is common. This has been taken as evidence that early age of acquisition is a necessary but not a sufficient factor for native-like attainment because linguistic input received in the heritage language in early years plays a role as well. This study examines how age and input factors interact in language acquisition processes and in ultimate attainment.<br/><br/>The investigators compare heritage speakers across two different immigrant contexts to returnees who have returned to their country of origin in their adolescence or adult years. Comparing the linguistic abilities of returnees in their former heritage language to that of heritage speakers in the host country informs whether interrupted acquisition before puberty can result in nativelike attainment if heritage speakers become fully immersed in the heritage language after returning to the home country. We also investigate whether the situational factors (e.g., status of and contact with the former majority language, socio-economic status, educational profile) play a role in the degree and speed of development of the heritage language in returnees. To this end, the study obtains production and linguistic judgment data from participants. The results of this project contributes to the limited literature on language identity and linguistic self-esteem in child and adult speakers of a minority language and their reinsertion in their native language and culture. The findings also inform pedagogical interventions in heritage language teaching and the design of teaching materials for heritage speakers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

For rainfall to pass through the forest canopy, it must drain along two ?hydrologic highways?: throughfall (water that drips through gaps and from leaves or bark); and stemflow (water that runs down stems). As throughfall and stemflow drain, they wash particles from leaves and bark. Although tiny, particles washed from the canopy by these hydrologic highways can constitute a significant chemical input to the soil, and represent a wide range of materials, from nutrients to pollutants. Despite this, no large-scale effort has sought to measure, scale, and predict the amount and quality of particles descending down these hydrologic highways. These particles are generally ?missing? from current ecological theory of how forests cycle elements. This study seeks to fill this gap by monitoring storm conditions, throughfall, stemflow, and the particles in these hydrologic highways across sites representing major forest types in North America. Results will link throughfall and stemflow to common models used to inform freshwater and forest management. Outcomes will inform outreach efforts, including science comics and illustration exhibits, open-access articles written for (and reviewed by) primary and secondary school children with Frontiers for Young Minds, and YouTube videos with MinuteEarth, a channel with an international viewership of millions. The project will also provide research experiences to members of underrepresented groups to broaden participation in science.<br/><br/>For 40% of the North American continent and one-third of global land surface, rainfall must pass through forests to reach the soil surface. This rainfall is partitioned by the forest canopy into two net rainfall fluxes: a drip flux called throughfall (TF), and a flow of water down stems, called stemflow (SF). How much rain travels along these hydrologic highways can alter water supply by 20-50%, and what they carry from the canopy can supply >100 kg per hectare of various materials to the soil surface each year. These canopy ecohydrological processes are on the front line of climate and land use change, being that the forest-rainfall interactions that initiate terrestrial hydrological pathways and supply nutrients/pollutants to the surface are the first ecosystem elements impacted by hydrologic intensification. Ignoring these fluxes, and their particulate traffic, introduces error in water and nutrient flux models at the first point where terrestrial biogeochemistry and hydrological cycles entwine, and which may cascade those errors through downgradient processes. This project aims to extend current macrosystem biological understanding to include throughfall and stemflow particulate concentrations, fluxes and composition, specifically addressing 3 major objectives: (1) estimate the net rainfall (TF+SF) water and particulate mass flux across forest types; (2) characterize the particulate composition (C:N:P, including C components like total C, organic C, black C, and microplastic C) of TF and SF; and (3) identify major drivers of macrosystem variability in net rainfall particulate flux and composition. Field monitoring of the above variables across 11 sites of the National Ecological Observatory Network representing the major US forest domains allows links to be tested between existing functional characteristics and the practical integration of throughfall and stemflow dynamics into continental-to-global scale biogeophysical models. The project will also support research training of a postdoctoral researcher, masters and doctoral students, and a technician.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This is partly due to increased access to detailed micro-level data sets, increased and cheaper computing power, and partly due to growing concerns among policymakers about inequality. While much progress has been made in both theory and empirical methods of understanding the links between inequality and aggregate economic activity, current statistical methods used by academic researchers, central banks, and other policy institutions are not designed to account for these differences.  This proposal consists of four projects that will develop new and modern econometric tools to improve empirical research on differential effects of macroeconomic outcomes. The project will also develop video materials to educate students and practitioners in these econometric tools.  The results of this research project will improve macroeconomics policies that increase economic growth as well as reduce inequality, thus improve the well-being of the average American. <br/><br/>This CAREER research proposal will use three projects to develop new econometric methods for studying heterogeneity in macroeconomics.  The first project develops an inference procedure with formal coverage that guarantees visualizing multi-dimensional cross-sectional heterogeneity, such as heterogeneity in dynamic response profiles across groups of households or firms. The second project provides a causal reinterpretation of popular methods for estimating temporal heterogeneity and nonlinearities in time series data, such as state- or sign-dependence of impulse responses.  The third project runs a large-scale simulation study of impulse response estimators and provides quantitative recommendations on how to choose between the many available procedures. Finally, the project proposes a plan for developing a collection of interactive educational materials on modern macro-econometric methods.  Besides the contribution to econometric theory, the results of this research project will also improve macroeconomics policies and increase economic growth as well as reduce inequality, thus improve the well-being of the average American.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Polymer grafted nanoparticles represent a paradigm shift in how we fabricate, use, and recycle plastics because these composites have the potential to outperform traditional hybrids (i.e., physical mixtures of polymers and nanoparticles) in terms of strength and toughness. This is because the polymers are directly attached onto nanoparticles, thus ensuring that these materials constitute a chemically fixed mixture of polymers and nanoparticles ? physical mixtures, on the other hand, tend to demix. However, variability in the size of the nanoparticles and their grafts, which is known as dispersity, results in unusual rheological and fracture properties that remain poorly understood. The proposed research will employ molecular simulations, theory, and machine learning to help explain how dispersity causes these properties and how it could be further exploited for discovering materials that surpass the current capabilities of nanocomposites. These research ideas are closely coupled to educational and outreach objectives to enrich the K-12 and undergraduate pipeline for STEM students. For this purpose, the team will create online learning modules for simulations, polymer physics, machine learning, and materials design. Other activities include interdisciplinary training of graduate students through the Predictive Science and Engineering Design Cluster at Northwestern University, sharing of force field and software developments, software commercialization, and new research opportunities for underrepresented student groups.<br/><br/>The Division of Materials Research and the Division of Chemical, Bioengineering, Environmental and Transport Systems contribute funds to this award. The project addresses a critical knowledge gap in understanding how nanoscale interfacial chemistry, confinement and structural variations (grafting density, graft size and core size dispersities) in multi-component polymer-grafted nanoparticles (PGNs) govern dry layer extension and melt layer interdigitation, and consequently the emergent mesoscale ordering, dynamics, and failure mechanisms of PGNs. A barrier towards understanding the underlying molecular mechanisms is that existing computational paradigms, such as molecular simulations, either lack the fidelity or efficiency for predicting the structure, dynamics and hence properties of these systems. This issue will be addressed through a new scale-bridging method that will further coarse-grain PGNs to a nanoparticle level using chemistry-specific upscaling methods, and then use complementary data from finer models at two levels of hierarchy to inform Latent Variable Gaussian Process machine learning models. The adaptive machine learning model will enable rapid query of PGN properties in unexplored parametric spaces. The project encompasses three research thrusts: 1) Derivation of PGN pair potentials for multi-component systems; 2) Investigation of particle size and graft bidispersity effects on structure and rheology; 3) Development of an adaptive machine learning model for multi-objective design of PGNs. Ultimately, this novel framework will result in multicomponent PGNs that will break strength-toughness tradeoffs that hamper traditional nanocomposites. These research activities will also address open questions in materials informatics such as incorporation of categorical variables representing chemical groups in machine learning, finding optimal simulation batch sizes, and quantifying uncertainty due to noisy measurements. Discovering PGNs that exhibit mechanical property enhancements due to colloidal transitions is critical for them to become scalable, processible, and broadly useful as nanocomposites. To enrich the K-12 and undergraduate pipeline for STEM students, the team will create new activities including online learning modules for simulations, polymers, machine learning, and materials design.

Humans cause a large share of challenges in CTS: they close loops, add uncertainty and dynamics, and preclude the use of model-based algorithms for control and optimization. Model-free controllers and algorithms with guarantees of stability, safety, and performance are critically needed in CTS and other industries. The main goal of this project is to advance the design and analysis of model-free optimization algorithms in settings where decision-making problems need to be solved, using real-time information, within a given time prescribed by the decision-making user. Such controllers have a tremendous potential to improve the performance of different applications in CTS but require advances beyond the traditional nonlinear control theory and its smooth feedback tools. The project incorporates collaborations with industry to inform the development of the algorithms with practical limitations imposed by computational processing, limited actuation and sensing, and intermittent communication networks, and cultivates a talent pipeline into important areas of national technology needs. The tools and algorithms developed will be integrated into graduate and undergraduate courses and disseminated through short courses and workshops offered at major conferences.<br/> <br/>The project will synthesize and analyze new classes of model-free fixed-time equilibrium-seeking controllers for decision-making tasks characterized by constrained variational inequalities. In contrast to traditional extremum seeking algorithms, which only achieve exponential convergence to the minimizer of the steady-state input-to-output map of a plant, the algorithms will achieve fixed-time and prescribed-time convergence via new feedback designs that combine super-linear feedback to accelerate convergence from a distance and sub-linear feedback to accelerate convergence near the extremum. The algorithms will be able to solve standard optimization problems, as well as multi-objective decision making problems with a well-defined Nash or Pareto set. The methodology will advance singular perturbation theory and averaging theory, so they are generalized from guaranteeing only asymptotic stability to guaranteeing fixed-time stability. The algorithms will be tested in different CTS applications, including traffic congestion control, model-free leader-follower tracking with time-varying personalized comfort-related payoff functions, and the coordination of connected mobile robotic networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, in the networking research community, the term ?the Internet? refers more specifically to the basic communication infrastructure on which these applications and services have been built. What many find surprising is that while the set of applications and services have changed dramatically over the years, the basic architecture of the Internet itself ? that is, the arrangement of functionality in the communication infrastructure ? has remained almost completely unchanged since it first took shape roughly forty years ago. This lack of change is not by choice; we know many ways the infrastructure could be improved to provide users with better security, privacy, and performance. Instead, the lack of change is because evolving such a large infrastructure is a difficult design challenge in itself. More specifically, any proposal for architectural change in the Internet must meet the twin challenges of: (i) how to deploy the new design without breaking the old, and (ii) how to create incentives so that all the major providers of the infrastructure benefit from this change (or else it is unlikely to happen). This research project aims to overcome these barriers with a design we call the Extensible Internet. If successful, this will not just be a one-time change, but will turn the Internet into a platform that can easily incorporate change on an ongoing basis.<br/> <br/>More technically, this work is built on the central insight that the original Internet architecture?s narrow waist of IP conflated two roles: that of tying all layer-2 (L2) networks together, and that of providing a service model to end hosts. The Extensible Internet separates these two roles by inserting an Interposition Layer between layers L3 and L4 that (i) is built on top of L3, and can use the current L3 without change, and (ii) provide the service model to end hosts. The entire focus of the Extensible Internet design is architecting this new layer so that an extensible set of services ? ranging from secure attestation to improved privacy to multipoint delivery to various other delivery models ? can be seamlessly deployed on top of this Interposition Layer. The research challenges include: how to structure the data path so that it can be both fully flexible and highly efficient; how to structure global services to be highly resilient; and how to feasibly support an evolving yet uniform service model (i.e., supported by all network providers). We will demonstrate the resulting design on various network testbeds, including NSF?s own FABRIC testbed.

They also involve a consequent (e.g., ?they would swim?), which is true given the antecedent. Reasoning about counterfactual conditionals requires thinking about possibilities, and being able to choose among them in a principled manner. Despite the conceptual complexity involved in temporarily imagining falsehoods as true, humans can readily reason about possibilities arising from counterfactual antecedents. This form of reasoning develops fairly late for children, due to the complexity involved in choosing among different possibilities. To further our understanding of these abilities, the researchers analyze children?s use (i.e., their production and understanding) of these sentences, and the kinds of possibilities children are able to reason over when they are thinking of non-actual state of affairs. Developing and practicing children?s counterfactual reasoning abilities is crucial for both critical and scientific thinking, benefiting children?s ability to control variables when testing hypotheses. Counterfactual reasoning is also closely related to emotional and social development, for example, when understanding regret and relief. By understanding which counterfactuals facilitate development, the researchers encourage children at an earlier age, or when they have developmental difficulties, to respond to counterfactual prompts, and thereby foster more complex forms of reasoning.<br/><br/>This doctoral dissertation project answers the following open questions: How do the possibilities arising from counterfactual situations that children think about differ from the ones that adults think about? Do children consider more possibilities than adults when reasoning counterfactually? Finally, do children?s possibilities involve any linguistic and conceptual features which adults do not use? To answer these questions, the researchers conduct five studies. Two studies examine children?s production of counterfactual conditionals ? considering the types of sentences children use, and the ways in which they differ from those of adults, looking at both children?s natural production of counterfactuals (e.g., produced contexts where they are playing or having a casual conversation with a caregiver), as well as production elicited through experimental prompts. The other three studies examine children?s reasoning when hearing counterfactual utterances. The researchers ask targeted experimental questions (e.g., ?If giraffes had fins, could they swim??) and analyze children?s responses to understand the ways in which the possibilities they reason over differ from those of adults.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of the project is to understand the role of extracellular RNA (exRNA) in communication between cells and in shaping the community of microbes, especially bacteria, that live on and inside plants, insects, and humans. These collections of microbes are often referred to as microbiomes and are critical for the health of plants and animals, including humans. A healthy microbiome promotes a healthy immune system, but how healthy microbiomes are maintained is poorly understood. This project will test the hypothesis that RNA secreted by host cells plays a central role in maintaining health both through communication among cells and by modifying the microbiome. RNA is best known for its key role in protein production inside cells, such as in RNA-based COVID vaccines. However, not all RNA encodes proteins, and cells produce more non-coding RNA than coding RNA, some of which is actively pushed into the environment by cells. This secreted RNA appears to be taken up by other cells, including bacteria and fungi, where it could potentially impact their growth. Understanding how exRNAs shape communication between cells and organisms will enable manipulation of exRNA communication in both agriculture and medicine, which will lead to development of environmentally friendly pesticides, as well as treatments that promote formation of healthy microbiomes in both plants and animals. This knowledge will also enable development of diagnostic and therapeutic tools for early detection and/or treatment of disease.<br/><br/>All cellular organisms secrete RNAs. The functions of these extracellular RNAs (exRNAs), however, are poorly understood. Two likely functions are intercellular and interkingdom communication. Open questions abound in exRNA biology: how are exRNAs selected for secretion, how are they targeted to recipient cells, and what are their roles in normal health and organismal fitness? Arabidopsis leaf exRNA isolates are highly enriched in the post-transcriptional modification N6-methyladenosine (m6A) (as compared to total cellular RNA) suggesting that post-transcriptional modifications may tag specific RNAs for export. Consistent with this, human exosomal microRNAs are enriched with m6A (relative to cytosolic microRNAs). Interestingly, a large number of mammalian small non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) that localize to the external cell surface were recently found to harbor specific sialylated glycan modifications. These observations suggest that specific RNA modifications tag RNAs for cellular export and direct entry into appropriate recipient cells. This project will 1) test the hypothesis that exRNAs have specific features marking them for secretion and uptake, both within and among species, 2) determine how exRNAs are transferred from signaler to receiver cells, and 3) assess the impact of exRNA on microbiome health and composition through examining human gut, insect gut, and leaf surface models.<br/><br/>This project was co-funded by the Directorate for Biological Sciences, and the Plant Genome Research Program and the Plant Biotic Interactions Program in the Division of Integrative Organismal Systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Ethnic and linguistic identity are central to human social organization and enable people to identify with other group members without personally knowing each of them. This ""ethnolinguistic identity"" encourages cooperation at a scale that allows humans to solve problems that could not be tackled with a smaller number of people but may also discourage cooperation between groups. Because cooperation is an ongoing source of human ingenuity and conflict today, it is essential to understand the conditions under which it first emerged and was maintained by our forager ancestors. Did populations become separate because they followed different patterns of resource use across the landscape? Was interaction then discouraged because of the development of cultural barriers? To what extent did ancient human groups share information and/or resources while maintaining biological and cultural boundaries? Archaeologists can now combine advances in ancient DNA, computational simulations, and ancient environmental reconstruction with analysis of cultural remains to understand the formation and consequences of ethnolinguistic identities in early human populations. This study enhances career opportunities and provide training for a postdoctoral researcher, graduate students, and undergraduates. By embedding the work in local communities, scientific training will occur within a multicultural research environment that builds essential skills needed for maximizing the benefits of a diverse STEM workforce.<br/> <br/>The research team will conduct research in two regions, where ancient DNA analysis has revealed that forager populations began to maintain separate biological groupings near the end of the last Ice Age cycle. The investigators will develop well-dated cultural and environmental records from sites around and including where ancient DNA has been discovered. The team will conduct new, high-resolution excavations and analyze the remains they recover alongside existing materials excavated using lower resolution methods in the 1970s. This increased detail will enable both datasets to be brought into alignment and maximize their information value to show if cultural remains such as stone artifacts, pigments, bone tools, and beads show evidence of emerging cultural differences between groups known from ancient DNA to have had little biological interaction. Using environmental data, the team will build simulation models of forager resource use to understand how often people would have encountered one another. They will use these models to test if interaction rates or cultural barriers better explain the lack of genetic exchange.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

However, in the networking research community, the term ?the Internet? refers more specifically to the basic communication infrastructure on which these applications and services have been built. What many find surprising is that while the set of applications and services have changed dramatically over the years, the basic architecture of the Internet itself ? that is, the arrangement of functionality in the communication infrastructure ? has remained almost completely unchanged since it first took shape roughly forty years ago. This lack of change is not by choice; we know many ways the infrastructure could be improved to provide users with better security, privacy, and performance. Instead, the lack of change is because evolving such a large infrastructure is a difficult design challenge in itself. More specifically, any proposal for architectural change in the Internet must meet the twin challenges of: (i) how to deploy the new design without breaking the old, and (ii) how to create incentives so that all the major providers of the infrastructure benefit from this change (or else it is unlikely to happen). This research project aims to overcome these barriers with a design we call the Extensible Internet. If successful, this will not just be a one-time change, but will turn the Internet into a platform that can easily incorporate change on an ongoing basis.<br/> <br/>More technically, this work is built on the central insight that the original Internet architecture?s narrow waist of IP conflated two roles: that of tying all layer-2 (L2) networks together, and that of providing a service model to end hosts. The Extensible Internet separates these two roles by inserting an Interposition Layer between layers L3 and L4 that (i) is built on top of L3, and can use the current L3 without change, and (ii) provide the service model to end hosts. The entire focus of the Extensible Internet design is architecting this new layer so that an extensible set of services ? ranging from secure attestation to improved privacy to multipoint delivery to various other delivery models ? can be seamlessly deployed on top of this Interposition Layer. The research challenges include: how to structure the data path so that it can be both fully flexible and highly efficient; how to structure global services to be highly resilient; and how to feasibly support an evolving yet uniform service model (i.e., supported by all network providers). We will demonstrate the resulting design on various network testbeds, including NSF?s own FABRIC testbed. In addition, all software we create in this project will be publicly available and open source.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This need is particularly urgent for mathematics classrooms with students who have been historically marginalized in such spaces. While many instructional improvement efforts have focused on broadening access to mathematical ideas, fewer efforts have paid explicit attention to the ways instructional practices may serve to marginalize students. Supporting teachers in identifying and refining their equitable mathematics instructional practices is a persistent challenge. This project brings together a successful mathematics rubric-based coaching model (MQI Coaching) and an empirically developed observation tool focused on equity-focused instructional practices, the Equity and Access Rubrics for Mathematics Instruction (EAR-MI). The project's work integrates the EAR-MI rubrics into the MQI Coaching model with 24 middle grades mathematics coaches supporting 72 teachers at grades 5-8. The project measures the effects of the coaching model on teachers' beliefs and instructional practices and on students' mathematical achievement and sense of belonging in mathematics. The project also investigates how teachers' attitudes and beliefs impact their participation and what teachers take away from engagement with the coaching model.<br/><br/>The project makes use of a delayed-treatment experimental design to investigate effects on teacher beliefs and practices and student achievement and sense of belonging. A cohort of 14 coaches are randomly selected to participate in the coaching in Years 2 and 3, with the remaining 10 coaches assigned to a business-as-usual model in Year 2 and engaging in the training in Year 3. Coaches engage in a 4-day summer training to become acquainted with the model with coaching cycles and follow-up meetings during the school year. Each coach will engage teachers in 8-10 coaching cycles in treatment years. Data on the nature of the coaching includes logs and surveys from the coaches. Teachers submit surveys related to their beliefs and practices and two lessons each at the start and end of the academic year for analysis. Student assessment data, course grades, and administrative data, combined with survey data from students on classroom belonging and perceptions of ability and confidence in mathematics, are used to describe student outcomes. Teacher outcomes are captured through the analysis of classroom video, surveys about ethnic-racial identity and racial attitudes, beliefs about students and instruction, and beliefs about and efficacy for culturally responsive teaching. The project uses a set of survey measures with established reliability and validity, adapting some instruments to include specific indicators related to the equity and access rubrics. Analysis of the data uses a multi-level model accounting for the clustering of teachers within schools and students within classrooms and schools.<br/><br/>This project is funded by the Discovery Research PreK-12 (DRK-12) Program and the Established Program to Stimulate Competitive Research (EPSCoR). The DRK-12 program seeks to significantly enhance the learning and teaching of science, technology, engineering and mathematics (STEM) by preK-12 students and teachers, through research and development of innovative resources, models and tools. Projects in the DRK-12 program build on fundamental research in STEM education and prior research and development efforts that provide theoretical and empirical justification for proposed projects.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The overarching goal of the project is to understand the role of extracellular RNA (exRNA) in communication between cells and in shaping the community of microbes, especially bacteria, that live on and inside plants, insects, and humans. These collections of microbes are often referred to as microbiomes and are critical for the health of plants and animals, including humans. A healthy microbiome promotes a healthy immune system, but how healthy microbiomes are maintained is poorly understood. This project will test the hypothesis that RNA secreted by host cells plays a central role in maintaining health both through communication among cells and by modifying the microbiome. RNA is best known for its key role in protein production inside cells, such as in RNA-based COVID vaccines. However, not all RNA encodes proteins, and cells produce more non-coding RNA than coding RNA, some of which is actively pushed into the environment by cells. This secreted RNA appears to be taken up by other cells, including bacteria and fungi, where it could potentially impact their growth. Understanding how exRNAs shape communication between cells and organisms will enable manipulation of exRNA communication in both agriculture and medicine, which will lead to development of environmentally friendly pesticides, as well as treatments that promote formation of healthy microbiomes in both plants and animals.

These processes are typically modeled using the statistical mechanics approach, i.e. by considering large systems of interacting particles, where each particle corresponds to a molecule or an individual bacterium. Imprecision of our measurements and dependence of physical processes on many factors are typically described by random perturbations of particles. Large-scale behavior of such models is observed when one looks at the systems from a sufficiently large distance, after a sufficiently long period of time. Universality in this case refers to the fact that such growing interfaces exhibit similar large-scale behavior. Description of this universal behavior gives a better understanding of the real physical processes in nature. Recent breakthroughs in probability theory, particularly in stochastic partial differential equations and integrable probability, have provided the tools to study such mathematical models.<br/><br/>The Kardar-Parisi-Zhang (KPZ) universality arises in non-equilibrium statistical mechanics, when studying limiting behavior of random growing interfaces. On the mathematical level, growing interfaces appear in free energies of directed random polymers, random growth models, interacting particle systems, stochastic Burgers and Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equations, and stochastically perturbed reaction-diffusion equations. Depending on the characteristics of models, two universal objects are conjectured to govern such interfaces: the KPZ equation and the KPZ fixed point. Recent developments in the area of stochastic PDEs allow to prove scaling limits of various discrete systems to singular stochastic PDEs. Moreover, methods of integrable probability (exactly solvable models) provided a complete characterization of the KPZ fixed point. The goal of this project is to study universal scaling limits of such random growing interfaces using these new results.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

A collaborative effort led by a diverse team of political scientists that aims to expand the community of scholars who develop and publish on methods for generating and analyzing qualitative research data, and for combining such techniques with their quantitative counterparts. The project promotes the progress of science by encouraging and empowering researchers from under-represented groups to bring their perspectives to methodological debates and to develop their methodological ideas. The work of these qualitative researchers will enlarge the set of available tools for creating and working with qualitative data, will strengthen the discipline's methodological foundations, and will encourage advancements of the qualitative field. More broadly, the diversification of the community of methods faculty can have important downstream effects as those faculty serve as role models, inspiring the students who work with them to become the next generations of methodological innovators. <br/><br/>This award funds three inaugural Emerging Methodologists Workshop for Qualitative and Multi-Method Explanatory Research (EMW-QMER) will be held in Fall 2023, 2024, and 2025. At each workshop, six advanced graduate students and junior faculty from under-represented groups will present and receive feedback on a paper they have written on methods for collecting, generating, or analyzing qualitative data, and/or strategies for integrating qualitative and quantitative methods. The workshops will be attended by political scientists interested in developing, publishing on, and teaching qualitative and multi-method research. Project personnel and a broad team of senior scholars recruited to serve as mentors for each presenter will offer intensive support, introducing presenters into networks and working to build an inclusive community. The initiative will bring new voices, perspectives, and ideas to the development of methods for generating and analyzing qualitative data, and for integrating qualitative and quantitative techniques. As more scholars from under-represented groups innovate methodologically and publish their work, their contributions will broaden, diversify, and thus enrich the research community focused on developing such approaches. Ultimately a multiplier effect is anticipated through which undergraduate and graduate students from under-represented groups are increasingly motivated to develop their own ideas about research methods because they see faculty to whom they can closely relate writing on, teaching, and leading organizations dedicated to such methods.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will bring together faculty representatives from four regional IBL communities: the Maryland-DC-Virginia IBL Consortium, Michigan IBL Consortium, Midwest Regional IBL Community, and the New England IBL in Mathematics Consortium.  These faculty representatives will work together to investigate the potential for regional communities of IBL practitioners to support faculty in adopting, sustaining, and promoting the use of IBL in undergraduate mathematics education. This IBL Communities model will provide the ongoing support that instructors need to successfully adopt and sustain IBL strategies in the classroom. Furthermore, regional IBL communities have the potential to broadly impact mathematics education by creating synergy among diverse groups of IBL practitioners who will in turn garner support for IBL among other faculty, administrators, policy makers, and funders across each region. <br/><br/>The overarching goal of the project is to provide targeted support to nurture the growth of the four regional IBL communities represented on the project team and to investigate the impact of these communities in each region.  The expectation is that the project's investigations will elucidate which community-building strategies are most effective in supporting faculty to adopt, sustain, and promote the use of IBL in undergraduate mathematics education. In support of this goal, the project team will collaborate with leaders in each of the four regions to pursue the following objectives: 1) establish and coordinate a Network of IBL Communities; 2) plan and implement regional IBL Communities workshops; 3) facilitate the planning and implementation of peer-collaboration activities in the regional IBL communities; 4) broaden participation in the regional IBL communities among faculty from groups that are underrepresented in STEM as well as among faculty from institution types that are underrepresented in the national IBL community; and 5) investigate the ability of regional IBL communities to provide faculty with the professional support they need to adopt, sustain, and promote IBL.

The seasonality of cardiovascular diseases and influenza demonstrates the importance of stabilizing our thermal environments. However, because of its necessity, indoor temperature control is also associated with enormous energy consumption and carbon emission. This proposed work aims to break the health-energy dilemma by developing a wearable radiative thermoregulation device that can localize heat management around the human body. Like a chameleon that can change its visible color, the wearable device can act like a second skin that changes the level of radiative heat loss into the environment to offset the adverse ambient temperature change. The thermal radiation is tuned by an electrochemical reaction that uses less than 1 V as operation voltage. This working principle is similar to a battery but with the focus on its mid-infrared optical property change. Like a battery that can maintain its state of charge for a long time, the device can also maintain its heating/cooling state with ultralow energy consumption, which is orders of magnitude more efficient than traditional active devices such as electric blankets. To promote diversity, equity, and inclusion, the project will organize the annual workshop series called LITE (Light, Infrared, and Thermal Energy) for underrepresented students by collaborating with the Step Up to STEM program at North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics. The workshop series aims to inspire high schoolers? interest in photonics, thermal science, and general STEM fields by providing introductory lectures and immersive hands-on experiments such as thermal vision VR goggle DIY sessions.<br/> <br/>In photonic technical terms, the device adopts a metal-insulator-metal configuration and the working principle of a midinfrared metamaterial perfect absorber. It uses electrochromic conjugated polymer, such as polyaniline, as the active material. By electrochemically biasing the polymer, its carrier density, plasmon frequency, and permittivity are tuned dynamically and reversibly, thus varying the device state between a metamaterial absorber and a simple metallic reflector, which is equivalent to emissivity tuning based on the Kirchhoff?s law of thermal radiation and the zero transmittance. This project will involve multiscale and multidisciplinary study in materials science, photonics, heat transfer, and wearable device engineering. Specifically, the project will develop the correlation among polymer synthesis condition, structural characterization, charge transport measurement, mid-infrared permittivity, metamaterial absorber designs, and heat transfer measurement. The proposed research will scale up the adaptive metamaterial absorber and implement Kirigami paper cutting technique to provide stretchability, breathability, and conformal deformability from 2D thin film to 3D shapes for wearable applications. The wearable metasurface thermoregulation will further advance the emerging field of multimodal and multispectral light and heat management for the health-energy nexus. The in-depth study of electrochemically active polymers will also become an enabler for adaptive optical metasurfaces, sustainable energy science, and personalized preventive medicine.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Some network updates are planned while others are unplanned and automated. Since network updates can take seconds or minutes to complete, and cloud-computing networks must be ""always on"", updates must be efficient and transparent. Researchers have proposed various abstractions for network updating that leverage advances in formal methods to synthesize update plans and protocols, ensuring that the system remains well-behaved during an ongoing update. However, despite several high-profile cases of network updates gone wrong, operators continue to use relatively naive approaches. We investigate key shortcomings of prior work on update abstractions that limit their utility and widespread use in practice, and develop a new abstraction that addresses the heterogeneity, scale, and dynamic nature of real-world updates. The project's novelties are (1) a new game-theoretic foundation for network updates, (2) algorithms for synthesizing update controllers that are robust to failures and changing conditions during the update, (3) algorithms for explaining update failures, (4) a language design that allows synthesized controllers to be safely modified, and (5) implementations and evaluations of these mechanisms for virtual network functions and serverless-computing platforms. The project provides network operators with tools that make updates to networked systems easier, safer, and more reliable, and develops a framework that makes datacenter computing more reliable and secure.<br/><br/>Some specific key shortcomings of previous work on network updates are the following. (1) They assume that the network behaves predictably during the update. However, at scale, network demands and concurrent updates can cause unpredictable or even adversarial behavior in response to the update. (2) They have limited explanatory power when an update plan cannot be found or cannot be completed. (3) They make it hard for operators to choose between alternative update plans. This project consists of a comprehensive research plan to address these shortcomings. The key technical innovation is a formulation of updates as the search for a winning strategy in a two-player game, between the operator (or control plane) and the network. This formulation allows a uniform modeling of key elements, including hardware and software failures, variations in demand, and the addition and removal of network elements. To produce updates that are robust to changing conditions and failures, this work uses program-synthesis techniques to automatically generate an update controller that corresponds to a winning strategy in the game. To help operators when fatal errors occur, the project develops algorithms that exploit this game-theoretic formulation to explain the root cause of update failures and present alternatives. Finally, to give operators more control over updates, the investigators develop approaches for synthesizing update controllers that are interpretable and modifiable. The game-theoretic formulation is applicable to several kinds of networked systems, and the project will instantiate and evaluate our tools for platforms that implement virtual network functions and serverless functions.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These benefits, or ecosystem services, are estimated to save urban residents billions of dollars annually. Increasingly, cities rely on digital technologies to monitor, plan, and manage urban forests and their ecosystem services. In theory, digital technologies aid in urban forest management decisions that improve environmental and human well-being. In practice, it remains unclear by whom, how, and in what context these technologies are implemented and the resultant outcomes. This award aims to understand to what extent digital technologies: (1) facilitate equitable access to tree-based ecosystem services; (2) involve urban residents in decision-making processes surrounding urban forests; and (3) represent peoples? values and preferences for urban trees. The overarching goal of the project is to improve urban forest sustainability and equity at the human-technology frontier.<br/><br/>Given the significant role of technology in urban green infrastructure planning and development, urban forests have become a locus of interactions and feedbacks between social, ecological, and technological systems. In cities worldwide, decision makers rely heavily on urban forest assessment and valuation tools to quantify the ecological structure (e.g., tree canopy), function (e.g., air pollution removal), and economic value (i.e., dollars saved) of urban forests. Recent advances allow users to prioritize areas within cities for tree planting, further guiding decision-making processes. Thus, digital forest technologies have the potential to influence access to urban trees and their benefits (distributional justice), participation in decisions surrounding urban forests (procedural and recognition justice), and equity through prioritization of certain values over others (recognition justice). This award asks: How can urban forest assessment and valuation tools integrate equity concerns and participatory processes to support procedural, recognition, and distributional justice in urban forestry? Using i-Tree as a model system, this award will investigate the mechanisms by which digital tools influence forest governance and equity (i.e., through participation and recognition) and potential canopy pollution removal (i.e., through benefits estimates and area prioritizations). Research will be conducted in multiple cities using a multi-scalar, mixed methods approach, including institutional analysis, survey and interview questions designed to facilitate participatory processes, leaf particulate matter sampling, and geospatial analysis using Geographic Information Systems (GIS), remote sensing, and land use regression modeling. The project draws on frameworks, approaches, and technologies from social science, ecology, geospatial science, and visual design to better understand the development and implications of human-technology partnerships in urban forest planning and management. Further, by creatively integrating environmental justice into a major model system for urban forest assessment and valuation, results could provide an example roadmap for other cities to follow, potentially transforming urban forest planning and management into a more just system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This award will explore how forests have been managed and sustained over millennia through exploring the human knowledge of these interactions. This award will explore the forest?s dynamics using: formal technical or ?Western? scientific and Indigenous Knowledge (defined here by local ancestral knowledge held by Indigenous communities) approaches and understanding. This study will rigorously assess forest disturbance history and model forest climate sensitivity in neotropical conifer forests using western methods from tree-ring studies and understanding how climatic risks are perceived by indigenous forest managers, the forest management systems in place led by indigenous communities, to understand how Indigenous Knowledge is applied to forest management in these communities and how this knowledge acquisition and transmission could be modified by social changes including migration, and how this relates to the existing body of Indigenous Knowledge. The project includes a range of broader impacts related to education, training, and co-production of knowledge focused on building local capacity and generating information that can be applied to study the range of variability in the coupled socio-environmental system of forests conserved by Indigenous communities. <br/><br/>Forest ecosystems are a critical component of the biosphere and play an important role in coupling the atmosphere to the land surface and carbon cycle. These environments also shelter, sustain, and provide ecosystem goods and services, including carbon sequestration and water resources, for human societies at scales from local to global. Forests are fully integrated socio-environmental systems that reflect reciprocal interactions, exchanges, and feedbacks between biosphere, atmosphere, and human society. Terrestrial protected areas and ecologically intact landscapes are conserved and managed by indigenous peoples, but imminent climate disruption and changes in forest disturbance regimes threaten the state of ecosystems and the human livelihoods that both depend on and affect them. Indigenous Knowledge reflects holistic accumulated understanding of the system by indigenous communities; however, migration and other social and cultural changes have altered the modes of transmission of environmental knowledge in these communities. How does modern Indigenous Knowledge integrate centuries of socio-environmental interactions and experiences and how will that knowledge system change in the face of social and environmental systems that will imminently shift beyond the variability of the last several centuries? This research approach combines a long-term understanding of past, present, and future forest history and disturbance from dendrochronology, novel insights into indigenous management and conservation practices through time, an understanding of traditional environmental knowledge dynamics, scale, and change, and forecasts of future socio-ecological change. This project seeks to understand how indigenous knowledge of forest dynamics reflect centuries of ecosystem variability and how non-stationarity in both the human and ecological components of this coupled system will affect management, conservation, and preservation of this socio-ecological system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This area has gone through major progress in recent years, and the PI has been working towards a deeper understanding and further development of the new tools and techniques. The project also includes classical enumeration problems on several discrete structures that are closely related to computer science.

Technologies that are central to this - subsurface remediation, geothermal energy systems, batteries, fracking, etc. - are governed by complicated flow through porous media, which is not currently well understood. A porous medium has multiple, convoluted pathways of various sizes for fluid flow through an otherwise solid material. The flows can be single phase (liquid/gas) or multiphase, and can occur at constant temperature or with heat transfer. The flow can occur in a single direction, or oscillate. When all of these are combined, nonlinear effects can result, which could improve the behavior of a system or negatively impact performance, depending on how the effects are propagated and understood. The major objective of this work is to experimentally study oscillating and multiphase flows in porous media, and then develop a numerical approach that can be used to gain further insight into the fundamental behavior, thereby improving energy efficiency, and lowering both economic costs and environmental impacts. Although porous media flow sounds esoteric, it occurs in many daily applications (brewing coffee, etc.). Therefore, this project is well suited for pre-college outreach, and several topics related to it will be used to engage underrepresented students from K-12 classrooms. In addition, this project will promote STEM education via an inter-college educational collaboration for undergraduate design projects, and demonstration units about porous media flows will be created for pre-college classrooms.<br/><br/>This research will combine experimental and numerical techniques to describe the effects of the physical porous structure, the flow/heat transfer boundary layer (including a comparison between oscillation and non-oscillation) and the variations in wettability from materials and manufacturing process. Experimentally, naturally-occurring and engineered porous media will be scanned, analyzed, and catalogued in a database, and an experimental platform will also be designed and developed to study in situ oscillating and multiphase transport phenomena inside porous media using the Neutron Imaging Facility at Oak Ridge National Lab. This experimental work will be coupled with numerical simulations through parallel development of a multiphase discrete Boltzmann method model and a hybrid discrete/lattice Boltzmann method model to capture kinetic behaviors and multiscale interactions, in order to elucidate the fundamental behavior of oscillating multiphase thermofluidic phenomena and fluid-solid interactions. The knowledge developed in this project will, in turn, be used to improve the design of porous structures in a variety of energy applications, including thermal storage in concentrated solar power plants, carbon retention in rock structures, and fuel cells.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Also, NFC signals can efficiently penetrate through various materials and provide a reliable communication channel. Nowadays, NFC tags have been used in retail, medical, clothing industry, and agriculture among others. However, due to the limited communication range, these tags are usually scanned manually, which cannot support automatic IoT applications. This project aims to develop a long-range NFC system that can read ultra-dense NFC tags autonomously using mobile robots.

OUD includes physical dependency and neural adaptations in brain circuits of reward and motivation, self-regulation, and stress reactivity that can persist years after drug discontinuation. Substance craving is one of the primary causes of OUD patient's relapse. Studies have shown psychological cues such as stress, anxiety, and arousal can precipitate the cultivation of drug craving. Research has found that mindfulness-based strategies reduce cravings, psychological cues and prevent relapse. Mindfulness-based interventions (MBIs) bring about clinically relevant changes to physiological arousal, stress, and addictive behavior through cognitive behavioral skill development.

In particular, the research tasks focus on there areas. First, effective physiological feature identification and extraction to detect craving that is generalizable across large OUD populations and consider the external factors such as age, gender, drug use habits, etc. Second, development of an effective multi-modal sensing integration approach to capture psychological craving cues (e.g., stress, arousal) from a combination of acoustic and physiological sensing. This will include novel multiple instance (MIL) multitask learning based classification techniques that are scalable with near real-time performance. The study will address the fundamental gaps of indoor craving-relevant sensing where only a small fraction of a long signal may convey information relevant to the targeted emotional state/class. The last task will include development of a craving context-aware MBI recommender system that models the dynamic nature of OUD subjects craving-interventions and feedbacks.

This technology has been developing rapidly but is still limited in practical use due to its high operating temperature. Reducing the SOFC operation temperature towards its widespread applications has triggered an intensive search of super ionic conducting solid oxides. Introducing defects, such as dislocations, into certain oxides has been demonstrated to be promising in achieving a considerably high ionic conductivity at low temperature but this technique is still in a ""trial and error"" stage due to lack of knowledge on how ions hop under the effects of the defect-induced stress field in plastically deformed solid oxides. To meet this need, this award supports fundamental research on computer simulations of ions hopping in defected solid oxides, across a wide range of length scales. The gained knowledge may be utilized in the development of not only low temperature SOFCs, but also lithium/sodium-ion batteries, perovskite solar cells, corrosion-resistant materials for medical implants, and radiation-resistant materials for nuclear power plants. This project is multidisciplinary in nature. The participating students will be exposed to a broad range of scientific knowledge, methodology, and skills. A mentoring program that links the education of graduate, undergraduate, and high-school students will be fostered. <br/><br/>The high operation temperature in SOFC stems from the high ion migration barrier (~1eV) in solid oxides. Distinct from traditional approaches that overcome this barrier by exposing the materials to an elevated temperature, this project presents a plan on promoting ionic transport using severe stress localizations in plastically deformed solid oxides. The local stress's contribution to the ion migration barrier reduction will be quantified through a series of concurrent atomistic-continuum (CAC) simulations. Polycrystalline strontium titanate and multilayered strontium titanate /magnesium oxide containing a high density of grain boundaries (GBs) and phase boundaries (PBs) will be chosen as the model materials. The CAC simulations will bridge the relevant length scales through resolving the GBs and PBs at an atomistic resolution while the dislocations away from them will be dealt in a coarse-grained description. This will enable a prediction of the microscopic-level ionic transport in strained solid oxides without smearing out the atomistic nature of ion hopping near the material defects. Data and insights regarding diffusion under stress, which controls the kinetics of phase transformations, oxidation, creep, and many other engineering processes in solid materials, will be generated.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Over time, this material is transported along the shore (to nourish beaches) and/or offshore (to form deeper-water mud patches). Some of the highest rates of coastal erosion occur in the Arctic because ground containing permafrost thaws easily under the influence of warm ocean water and wave attack. But once that sediment enters the Arctic Ocean, we know very little about where it goes. Studies of sediment transport have been a critical part of coastal management and geologic inquiry for the past several decades but have focused on temperate and tropical environments not impacted by seasonal sea ice. We have a critical need to expand these studies to the Arctic in order to improve our understanding of the fate of sediments, which can re-shape coastlines, change the character of the seabed, and transfer nutrients from land to ocean. This research is timely in light of accelerating coastal erosion associated with reductions in seasonal sea-ice extent and intensifying wave energy, trends which are forecast to continue. This study is designed to determine the primary pathways of sediments in the coastal ocean during the open-water season, when frequent wind storms are expected to mobilize sediments recently delivered to the seabed. Measurements will include particle concentrations, sediment migration on time scales of seconds to months, seabed composition, and seabed geotechnical properties. These data will be used to model how the Alaskan continental shelf may evolve over thousand-year timescales in response to changing shorelines and wave conditions. This project will be tackled by a team of researchers with field, geotechnical, and modeling expertise. Networking with local communities, training of graduate students, and engagement with undergraduates at the University of North Carolina through classes as well as programs aimed at introducing students from underrepresented groups to scientific research are planned.<br/><br/>Accelerating coastal erosion is one of the critical environmental changes occurring in the Arctic and is associated with intensifying wave climates driven by annual reductions in sea-ice extent. At present, parts of the Alaskan Arctic coastline are experiencing some of the greatest rates of coastal erosion worldwide. These rates are accelerating, representing an increased source term of sediment and associated nutrients into the coastal ocean. While studies of continental shelf dynamics have provided great insights to sediment transport at temperate and tropical latitudes, we know relatively little about the pathways of sediment on Arctic continental shelves. These remote environments are shrouded by ice for up to nine months of the year and experience unique processes like ice pressure-ridge formation, disturbance of the seabed by anchor-ice growth, and 'strudel scour' during breakup. These processes can confound traditional seabed signatures of sediment accumulation. Thus, this project proposes to pair measurements of seabed properties with dynamic measurements of sediment fluxes within the water column during the storm season to determine the key mechanisms and pathways of sediment flux. Field data will be used to drive morphostatic and morphodynamic models of shelf profile evolution to determine feedbacks between wave propagation, erosion, and changes in the shelf profile over millennial timescales. The field site encompasses Harrison Bay and the adjacent shelf, which receives sediment from rapidly retreating bluffs and the Colville River.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

This project systematically examines the potential disconnects between consumers? privacy expectations when interacting with mobile health apps, privacy perspectives and behaviors of health apps? developers, the privacy protections afforded by the law and relevant privacy policies, and the actual data handling practices of such apps. The research team is addressing identified disconnects by demonstrating new methods of communicating privacy information to developers and users.

They are needed to adapt to and plan for present and future change, both in the Arctic and for the rest of the planet. Climate models show that warming temperatures and Arctic sea ice loss will continue with increasing greenhouse gas concentrations. However, these models show large differences in the rate of warming and sea ice loss. These model differences largely come from imperfect representation of the interactions among the atmosphere, sea ice, and ocean. One of the key interactions is the reflection of sunlight by sea ice. In the spring, sea ice is snow-covered and reflects 85% of sunlight keeping the surface cool. However, moving into summer, the ice melts and the amount of sunlight reflected decreases, warming the surface resulting in more melt. It is critical to accurately represent this process in models. This project will combine observations and climate models to better simulate the processes controlling the interaction of sunlight and sea ice and their impact on sea ice melt. This modeling effort will lead to refined representation of sea ice in climate models, which will improve predictions of sea ice loss and global warming.<br/><br/>This project will use observations from the Multidisciplinary drifting Observatory for the Study of Arctic Climate (MOSAiC) field campaign (Oct 2019 - Sept 2020) to improve key parameterizations for simulating sea ice physics and feedbacks through the analysis of relevant, process-oriented observations to enhance the predictive skill of climate models. It will focus on building model parameterizations that more accurately represent the variability of ice-albedo feedback processes. The methods include the integration of spatially and temporally coordinated field observations, single column modeling, and global climate modeling. We will synthesize field observations to produce a complete forcing/test dataset and iterate with single column modeling to develop parameterizations that improve the treatment of the spatial distribution of snow and melt ponds, light transmittance through sea ice, and responses to events such as summer snowfall and rain-on-snow events. Parameterizations will be incorporated in an open-source community climate model and used to evaluate improvements in sea ice predictability.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The project will promote the development of strong ethical sensitivity and reasoning skills within students (i.e. ethical competence), and it will promote the establishment of ethical competence as a core competence associated with the engineer identity. The research team will also develop an instrument to measure the proposed ethical component of the engineer identity. The extant literature provides little information regarding the development of engineering ethics as a component of the engineer identity or strategies to measure it. In addition, very little of the related literature incorporates ethics in relation to engineer identity in any way. The proposed research directly addresses these significant and problematic gaps by assessing the effects of integrating professional ethics education into student internships on students' development of an ethical engineer identity. During the last year of the award, the research team will lead workshops to train faculty at both the Florida Polytechnic University and the University of South Florida, on how to conduct the ethics workshops themselves, enabling the sustainability of the pedagogical model and promoting transferability of the intervention to other diverse institutions.<br/><br/>This project proposes to address the following pair of research questions. To what extent do students' pre-existing attitudes, values, and goals related to ethics and perceptions of the ethical responsibility of engineers change with involvement in professional engineering ethics training? How might instruction in professional engineering ethics, coupled with a co-curricular internship experience, enhance development of the ethical component of a student's professional engineer identity? To address these questions, the researchers will engage in a multi-method study with engineering students at the Florida Polytechnic University, which has a very structured, compulsory internship program ideally suited for the proposed intervention. The intervention involves enhanced student internships, with workshops focused on critical analyses of ethical case studies immediately prior to the internship experience. Post internship, they will measure the collective impact on students' ethical engineer identity using qualitative content analysis of student essays and online surveys. The results of this project will contribute to engineering ethics pedagogy and develops additional ethics measures for engineer identity research. The project will explicitly expand the intervention to engineering students at neighboring University of South Florida, a much larger metropolitan research-oriented university without a formal internship program.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Using AI can help systems adapt to specific people's goals and abilities; however, AI systems typically require collecting data and making guesses about their users, both of which can be intrusive and cause harms.  For instance, AI systems sometimes make wrong inferences about personal, sensitive characteristics that can cause both psychological harm and affect people's access to systems; the data collected can also be used in unwanted ways, such as large facial recognition databases assembled without people's consent.  These harms often happen, even when system designers are well-intentioned, because current design practice provides little specific guidance on how to reason about possible harms.  This project will tackle this problem by creating design methods and guidelines that highlight potential privacy issues and design choices that often increase these risks.  Student and industry researcher involvement in the development and evaluation of the methods will give the work both direct educational impact and increase the chance that future AI-based systems will make informed choices around privacy and safety risks.<br/><br/>The specific method proposed is called Privacy through Design (PtD), a novel research methodology to help creators of consumer-facing AI technologies: (i) model how acute, use-case specific privacy concerns among end-users among stakeholders trade off against the envisioned utility or value of proposed AI concepts; and, (ii) understand how to (re-)design those concepts in a manner that respects stakeholders' privacy concerns of while retaining the envisioned utility of the design.  Doing this work makes three main scientific contributions.  The first is to develop a taxonomy of algorithmic privacy intrusions to operationalize the unique privacy harms entailed by consumer AI and map those harms onto the unique capabilities and requirements of AI systems. This second is to develop PtD using an iterative methodology incorporating experts and practitioners in industry and academia. The third is to formally evaluate how products developed through PtD compare to those developed through existing industry standards for designing consumer AI technologies.  Two key envisioned outputs are a repository of design cases in which privacy concerns emerge and are resolved, and a guidebook with worksheets and recommendations to help creators of consumer AI technologies center consideration of privacy in their design processes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

It exacerbates the pressure on the rapidly-dwindling radio frequency (RF) spectrum. Visible light communication (VLC) emerges as a promising wireless technology to mitigate the pressure on the RF spectrum. It turns ubiquitous sources of artificial light into wireless access points, promising unparalleled communication bandwidth. Existing VLC research, however, is fundamentally shackled by the limits of light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Their slow response time and low spectral efficiency have resulted in either moderate data rates or centimeter-level transmission distances. The project aims to overcome this limit. It studies the use of diffused laser light as the next-generation transmission medium while qualitatively boosting practical VLC performance to the next level. <br/><br/>The project envisions that future indoor (e.g., offices, homes) and outdoor (e.g., car headlights, street lamps) illumination will gradually take advantage of laser diodes because of their superior illumination efficiency. Multiple collocated laser diodes emit light at different wavelengths that are mixed and diffused to generate diffuse white light. The same diffused white light is reused to transmit data at ultra-high speeds, thanks to laser diode's unique properties of high modulation bandwidth and spectrum efficiency. Diffusing laser light not only makes laser light safe for illumination but also mitigates the alignment issues faced by conventional free-space laser communication. Proposed research tackles networking, systems, and optics issues in jointly utilizing diffused laser light for both normal illumination and high-speed, reliable communication, which sets a key departure from prior works that study laser light communication and illumination in isolation. It addresses key research questions including how to build efficient and robust communication link with diffused laser light, how to reconcile the illumination and communication functionality of laser light, and how to leverage links with diffuse laser light for expanded coverage and support of user mobility. The proposed work, if successful, will represent a major paradigm shift in VLC and establish crucial systems pieces to overcome key barriers in systems, networking, and optics to bring VLC links in gigabit data rate range to practical systems.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Most networks change over time and are often called temporal or dynamic networks. In this project, a framework for modeling and analyzing dynamic networks that change continuously over time will be developed, even though the networks may only be periodically observed. This framework advances the interdisciplinary field of network science along with the computer and information sciences by developing models to separate the underlying dynamics of the networks from the times at which the networks are observed. The framework can be applied to analyze dynamic network data in many scientific disciplines and in public health applications, including networks of face-to-face interactions between people, which can help scientists better understand the spread of infectious diseases such as COVID-19. This project advances education in network science by creating a curriculum for instruction of dynamic networks at the undergraduate and graduate levels. The project also trains new graduate and undergraduate students, including female students from the University of Toledo's ACM-W chapter, in interdisciplinary data science research. Finally, the project develops and integrates methods for analyzing dynamic networks into the open-source DyNetworkX Python package to reach others who could use them in impactful ways.<br/><br/>Temporal dynamics in networks are known to provide crucial information about the underlying complex systems being modeled by the networks. While significant advances have been made towards understanding the structure of static networks, dynamics are usually incorporated in an ad-hoc manner by creating discrete time snapshots aggregated over some arbitrary time period, primarily for convenience of analysis. The goal of this project is to develop a unified framework for model-based analysis of dynamic networks using continuous-time models that can be applied to both discrete- and continuous-time dynamic network data. Towards this goal, the research team will target five specific aims: 1) learning continuous-time network models from aggregated counts of relational events over time, 2) creating Hawkes process-based generative models for timestamped events with durations, 3) developing kernel smoothing approaches for analyzing dynamic networks, 4) modeling different types of measurement error in dynamic network data, and 5) creating time- and memory-efficient dynamic graph data structures to enable analysis of large dynamic networks with high temporal resolution. Dynamics of networks are given minimal coverage in current network science curricula and textbooks. The model-based analysis techniques to be developed in this project build upon fundamental network theory and empirical observations about real networks and are thus ideal for integration into a typical graduate or undergraduate network science course. The investigator will develop a publicly-available curriculum for instruction on dynamic network representations, models, and analysis methods. The results of this project will provide a glimpse of the possibilities enabled by continuous-time network models and guide future research and education efforts on dynamic networks.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Due to its limited payload and battery time, a single drone cannot support additional payload and its associated accessories required for active sensing. The concept of two leader-follower drones is thus introduced. This award supports fundamental research for the development of a drones-enabled active sensing system through synchronized drone swarming and thermal imaging. The new technique will transform the current passive surface deterioration inspection practice, which is subject to the change in sunlight conditions, into an active thermal imaging inspection for subsurface condition deterioration, such as delamination and horizontal cracks in reinforced concrete structures. In addition to infrastructure inspection and maintenance, the new technique will impact multiple frontiers with cooperative robot swarming and active sensing, such as interactive manufacturing and healthcare, and academic communities in science and engineering. The technique and research results will be transferred into the hands of engineering professionals through a national workshop.<br/><br/>The drones-enabled active sensing system will be investigated via software/hardware-in-the-loop simulations and experimental tests. This research will overcome two technical challenges: (1) to synchronize drone swarming and thermal imaging in an energy-efficient strategy and (2) to enable new thermal imaging detectability with a heat source distributed on a leader-follower drone platform to stimulate the appearance of subsurface defects in active imaging. It will lay a foundation on cooperative robot swarming and active sensing research in multiple frontiers. First, it will develop a new strategy of leader-follower formation for drone swarming with visual relative navigation and collision avoidance based on a three-dimensional stereo vision and potential field algorithm during cooperative active sensing and inspection of subsurface defects in a GPS-denied environment.

The ways these techniques represent data affect what people see in their data: different designs support different statistical insight and can even mislead people by appearing to show patterns that are not there. Designers lack grounded, actionable guidance for when and how their visualizations might most effectively communicate the patterns they see that matter most in their data. This project will work to develop data-driven models, metrics, and tools that describe what people see in a visualization and help them assess what it means and how it can help.

Under these circumstances, change is often not a choice. Cells inevitably find new ways to adapt and survive upon exposure to acute stress. Bacterial cells that are exposed to antibiotics acquire resistance through changes to their DNA sequence. Plants make decisions about their flowering times based on their time of exposure to cold conditions. Cancer cells, when exposed to chemotherapeutic agents, can become resistant, posing a significant challenge to treatment and worsening patient outcomes. In many cases, these adaptive changes are epigenetic - they result in gene expression changes without any alterations to the genetic blueprint. In contrast to genetic mutations, epigenetic changes can be transient, heritable and reversible providing diverse pathways for cellular innovation. The thousands of genes within the nucleus of each cell serve as tunable knobs that can alter cell fitness. We do not understand how cells choose which knobs to turn, and making the wrong choice could prove catastrophic. This NSF-funded research program aims to understand the fundamental rules that shape the inner workings of the cell. This research program captures the chaotic collisions between molecules within a cell which can work in unison to help cells make accurate, adaptive decisions. This project also seeks to broadly impact high school and undergraduate education in Michigan through a unique emphasis on interdisciplinary research and learning. <br/><br/>Understanding the fundamental rules of life that guide cells to make adaptive decisions requires interdisciplinary tools that capture cellular processes across different time and length scales. Because epigenetic changes can occur even without cell division and are not permanent, they lead to a rapid, reversible, and adaptive cellular response that has profound consequences for cell growth and survival. This research uses high-resolution imaging to visualize single molecules in cells, microfluidic platforms to reveal decision making events within individual cells, and automated continuous culture methods to investigate the dynamics of cell populations. The synthesis and integration of these multi-dimensional viewpoints will enable the development of mathematical models with the potential to predict emergent properties of these complex regulatory networks. Ultimately, the outcome of these studies will be a set of rules that define how adaptive epigenetic states, much like genetic mutations, represent evolvable traits in eukaryotic genomes.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The objective of this project is to design an intelligent and automatic broad-spectrum image protection system that offers provable privacy guarantees for multiple parties involved in social image sharing while maintaining image quality. Specifically, the researchers on this project aim to overcome the following challenges: (i) Privacy protection for human subjects and sensitive objects in the background of the images; (ii) Consideration of location-dependent image sensitivities whereby images taken at certain places (e.g., pubs, hospitals) may impact privacy, such as people in the images who do not want their occurrences or co-occurrences at those locations to be known; (iii) Strong enforcement of the privacy protection that conforms with different privacy needs of multiple people in the same image. The success of the proposed research will address the rising privacy concerns of image sharing on social sites and benefit billions of social network users. A range of educational activities will be also carried out including curriculum development, professional training for college students and outreach to K-12 teachers and students, with emphasis on under-represented groups.<br/><br/>This project will greatly advance the state-of-the-art facial privacy protection during online image sharing with the following innovative research ideas. First, a new image privacy policy language and an efficient policy management system will be designed for managing broad-spectrum privacy concerns of multiple parties. Second, formal privacy models will be defined to quantify privacy risks and provide provable privacy guarantees during policy enforcement. Third, new deep-learning-based image modification approaches such as facial modification/replacement and image cropping will be investigated to simultaneously address different users' privacy needs regarding the same image while preserving the aesthetics nature. Finally, a combination of interface and incentive design will be conducted to obtain more accurate user feedback and evaluate the effectiveness and practicality of the proposed system.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

In a hardware-accelerated environment that consists of many diverse execution units, the execution of a program is no longer a conventional thread tied to a single CPU, but a graph of small computations scheduled on a set of hardware accelerators each implementing a part of the program logic. Redshift is a new operating system for developing applications that leverage performance of a heterogeneous hardware-accelerated system.<br/><br/>At the core of Redshift is a dataflow programming model that enables execution of commodity programs on a network of heterogeneous hardware execution units with only minimal modifications. Redshift implements programs as collections of asynchronous invocations that transparently move execution between hardware functions. A novel runtime maps computations to execution units, balances load among them, and scales the hardware graph of computation in response to load. <br/><br/>The problem of efficient computing environments has large impacts on society as a whole: a rapidly growing share of scientific discoveries is done in silico. As this trend continues, we as a society depend on computational capacity of modern computers.

However, the miniaturization and high power densities require enhanced cooling technologies for reliable operation. Two-phase liquid cooling, such as direct evaporation from microscale droplets, utilizes the high latent heat of vaporization to effectively dissipate heat. Evaporation from non-spherical droplets, owing to their larger surface area and meniscus curvature, exhibits very different evaporation rates compared to a spherical droplet. Consequently, cooling rates canbe enhancedby using micro-engineered surfaces to control droplet shapes. This project will establish a theoretical and experimentalbasis forbreakthroughs in two-phase cooling technologies that can unleash the full potential of next-generation electronics used for data centers, electric vehicles, and artificial intelligence. The long-term educational goal of this CAREER project is to integrate project-based research outcomes into education modules and motivate STEM majorsby engaging students from high school to the graduate level in surface engineering and thermal transport research. <br/><br/>This project seeks to identify the different modes of heat and mass transfer during the evaporation of non-axisymmetric microdroplets. While sessile droplet evaporation has been studied extensively over the past hundred years, most of them have only focused on the evaporation of droplets with capped spherical shapes. Consequently, how different evaporation mechanisms are affected by the non-axisymmetric droplet shape and how the droplet geometry is controlled by micro-engineered structures remain unclear. This project seeks to elucidate how the geometry and dimensions of micro-engineered structures affect the contact line dynamics, thermocapillary flow, interfacial transport, and vapor diffusion characteristics for evaporating non-axisymmetric microdroplets. Novel experimental methods will be utilized based on a pressure-controlled microfluidic system, micro-particle image velocimetry, and planar laser induced fluorescence imaging to quantify evaporation mass transport and capture the local flow and temperature patterns. These approaches will advance experimental techniques in thermofluidic fields for probing the transport mechanisms of liquid-vapor two-phase systems, providing insights into liquid-vapor interfacial mass transport, micro-convection, and vapor diffusion during evaporation of non-axisymmetric microdroplets.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Two fundamental barriers in advancing simulation of spray formation are 1) the lack of a comprehensive understanding of the effects of inlet conditions on the destabilization and breakup of liquids; and 2) the extreme computational cost of a high-fidelity simulation that can capture all the physical scales. This project aims to tackle these two challenges by characterizing the impact of inlet conditions on spray formation through high-fidelity simulation. The proposed work will be focused on sprays formed by planar air-blast atomizers to better understand the fundamental fluid dynamics. The physical insights of spray formation processes obtained in the project will assist engineers in developing new techniques to control spray features. The educational plan will be developed in collaboration with Baylor's Mayborn Museum's NSF-funded Portal to the Public program and the Learning Experience (LEx) Labs of the Region 12 Educational Service Center.<br/><br/>The specific objectives of the proposed project are: 1) to characterize through high-fidelity simulation the effects of inlet gas turbulence, asymmetry in the gas inflow velocity, and geometry of gas inlets on interfacial instability and spray formation; 2) to establish a novel sub-grid model based on topological skeletonization of liquid structures; and 3) to create educational activities based on our simulation and modeling research to inspire K-12 students, including those in grades 7-12 and those with physical limitations, to consider a STEM education and career pathway. Former studies were generally limited to basic features of inlet conditions, such as the mean velocity profile, and finer aspects such as inlet turbulence and inlet flow asymmetry are usually assumed to be secondary. This assumption has been challenged by recent experiments and will be systematically examined in this project. The research will provide a comprehensive understanding of the impact of inlet conditions on interfacial instability and spray formation. The skeletonization method, which is widely used in computer graphics, will be employed to develop a novel sub-grid model for spray formation. The surface, curve, and point skeletons, representing micro-scale liquid sheets, filaments, and droplets formed in atomization, will provide a framework to model the unresolved dynamics, deformation, and breakup of these liquid structures.

The project advances catalytic processing technology that upgrades methane to higher-value chemicals in small plants located at or near the production wells, thus avoiding flaring or costly gas pipeline transport.  The catalysts currently employed in this process do not fulfill the activity and stability requirements necessary to make the process economically viable. The study integrates experimental and theoretical methods to better understand the factors limiting current catalyst performance, and uses that knowledge to guide the design of improved catalysts and processing schemes.  The project also promotes training of graduate and undergraduate students in technologies related to efficient, cost-effective, and low environmental impact utilization of hydrocarbon resources, while promoting outreach to predominantly minority schools to attract K-12 students to STEM fields.<br/><br/>This project targets methane dehydroaromatization (MDA) which constitutes a path for the direct conversion of methane to benzene and hydrogen. Specifically, the project focuses on ZSM-5-supported molybdenum (Mo) catalysts.  Previous work by the investigators has revealed that the specific processes by which a ZSM-5-supported Mo oxide precursor is activated to form Mo carbide species strongly affects the catalytic behavior.  Thus, Mo-C-support interactions play a pivotal role in achieving the stable formation of aromatics.  To further investigate those interactions, model catalysts, with active metals existing only on either the outer surface or within the zeolite channels, will be prepared and evaluated by a suite of experimental and computational tools.  The structure, location, and evolution of the Mo species will be monitored by in situ and operando experiments using advanced characterization techniques, including X-ray absorption and high-resolution powder diffraction.  The experimental data will be combined with density functional theory calculations to advance knowledge with respect to the structure-activity relationship of the catalysts and the reaction pathways involved in the complete MDA catalytic cycle (activation, reaction, deactivation, regeneration).  The combination of kinetic tests, in situ structural characterization, and theoretical calculations will result in the determination of the reaction and deactivation pathways of MDA and will provide the basis for the rational design of catalysts. Beyond the research efforts, the investigators will develop a novel virtual reality (VR) technology module that will allow K-12 students to immerse themselves into a catalyst structure and allow them to directly interact with dynamic 3-D images of the molecules involved in a catalytic process.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The focus will be to assess how a range of disruptions, from routine challenges to large-scale disasters, alter public interactions with these systems. Study data will include interviews with subject matter experts from water utilities and public health agencies. It will also include a national survey to understand how well these US infrastructures can adapt to future challenges.

Policies and regulations governing data privacy play a critical role in communicating privacy expectations to users and defining the bounds of permissible data use. However, in practice, there are severe mismatches between user expectations and the actual practices of software companies, even when those practices conform with their privacy policies. This project's goal is to enable automated reasoning over privacy policies and regulations that can assist users, policy developers, and regulators in understanding unintended consequences of data practices and policies.<br/><br/>Past research on automated reasoning for privacy has led to efforts to formally model the logical semantics of regulations and support mechanized correctness proofs. The desire for transparency to users, on the other hand, has led to proposals for policy annotation schemes that support clearer presentation through natural language and visualization. This project aims to unify these goals by developing techniques to represent policies and regulations that are both formal and explorable, answering 'what if'? questions about specific scenarios in addition to providing provable guarantees.  The project requires technical advances in formal methods, narrative generation, natural language processing, and human-computer interaction. The research team will formalize privacy regulations such as the European Union's General Data Privacy Regulation, as well as privacy policies specific to software companies and service providers, using a relational programming model known as Answer Set Programming (ASP). The research team plans to discover new techniques for interoperating with ASP as a lightweight semantic modeling framework, with support for answering queries, generating scenarios that reveal privacy loopholes, generating counterexamples to global correctness conditions, suggesting repairs for broken policies, and enabling the exploration of hypothetical scenarios by policy developers and users.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Dramatic turns of events are key to recognizing and communicating effective reports or stories about events.  Autonomous systems will work more effectively with humans in obtaining and conveying such narrative when they too can recognize what is dramatic (or tragic, or comical) about human events.  The challenge is to effectively convey such concepts to a computer in such a way that humans and autonomous systems can effectively work together in this. This research studies how to direct a team of robots to obtain video footage to produce clips that trace a dramatic story arc. It is an examination of how such systems might achieve goals that people consider to be abstract or high-level. Within this project, the programs that command teams of robots must predict likely events, direct the robots to be in position for obtaining the desired footage, and re-plan based on observed events. This challenge encompasses a rich and previously unstudied class of problems for robot systems.  It will constitute a unique demonstration of robots that are capable of achieving high-level goals as they process data in forms which combine both continuous and discrete views of the world in a new and unusual way.

Urbanization affects climate, the amount of water in soil (soil moisture), and the type and amount of vegetation across the landscape. All of these factors strongly impact evapotranspiration (ET): the flux of water from land to the atmosphere. Urban ET is poorly predicted by hydrologic models that do not adequately represent human actions, such as irrigation. Yet, urban irrigation can have large effects on climate, soil moisture, and plant growth and survival. This study addresses the extent to which ET is limited by soil moisture, atmospheric water demand (a function of humidity and air temperature), or the density and distribution of vegetation within and across U.S. cities. Measurements will be made in three urban regions: Los Angeles, CA (a semi-arid city where irrigation has been declining due to drought response policy), Salt Lake City, UT (semi-arid but still heavily irrigated), and Tallahassee, FL (high rainfall and very high urban tree cover). These cities represent urban settings with different water cycle components. This project will advance knowledge and understanding of urban ET, improve basic climate and water cycle models, and to contribute to efficient water management in cities and urban landscapes.   <br/><br/>Urban hydrologic data are still sparse relative to observations in natural and agricultural systems. To advance a generalizable understanding of urban hydrology, it is necessary to explore categorizable differences within and across cities in the balance of water supply (soil moisture as supplied by both irrigation and precipitation), plant demand for water uptake (as determined by the magnitude, distribution, and composition of leaf area), and atmospheric evaporative demand (net radiation and vapor pressure deficit). The project will examine similarities and differences in these fluxes within and across cities by quantifying irrigation efficiency, its variability, and its key drivers. The contribution of each component of the soil-plant-atmosphere system to ET fluxes is likely to vary in mesic vs. arid/semi-arid climates and according to local irrigation practices as well as urbanization processes that influence land and vegetative cover. By sampling cities that are hypothesized to span different combinations and ranges of irrigation practices and likely limits on urban soil moisture, vapor pressure deficit, and ET, the investigators will test a general framework that can be applied beyond these specific cities and measurement sites. Ultimately, this project will use the extensive datasets collected in this study for advancing mechanistic models of urban landscape ET as an alternative to empirical crop and landscape coefficient approaches. The results will be disseminated to stakeholders and extension specialists who are focused on improving turfgrass management, outdoor water management, and urban water policy. The investigators will also leverage programs for recruiting and retaining undergraduate and graduate students from under-represented groups to build a diverse, interdisciplinary team aimed at broadening participation in STEM.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The outcomes of this project result in six main components that include: (i) characterizing the dynamics of dual fuel NG engines in advanced combustion regimes, (ii) building the first physics-based control-oriented model for advanced dual fuel NG engines, (iii) developing new analytical tools for deriving models through the powerful fusion of machine learning and classical multivariate methods, (iv) providing solutions to fill the gaps between first-principles models and data-driven methods for estimating an accurate model, (v) bridging the gaps between parameter-varying systems and stochastic controls, and (vi) constructing, testing, and validating the combustion controllers for dual fuel NG engines. The outcomes from these six theoretical, modeling and experimental contributions will be generic dynamic modeling and predictive control design tools for nonlinear and stochastic industrial systems that are demonstrated on engine test-beds.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

These concerns arise because smart home devices can collect potentially sensitive data about their users and the data and devices can be accessed (e.g., to unlock doors or disable home security systems) in the absence of physical human actions. Further, the risks posed by smart-home devices can impact people other than the device owners, such as home service workers and children. There is a need for a systematic understanding of the security and privacy impact of such platforms. However, existing work is often too coarse-grained to capture the context in which these devices are used (e.g., camera in public area vs. in the bedroom) and mostly focuses on risks and harms to device owners rather than more broadly. This project aims to gain a deeper understanding of smart homes' security and privacy impact, with a focus on end-user programming platforms like IFTTT and Zapier, and to mitigate potential harms via formal modeling and automated analysis tools.  One of the identifying characteristics of this project is that user studies are used to both identify user needs and to evaluate potential solutions, including models and formal analysis tools.<br/><br/>This project follows an iterative process, where tools and models are first built (based on results of preliminary user studies); next, user studies are conducted to evaluate the tools and learn about users' needs; then, results from user studies are used to refine the tools and models. This project builds detailed, context-rich models and characterizations of risks and harms from home automation platforms, customized to individual users' perspective, and thus fills the gap between what existing models and tools can do and users' perceptions and needs. This project also builds usable, context-aware, configurable analysis tools that extend traditional information-flow analysis to calculate attackers? precise knowledge of and influence over the system. These analysis tools take into consideration different threat models, which account for attackers? different capabilities to observe relevant events and interact with the system. Finally, the project designs warnings and nudges to help users understand their smart home systems better and avoid potential harm.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Microphysiological systems (MPS), also known as tissue chips, are an alternative to animal models that enable the study of complex tissue systems. MPS can incorporate patient specific stem cells for personalized medicine and are easily scalable for larger scale investigations. This project will support the development of a new MPS that controls physical, biochemical, and cell signaling cues to guide the development of microvascular tissues, including the cues needed for forming perfusable blood vessels. It is expected that successful completion of this work will provide a greater understanding of how physical, biochemical, and cell signaling cues guide microvessel development and establish an alternative to animal models for pre-clinical drug testing. This work will support the training of junior scientists from diverse backgrounds and prepare them for careers in research and education. The Investigators are proactive in working to increase diversity and expose high school students to possible STEM career opportunities. Further, findings that are made from this research will be shared through numerous outreach activities and programs including: Teach the Teachers, undergraduate and high school student mentorship, and speaking at public engagements such as the Annual Benoit Laboratory Alex?s Lemonade Stand.<br/><br/>Advances in tissue engineering and tissue chip technology have catalyzed the rise of microphysiological systems (MPS) as an alternative to animal models for preclinical testing.  MPS for vascularized tissues either forego perfused microvasculature or rely on oversimplified endothelial cell-lined fluidic channels. Microvascular tissues are 3D and have tissue specific molecular transport, angioarchitectural, and paracrine-tissue crosstalk properties. Engineered extracellular matrices (eECM) comprised of poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) hydrogels crosslinked with matrix metalloproteinase (MMP)-degradable peptides and functionalized with cell adhesive ligands have been shown to support vasculogenesis. In this project, vasculogenic eECM will be introduced into a novel MPS designed for microvascular network development. Specifically, pressure/flow and eECM biophysical and biochemical cues will be explored to guide the development of in vivo-like perfusable microvasculature specific to bone, salivary gland, and the retina. Successful completion of the proposed aims will elucidate the role of flow in microvascular development, advance the development of MPSs, and augment our understanding of the eECM biochemical cues that mediate endothelial cell vasculogenesis.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

To construct these programs, software developers must divide each problem into smaller operations and order those operations carefully to compute the correct answer. This ordering can be viewed as a network graph, where each operation points to its next possible operations in order. Furthermore, to make these programs run fast enough to be useful, developers, engineers, and researchers must find new ways to balance those operations with system resources such as storage, processing units, and memory. These resource constraints add more ordering requirements to the graph. Verifying this graph can help avoid bugs. Information inferred from this graph can be used to automatically decrease the time the program requires to run. Thus, people working in computing frequently examine these graphs to generate or validate new ideas about how to write their programs or use computational resources. For example, a programmer may discover a long sequence of operations performed one after another that could be parallelized, thus making the program faster. General approaches for drawing networks have not met the demand of graphs in the computing space, resulting in difficult to interpret, if not unusable, diagrams. The purpose of this project is to develop new graph visualization approaches to better support developers, engineers, and researchers in their work and learners in their understanding of computing and their integration of tools such as graph visualization into their skill sets.<br/><br/>Graphs arising from computing contexts frequently take the form of directed acyclic or near-acyclic graphs (DAG-like graphs). The aim of this project is to develop layout algorithms and design guidelines specifically for this class of computing graphs. Research tasks include surveying graphs generated across computing disciplines to derive a characterization of their structure, their domain-specific sub-structures, and their common drawing conventions. The characterization will guide the development of constraints and objectives for layout of node-link diagrams as well as design guidelines for interactivity and visual encoding in support of domain-specific tasks.

This is particularly challenging at the ice-ocean boundary where there are multiple processes occurring simultaneously. At present, no single equation adequately describes the changing ice-ocean boundary, which poses problems for coupling ice sheet models to climate models. This project will improve understanding of how the variables that influence the ice-ocean boundary may change over time and space using machine learning to search for relationships amidst available data. This technique will allow the research team to categorize glacier terminus behavior and identify the relevant parameters forcing change for a particular glacier around the Greenland Ice Sheet. Results of the machine learning exercise will be used to develop an equation to represent ice-ocean interactions in an ice sheet model which will be used to determine future changes to the ice sheet forced by the ocean into the future. <br/> <br/>Models of future ice sheet change yield reliable forecasts of sea level rise only when all the critical processes controlling ice sheet evolution are appropriately accounted for. However, many physical processes are currently poorly understood. One such process is ablation (iceberg calving and submarine melt) at the terminus of outlet glaciers, which has been shown to be the dominant control on mass change at particular glaciers. The goal of this project is to improve model forecasts of sea-level from Greenland by using machine learning analyses of glaciological observations to inform physics-based modeling of outlet glaciers, with a focus on the ice-ocean boundary. Machine learning tools will be used to determine what controls changes in terminus position over a range of time scales for all glaciers in Greenland over a period of pronounced historical change (the satellite era). Analysis of the model performance will enable the research team to determine the dominant controls on terminus position for individual and groups of glaciers and to test how well the model performs as new glaciological and environmental data become available. The machine learning model of terminus positions will be used to improve projections of outlet glacier mass change using a physically-based numerical ice flow model. The team will examine how robust model prediction is on various time-scales as more and more data become available over the course of this project. The project will result in refined projections of dynamic loss from the Greenland Ice Sheet, which is important for policy makers needing to make critical infrastructure and resource decisions globally. This goal is a central focus for research within NSF's Office of Polar Programs, NSF's Navigating the New Arctic, and other national (e.g., NASA, NOAA) and international priorities.

It empowers investigators to design and build from the ground up useful new biological systems such as metabolic pathways. SynBio can also uncover the deep operating principles that underlie biological systems ? the ?Rules of Life?. This is done by applying the build-to-learn philosophy, i.e. (i) design and construct biosystems based on current knowledge of the Rules; (ii) if the systems don?t perform as predicted, diagnose why and thus deepen knowledge of the Rules. Despite its intellectual power and practical potential in metabolic engineering, SynBio has been slow to reach plant biology and SynBio training has historically been concentrated in engineering schools where women and other groups are notably underrepresented. There is consequently an urgent need to bring SynBio into mainstream plant metabolism research and diversified training, and to use SynBio?s build-to-learn philosophy to define Rules for redesigning plant metabolism. This project will accordingly harness the complementary SynBio strengths of three leading plant science universities to design a tri-campus PhD training and research program to define Rules to guide engineering of novel metabolic pathways. The project will be designed in virtual workshops, one hosted by each campus. Design goals will be to (i) integrate basic engineering skills and internships in SynBio companies into PhD training, leading to an interuniversity graduate research certificate, and (ii) develop strategies to recruit women to redress the gender imbalance in engineering. The workshops will also help plan a major 2021 Plant SynBio Conference, which Co-PI Lenaghan will chair.           <br/><br/><br/>Synthetic biology (SynBio) has the power to change biology from a descriptive to a prescriptive discipline and to transform plant improvement, particularly of metabolic traits. However, perhaps because its roots are in chemical engineering, the SynBio revolution has barely reached plant science yet. To address the critical shortage of SynBio PhD training for plant scientists, and the underrepresentation of women in the field, plant scientists and metabolic engineers at three major plant science universities (University of Florida, University of Tennessee, and Purdue University) have come together in this project to pool their complementary expertise to design a coordinated three-campus PhD training and research program in SynBio. The project will hold three virtual workshops (one hosted by each university) to plan a graduate certificate in SynBio and a concerted research plan to define Rules of Life that (i) predict how well enzymes and metabolic pathways developed in microbial SynBio platforms will transfer to plants, and (ii) enable the amount, stoichiometry, and timing of enzyme activity to be adjusted to assure efficient operation of new multienzyme pathways in plants. In the certificate program, online flipped-classroom courses will be given in their areas of expertise by each university and SynBio companies will be recruited to host internships for students. Courses will cover basic coding, engineering principles, metabolic engineering, synthetic regulatory circuits, and directed evolution. The workshops will also plan strategies to recruit women.

Humankind is now on the verge of a second quantum revolution fueled by quantum information science (QIS), which is envisioned to enable disruptive communication, sensing, and computing applications. Despite the tremendous prospects promised by QIS, building large-scale and robust quantum information processing systems remains an outstanding challenge due to the fragility of quantum information in the present noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) hardware. To unlock the power of NISQ devices and systems, hybrid quantum-classical protocols have become a focus of recent QIS studies, in which state-of-the-art classical data science tools are leveraged to steer NISQ hardware towards solving specific data-processing problems. This CAREER project will develop a new photonic quantum machine-learning architecture that combines mature, classical machine-learning tools and NISQ platforms to endow unprecedented communication, sensing, and data processing capabilities. Compared with other NISQ platforms, quantum photonics feature room-temperature operations, mass productivity, and compatibility with the existing telecommunication and sensing infrastructures. The project will advance basic knowledge for the NISQ era and the interdisciplinary areas of QIS, machine learning, and NSF?s 10 Big Ideas Harnessing the Data Revolution and the Quantum Leap. A critical ingredient for a sustainable QIS ecosystem is to develop the next-generation quantum workforce. To this end, this CAREER project will encompass activities for: 1) QIS teaching laboratories for undergraduate students; 2) a QIS training program for industry workforce development; and 3) outreach to engage K-12 STEM students early in QIS.<br/><br/>The research activities of this CAREER project will encompass both: 1) a photonic quantum machine-learning architecture based on a classical machine-learning framework and photonic quantum information-processing hardware, including reconfigurable entanglement sources and adaptive quantum receivers; and 2) photonic quantum machine-learning applications for long-haul optical communications, multi-domain sensing, and quantum-enhanced data processing. The new photonic quantum machine-learning architecture will effectively use cutting-edge classical machine-learning tools to configure variational photonic quantum circuits, as a powerful means to generate, process, and measure quantum information. Although photons interact only weakly with each other to hinder the use of large-scale photonic entanglement, the proposed photonic quantum machine-learning architecture will overcome this barrier by leveraging quantum photonics that offer deterministic generation, the processing of large-scale entanglement, and suitability for sensing and communication applications. By combining enhancements from machine learning and quantum coherence, the expected project outcomes will enhance various sensing- and communication-related tasks, including pattern recognition, deep-space signal detection, and efficient data compression. Ultimately, broadly sharing the new knowledge grown out of these research activities should spark collaborations between academia, National Laboratories, and the U.S. healthcare, aerospace, environmental protection, and chemical engineering industries. By working with industrial partners, the CAREER project will connect with new quantum technologies that transform U.S. industries. The project research facilities and workforce development activities will help to prepare the U.S. technology industry workforce for the future quantum edge and establish comfortable and personally relevant quantum foundations for students across university to high-school settings.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Wind-induced damage to roof components of low-rise buildings is predominantly attributed to extreme suction loads caused by vortices that develop when the oncoming wind flow impinges on the structure, resulting in flow detachment near roof corners and edges. Previous research has demonstrated the effectiveness of several wind mitigation strategies for alleviating uplift roof pressures under a limited number of idealized wind tunnel flow conditions. This research will leverage a novel flow-control instrument at the University of Florida Natural Hazards Engineering Research Infrastructure (NHERI) Experimental Facility to physically simulate a wide range of atmospheric flows in a large boundary layer wind tunnel. The project will integrate machine learning and computational modeling to predict extreme wind loading for unexplored wind tunnel configurations and fill critical knowledge gaps associated with the complex relation between atmospheric turbulence and aerodynamic loading. The large volumes of velocity and pressure data will be made available in the NHERI Data Depot (https://www.DesignSafe-ci.org). The research will address fundamental fluid-structure interaction questions while enhancing the performance of roof systems, and ultimately contribute to increasing wind hazard resilience of low-rise buildings.

Significant technological challenges need to be resolved before long-distance trucking can work safely without substantial human oversight. This research team effort is motivated by a shared belief that remote operation of trucks is a necessary step in the automation journey and will lead to positive technological, economic, environmental, and societal outcomes. As-needed remote operation could fundamentally transform trucking into something closer to a white-collar job, requiring human-computer interaction, in a controlled and scheduled environment. It would eschew long hours by drivers on the road, far from home, and likely change the skills and characteristics of the job in ways that will have gender/racial equity, health, and socio-economic implications. What technological problems must be solved for a truck to safely operate almost entirely autonomously, with a remote operator intervening on request or as warranted when the autonomy stack is challenged? How will the nature of the trucking occupation change, and what does it portend for current and future workers? We propose an integrated effort that innovates on remote operation technology and identifies concomitant changes in policies, regulations, and skills (including (re)training requirements) to positively affect the number and quality of jobs and improve outcomes for all stakeholders. This research will be informed by key stakeholders: drivers, independent owner-operators, shipping firms, regulators, vehicle manufacturers, and automation developers. <br/><br/>In the Future technology context, this project will: (i) develop a data-driven and simulation-informed system that can continuously monitor and predict challenging traffic conditions, (ii) develop a robust safety filter that mediates the commands issued by the local autonomy stack and the remote human operator, (iii) establish a cooperative architecture and algorithms for automated trucking, and (iv) identify network solutions to meet the communication needs of remote operation. In the Future work component, this project will: (i) investigate information requirements of remote operators and techniques to balance automated in-vehicle control with remote control by an operator, (ii) explore managing operators? attention and level of control across multiple trucks, and (iii) address critical regulatory issues and how to balance operator compensation, firm profitability, and technology adoption. In the Future worker category, this project will: (i) evaluate expected changes in the distribution of occupations and skill requirements in the workforce, (ii) assess the impact of job creation and loss on rural economies, and (iii) elucidate the skill and demand changes for truckers and the new training needed for these workers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

While the federal government has traditionally funded basic research, the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the largest federal funder of academic biomedical research, has increasingly emphasized translational research. Industry funding of academic research, while remaining at steady levels, often comes with secrecy requirements that have the potential to impede broad technological advances. Further, both federal and industry funders have become more risk averse in their investments, exacerbating a funding gap between invention and commercialization. In response, philanthropic funding--donations and investments made by nonprofit organizations such as private foundations--is increasing. Philanthropic funders are experimenting with new models to catalyze collaborations across players at different points in the drug development process. This project assesses how these different funders and their varying strategies spur biomedical innovation so that future investments can be optimized for society's benefit. In addition, this project examines how a funder's strategy impacts the type of research conducted between basic, translational, and applied, as well as how it affects a scientist's career path. <br/><br/>The funding landscape of biomedical research is changing with federal funding in flux, industry funding growing more risk-averse, and nonprofit funding on the rise but employing different terms of sponsored research agreements. To better understand the differences in how these funding strategies are implemented and their subsequent impact on innovation, this project builds an extensive scientist-level database of biomedical projects and outcomes. The database uses university administrative records to merge together individual data with sponsored-research proposals and awards, as well as scientific outcomes. Outcomes include peer-reviewed publication activity and technology transfer data on inventions, disclosures, and spin-out firms. Using econometric analysis, these data are used to assess how different funder's strategies impact biomedical innovation, the pipeline of science studied by academics, and the impacts of these choices on the scientists' careers.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

The data structures created in this project will allow computational biology and big data applications to maintain compact summaries of huge data sets.  Because the summaries are small, they can be stored in a computer's fast memory, enabling applications to run much more quickly and to scale to larger data sets.  For example, this project will develop a tool for searching through genetic information for thousands (to millions) of individuals to detect genetic variations that are correlated with disease or other traits.  <br/><br/>A major challenge that this project will address is that applications need compact, feature-rich summary data structures.  Applications need summaries that can represent a set of elements, count duplicates in a set of input data, be resized as the data set grows, support deletions of items, be merged with other summaries, and support high concurrency on today's multi-core systems.  However, current summary data structures offer limited features.  As a result, today's applications must design around these limitations, resulting in software that is slower, uses more memory, and is more complex than necessary.<br/><br/>The project will impact core computer science applications, such as databases and file systems, and medical and biological applications, such as genome and transcriptome analysis.  Databases and file systems will run faster and use less memory.  They will be able to combine fast, expensive solid-state storage devices with cheap, slow, but capacious hard drives to get the best of both devices: low cost and high performance.  Biologists will be able to analyze sequencing data more quickly and cheaply, using fewer computational resources.  They will be able to search through huge datasets to make new discoveries.<br/><br/>All papers, documentation, and software created by this project will be released as open source, typically on popular open-source development websites, such as GitHub, under the COMBINE-lab (https://github.com/COMBINE-lab) and splatlab (https://github.com/splatlab) organizations.  Papers will be hosted by the publishers, as well as on the author?s personal websites.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."

Indeed, in 2018, McAfee estimated that the global economic damages caused by cybercrime was 600 billion USD, with as many as 2/3rds of all Internet users having been affected by personal data breaches. Moreover, many of these breaches were the result of human error. Prior work in usable privacy and security has identified three barriers that help explain why pro-S&P behaviors remain rare: awareness, motivation and ability. The overarching hypothesis  of  this  proposal  is  that  it should  be  possible  to  address  these  barriers  to  pro-S&P  behaviors  by creating  corporeal security and privacy interfaces (CSPIs)  that allow  people  to  take  advantage  of  their  corporeal  threat  perception  (e.g., intuitively understanding that walking in a dimly lit area is less safe than walking in a well-lit area) and their natural understanding of the physics-based affordances of the physical world (e.g., whispering to reduce the range of who can hear one?s voice) in digital S&P-relevant contexts. To test this hypothesis, this project proposes to design, implement and evaluate three novel CSPIs.  First, Bit Whisperer is a wireless communication protocol that situates digital communications on physical surfaces to raise people?s awareness of the audience of and threats to their wireless communications.  Second, Spidey Sense is a smartwatch wristband that delivers affective haptic feedback to motivate heightened responses to S&P warnings.  Third, Horcrux is a tangible smart mat that improves people?s ability to collaboratively author access control policies for collectively owned and shared digital resources. This research, if successful, could significantly improve the widespread adoption of pro-S&P behaviors and, in turn, mitigate vulnerabilities that result from human error.<br/><br/>This proposal marries ideas from tangible, wearable, and haptic computing with challenges in end-user cybersecurity and privacy. The proposed work will encompass some of the first attempts to integrate state-of-the-art tangible interaction techniques designed to address the awareness, ability and motivation barriers to pro-S&P behaviors, by asking research questions such as: (a) How might situated digital communications improve people?s awareness of the range of their wireless communications and the threats thereof? (b) How might affective haptics improve end-users? motivation to respond to S&P warnings? (c) How might tangible user interfaces improve the ability of social groups to collaboratively author access control policies for shared accounts and resources? In exploring these questions, the research will make the following high-level intellectual contributions: (i) the iterative design and implementation of three CSPIs---Bit Whisperer, Spidey Sense and Horcrux; (ii) rigorous empirical studies in which we will explore the effectiveness of these CSPIs in addressing the awareness, motivation and ability barriers to pro-S&P behaviors; and (iii) a synthesized set of design opportunities and challenges for CSPIs in the context of usable S&P. The outputs of this project will serve as a foundation for a new cross-disciplinary collaboration between scholars in the HCI, S&P and Tangible Computing communities.<br/><br/>This award reflects NSF's statutory mission and has been deemed worthy of support through evaluation using the Foundation's intellectual merit and broader impacts review criteria."
