All stars are born in large clouds of gas in galaxies, which condense to form stars and planets.  The investigator will write new computer models for the physics that determines the mass of new stars. She will also study how neighboring young stars influence each other and their birth environment by injecting energy into their surroundings. Evidence suggests our Sun formed together with thousands of siblings, which may have shaped our Sun?s properties.  However, why stars like our Sun have the masses they do remains debated. Her team will model how stars interact with their birth environment and test different theories for the origin of star masses.  The investigator will produce synthetic observations of the models and compare these to telescope observations of star-forming regions in our Milky Way galaxy.  The educational goal of the project is to increase participation and diversity in STEM.  The investigator will use the World Wide Telescope (WWT) educational software to communicate recent exciting astronomy discoveries to the public.  She will use WWT to create interactive labs for several local underserved populations, will also organize research training and organize an annual star formation symposia.<br/><br/>The proposal aims to explore two fundamental questions in star formation: How do stars obtain their masses? What sets the star formation rate in molecular clouds? The PI will address these questions by performing multi-physics numerical simulations of forming star clusters including outflow, wind and radiation feedback.  The three key science objectives are to 1) constrain the importance of core masses in setting the stellar initial mass function, 2) evaluate the influence of feedback on turbulence and star formation efficiency, and 3) bridge simulations and observations using ""apples-to-apples"" comparisons.  The investigator will produce synthetic observations of the models and compare directly to observations, harnessing thousands of hours of current and planned large- scale surveys probing dense gas, proto-stellar outflows with very fine resolution."

Despite their long study, many questions about the distribution of prime numbers remain unsolved. Primes are also intertwined with the study of class numbers, which appear in many number-theoretic settings. Class numbers have been studied for 200 years, but still remain largely mysterious, although precise conjectures have been developed. Seemingly far away on the mathematical spectrum,  Radon transforms quantify the distribution of the ""mass"" of functions along lower-dimensional surfaces; they are a critical part of the theory underlying Computed Tomography medical imaging. The study of Radon transforms is a central area in harmonic analysis with far-reaching connections both to the Carleson operator, which was instrumental in answering a historic question on Fourier series, and to the new world of discrete arithmetic operators, which blends harmonic analysis with number theory. This project, which is at the intersection of number theory and harmonic analysis, explores and connects all of these themes. During the course of the work, the project will contribute to the mathematical community through training postdocs, a graduate summer school, and mathematical outreach activities for children.<br/><br/>The major aims of this research center on five projects at the intersection of number theory and harmonic analysis. First, new bounds relating to the divisibility of class numbers of number fields of arbitrary degree will be obtained. Second, new bounds will be obtained for short character sums, which historically provided an important subconvexity result for L-functions, and now in a multi-dimensional setting have the potential to impact problems involving counting integral solutions to Diophantine equations. Third, in the realm of Diophantine equations, new variations on the circle method, and closely related questions on multi-dimensional oscillatory integrals, will be developed. Fourth, new results for discrete operators will be proved by adapting number-theoretic methods to the setting of harmonic analysis. Finally, a systematic investigation of Carleson operators with polynomial phases and Radon-type behavior will be carried out."

If the agents make their decisions dynamically, in an uncertain environment, the outcome of such interactions can be conveniently described by a continuum-player stochastic dynamic game.  The investigator pursues several research directions, unified by the idea of establishing the game-theoretic models, which on the one hand capture the real-world phenomena with sufficient precision, and on the other hand allow for tractable representations of the equilibria.  Such models can be used to establish quantitative results, i.e., to make predictions about the future evolution of a system, or to optimize the rules of interaction in the system.  The study of such classes of games is motivated by various applications.  As particular cases, the investigator considers models arising in market microstructure and systemic risk.  The results of the project can be used for predicting the potential instabilities in financial markets and for designing effective regulatory policies for financial exchanges and banking systems.  In addition, the class of systems analyzed in this project includes other relevant models in economics, neuroscience, and sociology, resulting in a large array of potential applications that may benefit society.  The educational component of the project includes designing teaching materials, for both undergraduate and graduate students, with stronger emphasis on the novel applications of mathematics to problems of finance and economics.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project.<br/><br/>     While there are many abstract mathematical results for constructing equilibria in dynamic stochastic games, these results rely on assumptions that often are incompatible with realistic models.  The investigator considers several classes of large-population games that naturally fail to satisfy the standard assumptions, either due to the presence of stopping times in the agents' strategies, or because of the singular type of interactions between the agents.  In both cases, the standard fixed-point results cannot be applied directly to construct an equilibrium, due to the lack of required continuity or monotonicity properties.  The investigator studies several methods to overcome these difficulties, which lead to mathematical problems interesting in their own right.  This study contributes to the theory of continuum-player games (including, but not limited to, mean field games), optimal stochastic control, and the propagation of chaos.  In particular, this project addresses specific problems in the theory of backward stochastic differential equations with oblique reflection, as well as the questions of limiting behavior of particle systems with singular interaction through hitting times.  The results of this analysis provide new tools for equilibrium-based modeling.  Graduate students are included in the work of the project."

Getting both the accuracy and aesthetics of color choices right, however, is hard, and most existing tools for helping designers focus on just one of the two.  Developing accurate color mappings is even harder because how colors are perceived changes depending on the size and shape of visual marks, lighting and contrast, and a number of other factors.  In this project, the research team will use designs created by existing tools to construct an initial statistical model of color mappings that captures expert designers' current decision-making.  They will then improve those models by creating visualizations based on the models, altering size, shape, contrast, and lighting, and testing how well people can use those designs to learn the underlying values of the data.  Finally, the team will create a design tool that allows both expert and non-expert designers to create visualizations, choosing anchor colors and aspects of the visualization, and generating color maps that are most accurate and aesthetic based on the models and the designer's choices.  The work will lead to more accurate models of perception and mechanisms for choosing color maps that capture both design expertise and perceptual accuracy; this, in turn, will lead to practical improvements in the effectiveness of data visualizations that are increasingly part of people's experience.  The team also plans to increase the accessibility of data visualizations by helping designers choose color mappings that are more usable by people with color-blindness, while making the tools themselves more usable by color-blind people.  The tools and work will also be integrated into several courses on human-computer interaction and data science at the lead investigator's institution, benefiting students from a variety of research groups and departments.<br/><br/>Color ramps will be represented as a set of control points (two end points in sequential encodings and two end points plus a midpoint in diverging ramps) that determine the overall structure of the ramp, and a smooth interpolation path that connecting the control points in colorspace.  To capture current expert practice, the team will first extract initial color ramps from colormaps available in existing design-based visualization tools, using the CIELAB colorspace to model the statistical characteristics of the control points and interpolation paths of these encodings, generating aesthetic constraints grounded in the current design consensus.  The team will then use crowdsourcing platforms, which have been shown to be effective for a number of perceptual and visualization experiments, to systematically study how specific aspects of visualization design including mark shape, mark size, and visualization type, affect people's ability to detect color differences in colorspace; further, conducting the experiment online means this model will be specifically tailored to the online/web/screen viewing context.  This empirical model can enforce perceptual constraints imposed by visualization design choices on the color ramps generated by the aesthetic models by constraining and repositioning control points.  Finally, these models will be integrated into a publicly available color authoring system that will be validated through use in courses at the lead researcher's institution and at design workshops with the local community.  In addition to developing the specific models and tools around color encodings, the work sets up a broader research agenda of combining automation and interaction, in which semi-automated guidance democratizes effective visualization practice and allows people to leverage prior designs and create new representations without requiring extensive visualization training."

For example, an infinite sequence of numbers might be compactly encoded as the values of a simple function. One such occurrence relevant to this project is the set of dimensions of a sequence of spaces. In many cases of interest, it may not be possible to directly compute these numbers, but one can instead analyze their rate of growth. An old theme in mathematics has been to understand such problems by finding some algebraic structure on the sequence. Recently, several groups of researchers have found new, exotic algebraic structures that apply to previously unexpected examples of such sequences in areas such as topology, combinatorics, and algebraic geometry. The time is right for a deeper study of these structures. This project will develop such a study through targeted applications to new classes of examples which have been selected for novelty, either in settings or technical details.<br/><br/>The PI will pursue several projects that involve different kinds of categorical and classical symmetries in commutative algebra and algebraic geometry. The general theme of the research is to find and exploit hidden symmetries in a problem to gain new information about it. This information can take the form of a new structural property or a finiteness result about a family of invariants. This research will focus in particular on several classes of mathematical objects for which these properties or calculation of invariants have resisted more traditional means of attack. Among these are: the action of ordered injections on the homology of groups of upper-triangular matrices, the action of surjections on the cohomology of compactified moduli spaces, and Hopf ring actions on syzygies of secant varieties of varieties arising from multilinear algebra. These are three examples of variants of the recently well-studied ""FI-modules,"" which offer new technical challenges and open the door to new paradigms of ""representation stability."""

The idea is that large groups can increase the diversity of information available and lead to better outcomes.  This may not be true; research shows that in small groups, people often fail to share relevant knowledge and tend to overlook minority points of view.  This proposal's goal is to examine how these research findings about small groups transfer to larger, online ""crowds"", which typically have more members and different contribution patterns than small groups working more closely together; further, participating in a crowd platform is typically voluntary and thus their membership can change quickly during the discussion.  To understand how these differences affect information sharing behavior, the research team will first modify the well-known hidden profile task that is used to study small groups' information sharing to fit crowd contexts.  The team will then run a series of studies that vary the size, participation requirements, task duration, and composition of the crowd, and measure how both the sharing of information and the quality of the crowd's responses change as the design of the task changes.  This will lead to both a deeper understanding of information sharing behaviors in groups, and design guidelines for building crowd platforms that are better for problem solving.  The work will also provide training opportunities for both PhD and undergraduate researchers, materials to use in teaching courses around social computing, and software that will be shared with other researchers who want to study online crowds. <br/><br/>The work will be based on classic hidden profile tasks where information is unequally distributed among group members.  Because group sizes are generally small because of practicalities of recruitment, in typical hidden profile designs a piece of information is either known to a majority of the group, or to one unique member.  For crowd contexts, the team will introduce a third category of rare clues that are neither unique nor majority, since this is likely to be a common phenomenon in large groups; the relative proportion of shared, rare, and unique clues can be adjusted to set the difficulty of a particular case.  The team plans to conduct four sets of experiments using a real online crowd platform, allowing them to recruit large groups subject to the actual incentives of crowd participation.  Each set of experiments will manipulate one major difference identified between crowds and smaller groups that theory suggests might affect the crowd's information sharing behavior: group size, the ability to choose a preferred task, the length of the discussion (minutes versus days), and the amount of turnover in the crowd.  Doing this will lead to a richer theoretical picture of how large groups perform information sharing, discussion, and analysis tasks, as well as generate practical guidelines for the design of both specific crowd tasks and crowd platforms more generally."

A major challenge in this area is that the fundamental notion of ""higher infinity-category"" is schematic, and thus technical developments rely upon explicit models, each of which can be quite complicated to specify. The PI will conduct three interwoven projects that advance the model-independent foundations for higher infinity-category theory, generalizing known results from the quasi-categorical model for infinity-categories to other models while simultaneously simplifying several technical proofs, as is often the case when one employs a judiciously chosen abstraction. The PI plans to co-write a book to make the model-independent foundations of infinity-category theory accessible to novices and present the new proof techniques developed in this program. The PI has written two books already, both of which are freely available online, and has a record of innovative pedagogy and conference organization. The PI will pursue further educational initiatives, developing a new discursive introduction to mathematical proof for undergraduates, expanding her work on campus as a departmental diversity representative, and facilitating a conversation on professional norms within the mathematics community through a conference followed by an edited volume of essays.<br/><br/>The first proposed project, joint with Verity, proves that all infinity-categorical notions are ""model-independent."" Hence any theorem proven with the aid of any model of infinity-categories will apply to them all. Together with Verity, the PI has introduced the notion of an infinity-cosmos, a universe in which (higher) infinity-categories live as objects, and has shown that the theory of infinity-categories can be developed from these axioms. This work describes a ""synthetic"" approach to the theory of infinity-categories in contrast to prior ""analytic"" approaches. A second proposed project, joint with Shulman, will develop a parallel synthetic theory of infinity-categories in homotopy type theory, a new univalent foundations for mathematics that conjecturally expresses the internal logic of an infinity-topos. The third proposed project, again joint with Verity, is to generalize from infinity-categories to higher infinity-categories by investigating the various infinity-cosmoi whose objects are complicial sets, a particularly economical model of higher infinity-categories that the PI suspects will ultimately lead to a model-independent theory."

The purpose of this project is to improve the mathematical and scientific understanding of those equations via A) concrete research projects aimed at studying the long-time behavior of solutions to such equations, and B) an educational component aimed at introducing such problems to a new and diverse generation of mathematicians. The main focus is on the study of the so-called ""non-equilibrium behavior"" of nonlinear dispersive equations. Such a behavior is exhibited in many physically important phenomena, like turbulence in ocean waves or in the transmission of optical signals, to mention only a couple. While this turbulence is easy to observe and has very strong manifestations in nature, its scientific understanding is rather poor and the mathematical justification of the involved phenomena based on the model equations is rather difficult and is mostly still open. This project is aimed at rigorously proving turbulence phenomenon for certain nonlinear dispersive models.<br/><br/>The most important feature of the long-time behavior of nonlinear dispersive partial differential equations (PDE) on compact domains is out-of-equilibrium behavior or long-time instability. This means that solutions do not exhibit long-time stability near equilibriums solutions or configurations. Such questions can be addressed from a dynamical systems perspective and from a statistical physics perspective, in what is often called in the physics literature as ""wave turbulence theory"". The proposed projects address this broad problematic from both perspectives. In terms of dynamics, the aim is to construct solutions exhibiting the so-called ""energy cascade"" phenomenon, in which the energy of a dispersive system moves its concentration zone between characteristically different length scales. On the statistical physics perspective, projects aimed at justifying the fundamental equations of wave turbulence are proposed. These are effective equations for the dynamics that are derived in the physics literature from heuristic considerations, and have very important implications on the long-time behavior of dispersive PDE, provided they are rigorously justified. The project also includes an educational component aimed at raising the interest of a younger generation of researchers in those fundamental problems through workshops, seminars, REU projects, etc."

Flexible thermoelectric and electronic films have the potential to impact a broad range of applications in energy harvesting, cooling and flexible electronics. The conventional thermoelectric and electronic devices are rigid, and fabricated using complex and relative costly processes. Additive manufacturing or printing-based approaches offer low-cost and highly scalable means to assemble colloidal nanocrystals of unique properties into flexible thermoelectric and electronic devices. Nanocrystals of thermoelectric materials, because of their small size, can be formed into inks which can be printed onto flexible substrates and in useful near-final-form structures.

The interfacial chemistry and the response of the nanocrystal-based film's thermoelectric behavior under processing conditions is critical to achieving the highest performance thermoelectric materials. These nanocrystal-based processes and materials could open new application areas impacting US manufacturing and opening new application area beyond thermoelectrics. The integrated research and education program provides educational opportunities to broad range of audiences, including the development of educational kits in thermoelectrics development and institutional and outreach programs to enhance interest from K-12 students, teachers and members of underrepresented groups in STEM careers through participation in NSF REU/RET, LSAMP, e-Girls, and e-Camp, all of which are Boise State programs, to support workforce development in the manufacturing and advanced materials areas to address increasing needs in the sustainable energy and electronic technologies.<br/><br/>This research aims to achieve bulk-like charge carrier mobility and an over two-fold increase in thermoelectric figure of merit ZT compared with current state-of-the-art flexible films.

Such an approach is expected to enhance gene delivery by inhibiting the target genes with both small molecule inhibitors and inhibitor proteins.<br/><br/>A somatic cell's first line of defense against viral infection is the innate immune response (IIR) consisting of several enzymes and receptors that actively seek out pathogenic molecules within the cell.  Activation of the IIR by cytoplasmic DNA can then induces inflammation, inhibits protein translation, and even cause the host cell to self-destruct.   While all of these reactions defend the cell from viruses, they can significantly hinder gene therapy.  Indeed, most gene therapy treatments deliver therapeutic DNA to the cytoplasm, where it unintentionally activates the IIR.  The goal of this project is to improve gene therapy by addressing this problem.  We will begin by identifying the exact proteins and genes involved in the innate immune response to cytoplasmic DNA in a variety of cancer cell lines.  Gene delivery will then be enhanced by inhibiting those genes/proteins with small molecule inhibitors and/or viral inhibitor proteins.  As an alternative to inhibition of the IIR, transgene expression will be increased by using promoters that are known to be activated by the IIR.  Altogether, these experiments will simultaneously improve gene therapy and increase our understanding of the innate immune response to cytoplasmic DNA. In addition, this project will also include a series of year-round outreach activities that will directly benefit the community.  For example, the PI will organize an outreach program that enables underrepresented high school students to perform gene delivery and biochemical engineering experiments at Villanova.  The PI will also create a summer research experience program for high school teachers that allows them to perform gene therapy experiments in the PI?s lab and then share those experiences with their classes in the fall semester.  Finally, each of the experiments conducted in this project will also be recorded and used to create educational/training videos."

Classically, the symmetries of a mathematical object form a ""group"", which is a set with a binary operation such as the integers with addition. In recent decades, we have seen the emergence of quantum mathematical objects whose symmetries form a group-like structure called a ""tensor category"", which has a collection of objects with a binary fusion operation. Tensor categories are said to encode quantum symmetry: they describe topological phases of matter in physics, and they give us quantum invariants of knots and 3-dimensional surfaces.  We are currently seeing the emergence of new mathematical objects which encode ""enriched"" quantum symmetry, which describe interfaces between 3-dimensional and 2-dimensional quantum systems. At this time, we have several competing formalisms. This project aims to unify these notions and produce exotic examples through classification. The educational component of this project includes undergraduate research and Summer schools on subfactors and quantum symmetry at the Ohio State University.  The project will incorporate the principal investigators current learning materials and those developed for these programs into a book on subfactor theory.  He will also collaborate with the STEAM Factory at Ohio State University to enhance general scientific and mathematical literacy in the community.<br/><br/>This project has two main focuses: the representation and the classification of these new enriched quantum symmetries. Unitary fusion categories have objects whose dimensions are not necessarily integers, so representing unitary fusion categories requires von Neumann factors, whose modules have a notion of continuous dimension.  In this project the principal investigator will use his previous experience in the classification of small index subfactors to classify quantum symmetries enriched in small unitary ribbon categories. This will study an enriched operator algebra theory to develop an enriched subfactor theory. The principal investigator will also develop the theory of bicommutant categories, which are a higher categorical analog of von Neumann algebras originally due to Henriques. These bicommutant categories have important connections to conformal field theory, and they are expected to be an important tool in the classification of enriched quantum symmetries."

Among many advantages, high pressure permits lower temperature, lean combustion while maintaining load requirements. Many of the reaction rates and reaction pathways between fuel/oxidizer and products are uncertain at combustion temperatures and high pressure, especially for radical intermediates. These reaction rates and reaction pathways are measured using highly sensitive tools, typically at very low pressure, and are then extrapolated to high pressure. Recent theoretical predictions suggest highly energetic radical reactions can quickly pass through different pathways in low pressure conditions. Even though most combustion systems are at higher pressures, the measurements at very low pressure underpin the models of these systems, which may lead to great uncertainty in predictive models. Some of the goals of this work are to experimentally test these effects at low pressure and estimate their contribution to mechanism uncertainty at higher pressure. Another goal is to extend highly sensitive measurement techniques to high pressure. Over the course of five years, the PI will use advanced experimental and modeling tools to measure the rates and products of energetic radical reactions spanning combustion relevant temperatures and pressures. The work contributes to cleaner combustion device designs, via improved understanding of chemical reactions relevant to soot formation and high pressure pre-ignition chemistry. Information relating to the abstractions by halogens at high temperature, one aspect of the work, also contributes to fire suppression models.  Additionally, efforts in this proposal include development of a combustion themed module for high school AP Physics curricula, which also incorporates pedagogic improvements through student-directed, inquiry-based investigations. <br/><br/>In order to test the effects of energetic pathways at low pressure, reaction rates and products of radical abstractions from hydrocarbons will be measured over wide pressure ranges. Various radicals will be employed, including halogens, in order to vary the enthalpy of reaction and the heat capacity of products at similar levels of collisional stabilization. The miniature high repetition rate shock tube (HRRST), will be used in this study.  The HRRST is a tool for generating highly repeatable, highly controlled combustion conditions suitable for measurements using advanced analytical techniques. Species concentrations will be measured with a combination of tunable diode laser absorption for selected time-resolved species and mass spectrometry for products, including synchrotron sourced photoionization mass spectrometry in collaboration with researchers at Argonne National Laboratory and at the Advanced Light Source at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. Reaction rates and product channels can be ascertained from these experiments with detailed chemical modeling. Besides the radical reactions which are the focus of this study, the work develops a nascent diagnostic technique, the HRRST, which can be adopted by a variety of disciplines."

This is particularly important for second language learning, where there is a huge amount of content to learn and it is difficult for learners to stay engaged. Although researchers in education and psychology have identified guiding principles for sequencing learning materials, there is a lack of pragmatic techniques that can apply these principles to build effective learning progressions automatically. To address this gap, this project will: (1) develop techniques for estimating the difficulty of language learning content, (2) identify important characteristics of various expert-crafted progressions, and (3) experiment to find optimal progressions for individual students. These progressions will enhance the effectiveness of online interactive learning tools that are freely accessible to the public. The anticipated discovery of general principles of pacing will benefit educators and provide the foundation for maximizing engagement in adaptive learning systems.<br/><br/>The project will conduct three investigations in order to build adaptive learning progressions. First, the project will build a library of language materials that are organized by difficulty. To do this, the PI will explore procedural models of target linguistic knowledge such as grammar, identify which procedural steps are necessary for understanding specific materials, and organize these materials into skill trees. Second, the project will develop a set of control parameters that capture key aspects of pacing and sequencing. This will allow the PI to extract pacing strategies from expert-crafted progressions, and map these strategies onto other progressions. Third, the project will optimize progressions for individual learners by conducting large-scale multivariate experiments in online interactive learning tools."

Manufacturing organic photovoltaics is similar to newspaper printing and makes flexible, lightweight cells that can be incorporated into fabrics and curved surfaces. Their thin film configuration allows creative integration into building envelopes, expanding the opportunity to use solar energy for electricity generation in a wider range of infrastructure and building applications. This research project could contribute towards low-cost organic photovoltaics. A main barrier for use of this technology is that OPVs currently have lower efficiency compared to photovoltaics made with primarily inorganic materials (e.g. silicon). The research goal of this CAREER project is to control the structure of plastic solar cells in order to revolutionize sustainable energy generation. This research will use advanced computer simulations to understand how molecules used in organic photovoltaics can be arranged into nanostructures that are good at converting sunlight into electricity. By determining the molecules and conditions that robustly form favorable nanostructures, this project will improve recipes towards making solar cell systems. The project will facilitate regional benefits through a Boise State University service-learning project with the non-profit Discovery Center of Idaho, the state's only public hands-on science museum. Here, university students will develop exhibits as part of class and will engage directly with children and their families. The project will also include integrating computational education into the Boise State materials engineering curriculum.

The project team will use coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations accelerated with graphics processing units to predict experimentally relevant morphologies. Researchers will use atomistic configurations derived from the coarse morphologies to generate electronic structures from first principles calculations and to inform kinetic Monte Carlo simulations of charge mobility. Fundamental knowledge in the thermodynamics and kinetics of self-assembly of organic structures will be generated. Finally, to validate manufacturing protocols, the team will fabricate and characterize ingredients predicted to robustly assemble into high-efficiency structures in OPV solar cells in collaboration with National Renewable Energy Laboratory researchers."

This project is investigating social connection in two high-impact contexts: facilitating peer support in recovery from substance use disorders and supporting intergenerational connections to reduce elder isolation and provide one-on-one mentoring for children.

These research challenges are addressed through three research thrusts. The first two thrusts focus on the design and field deployment of social connectedness systems in two high impact community connection contexts, comparing interface effects based on validated social connectedness metrics. The third thrust calls for synthesizing the findings of these deployments and other relevant investigations in collaboration with leading social connectedness researchers to develop a replication framework for future work."

For example, understanding how the frictional properties of snake scales helps the animal move through mud, could lead to the design of smart skins and propulsive gaits for snake-like robotic systems in hazardous terrain. In particular, this project will use powerful geometric techniques to study the locomotion of systems that are currently poorly understood, like flexible and continuously deformable soft robots, or of movements in which the system makes intermittent contact with the ground. The outcomes of this research will greatly advance the design of innovative robots, especially soft robots. Broader impacts of this work will include increased penetration of geometric methods into the broader community of non-mathematicians, facilitated by accessible examples from animal locomotion, and by a textbook and accompanying visualization software.<br/><br/>When systems have joint limits (i.e., they have limbs instead of wheels or propellers), their ability to locomote depends on how effectively they can change their interaction with the environments at different points in a gait cycle. When these interactions are first-order constraints and they change smoothly with the system's shape, locomotive effectiveness can be characterized via a Lie bracket (a structure closely related to the curl of a vector field). This project seeks to extend this concept to include direction-dependent effects (e.g., friction from backwards-pointing spines or bristles), second order dynamics (e.g., elastic tails or wings in air), infinite-dimensional systems, and hybrid systems (e.g. walkers that can lift their feet from the ground. Specific systems that will be made accessible to geometric analysis by this project include, 1) systems with many shape variables, whose curvature is a high-dimensional structure; 2) hybrid systems, which have ""corners"" in their dynamic curvature; 3) ratcheting systems, whose reaction forces depend on the sign of the relative motion; 4) elastic systems, whose gait cycles partially emerge from their passive dynamics; and 5) gliding systems, whose gait effectiveness is better characterized by momentum transfer than by displacement induced."

One of the critical and practical ramifications of this standard of living is the necessity for separating raw materials that contain mixtures of chemicals into pure (or at least purer) forms to serve as feedstocks for chemical processes. As a result of the vast scale of our material and energy consumption, chemical separations are a major player in the world's primary energy budget: up to 5-10% of all energy use worldwide (or ~7.5 GJ per person every year) is devoted just to the separations of chemicals. This heavy energy burden for separation processes can be alleviated through the design of more efficient processes. For example, advanced membrane separators - based on molecular-scale resolution between small molecules - are at least 10 times more efficient than existing separation processes that rely on thermally-driven phase changes, opening the possibility of offsetting a substantial fraction of global energy use by bringing new technology to this world-scale problem.  The proposed research program seeks to advance energy efficient fluid separation processes critical to the global energy infrastructure. <br/><br/>This CAREER project will lay the scientific foundation for increased energy efficiency of chemical separations through organic solvent reverse osmosis (OSRO) that utilizes membranes to differentiate organic molecules based on size and shape. The project will probe the diffusion, sorption, and permeation mechanisms of molecular transport in OSRO membranes for candidate organic solvent molecules that simulate complex feed mixtures. Foundational structure-transport relationships for the new OSRO separation platform will be developed that will lead to rational design of membrane materials for organic liquid separations, new experiments and techniques for exploring the OSRO separations, all of which will lead to proof-of-principle that organic liquids can be separated via reverse osmosis.  The proposed research will lay the foundation for osmotic separations of organic liquids, which have the potential to revolutionize molecular separations in the chemical, bio-based chemical, and pharmaceutical industries.  One graduate student and two undergraduates will be trained in this project.  An educational outreach plan includes outreach efforts to directly involve female and underrepresented minorities in the laboratory, as well as lead on-going outreach efforts to these groups.  The project will engage  students in the creation of hands-on demonstrations regarding laboratory modules, energy consumption of chemical separations, and increase the impact of these demonstrations through on-line dissemination."

One particularly vexing problem concerns the age of birds. Estimates based on the rate of DNA evolution suggest modern birds started to evolve about 160 million-years ago; the fossil record however, suggests an age that is scarcely older than 66 million years. Explaining the ~100-million-year gap in the fossil record profoundly limits our ability to understand when, how, and why modern bird diversity came to be. This project examines disagreements between molecular divergence time analyses and the avian fossil record, and studies a new hypothesis to explain the observed discrepancy. The project synthesizes data from paleontological and genomic datasets with predictions from population genetic theory. This work also paves the way for an integrative approach to studying evolutionary patterns across other branches of the tree of life. Moreover, the study investigates the effects of the K/Pg  (Cretaceous-Paleogene) mass extinction, with important implications for understanding the decimation of Mesozoic dinosaurs and their resurrection in the form of modern birds. Such work may reveal fundamental clues into how and when Earth's modern biodiversity arose. Finally, the researchers will take advantage of the diverse outreach mechanisms at the Cornell Lab of Ornithology to communicate their findings to a broad audience.<br/><br/>In the first part of the project, the researchers will study the age of modern birds using a variety of simulation, empirical and theoretical approaches grounded in the study of systematics. The researchers will use recent developments in Bayesian modeling to test the hypothesis that transient miniaturization of body size in the wake of the K/Pg mass extinction can explain a period of molecular rate acceleration in the extinction's aftermath. In the second part of the project, the researchers will study the feasibility of reconstructing unknown life history traits from extant and extinct taxa, conditioned on inferred rates of molecular evolution. A key component of the work will be to advance expertise in distributed high performance computing for phylogenetics, and in analyzing data related to avian life history evolution. In general, the research will leverage the recognition that rates of genome evolution are an important axis of life history variation to promote a progressive approach to studying paleo-life history diversity, and enable the integration of historically disparate information sources. The research will have potentially broad significance to comparative biology and phylogenetics, and may influence the field of divergence time analysis in both the short and long term."

The project will advance knowledge in electrochemical reduction reactions for two targeted applications. The first is a Lithium-O2 battery (commonly called a lithium-air) for transportation applications. This battery chemistry promises high energy and power density that would be required for propulsion in an automobile. The second application is for CO2 electrochemical reduction, a method to sequester or reuse CO2 and convert it into a higher valued fuel or chemical. Both of these applications share the need for more fundamental knowledge on how the underlying electrochemical reduction reactions work within the device, whether a battery or CO2 conversion device. This project looks at how the electrolyte phase in the device interacts with the electrode where the key reduction chemistry occurs on the surface of the electrode. The project looks at electrolyte components that could act as charge carriers to facilitate the key electrochemical reactions that take place at the interface of the electrode surface and the electrolyte medium. This fundamental research may provide a route to energy sustainability and reduced vehicle emissions. The educational plan will leverage research and outreach activities to benefit the electrochemical engineering research community and graduate and undergraduate and pre-college students in the East Bay Area of San Francisco, California. The PI is expanding undergraduate student research experiences with a symposium and mentoring program. To fill a gap in available electrochemical engineering educational resources, a series of online video modules will be constructed to teach fundamental concepts to scientists and students interested in electrochemistry.  Outreach activities will also continue to teach simple electrochemical concepts to underrepresented elementary students in East Bay communities.<br/><br/>The overall objective of this proposed research is to improve efficiency and selectivity of important electrochemical reduction reactions, specifically O2 and CO2 reduction, by incorporation of appropriately selected redox-active molecules (redox mediators) into the electrolyte. Redox mediators are molecules that undergo a reversible charge transfer reaction where the forward reaction describes the reduction reaction and the reverse reaction describes the oxidation reaction. The PI has shown in preliminary work that the nonaqueous oxygen reduction reaction mechanism can be beneficially manipulated through the inclusion of redox-active molecules into the electrolyte. Improved selectivity and energy efficiency has been indicated using this approach although the underlying mechanisms are unclear and could be related to interactions between O2, reduced oxygen intermediates, electrons, the redox mediator, and ions in solution. The project will also look at CO2 electrochemical reduction reactions, particularly to form multi-carbon products for fuels or chemicals. The use of redox mediators could open an entirely new avenue of research on the CO2 reduction reaction. The project will look at both electron/ion transfer to O2/CO2 and employ selected redox molecules that will impact the mechanism of the O2 and CO2 reduction reactions thereby providing a route to improved product selectivity and efficiency. The project's tasks will leverage unique quantitative experimental capabilities, including quantification of product distributions using, differential electrochemical mass spectrometry, online electrochemical gas chromatography, and nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy. The PI will identify useful classes of redox-active molecules that can alter the mechanism of charge transfer to O2 and CO2, thereby providing a route to improving desirable product formation selectivity and energy efficiency in each system."

Dysphagia risk is currently assessed via screening, and a failed screen then leads to the diagnostic gold-standard, the videofluoroscopic x-ray test. However, many patients who aspirate (take food or drink into their lungs) pass initial screens because they aspirate silently. Therefore, this CAREER project proposes to develop fundamentally new computational tools to be used in conjunction with high-resolution vibration and sound recordings from the neck to screen for dysphagia.  First, the project will advance computational models to detect the activities of swallowing from vibration and sound recordings from the neck. Second, the project will advance techniques for making vibration and sound recordings from the neck to better understand how the airway normally protects itself during swallowing to avoid aspiration, and how this is affected during dysphagia.  Success in this project will reduce incidence of silent aspiration, but it will also reduce the necessity for overly conservative recommendations that might limit eating and drinking for individuals with neurological disabilities (e.g. stroke, MS, ALS) who are at greater risk of dysphagia.  Educational and outreach activities focus on increasing interest in applying new computational techniques to swallowing disorders, as well as encouraging underrepresented groups of students to pursue education and careers in STEM fields.<br/><br/>The PI's long-term research goal is to utilize computational approaches and instrumentation to nurture translation of innovative engineering research to clinically relevant solutions for dysphagia. Therefore, the research objective of this CAREER proposal is the advancement of fundamentally new data analytics tools to be used in conjunction with high-resolution cervical auscultation (HRCA - accelerometer and microphone recordings from the neck) in order to instrumentally screen for dysphagia. The HRCA screening device can detect pharyngeal vibrations caused by dysphagia. As of yet the current device cannot detect silent aspiration before patients are placed at risk. New fundamental advances in data analytics are needed, which is the main research contribution of the proposed program. The PI?s long-term educational goal is to translate advances in dysphagia data analytics into educational modules that will be disseminated to a wide clinical and engineering audience. Hence, the educational objective is to create interdisciplinary training opportunities for high school (e.g., educational modules to be distributed across the US), engineering undergraduate, and graduate students (e.g., an easily accessible open online course), while disseminating the results of this project to a clinical audience as well (e.g., grand rounds).

First, it will develop a general framework for understanding how a matching platform should best enable search for partners, as a function of market characteristics, motivated by the widespread difficulty faced by users in finding a suitable partner in many markets. Second, it will address the problem of matching when supply and demand are geographically and temporally distributed and the cost of a match increases with geographical separation between the agents, as is the case, for instance, in transportation markets.

Carbon dioxide is an abundant by-product of fossil fuels combustion.  Its conversion into other molecules with useful properties not only contributes to the long term supply of raw materials.  Many research groups are investigating ways to convert carbon dioxide into other useful molecules.   Clearly, better understating of how such conversions are done may lead to more effective ways of achieving such conversions.  Toward such a goal, Professor Alfredo Angeles-Boza is exploiting the differences in reactivity between forms of the same element (here, carbon and oxygen) that contain equal numbers of protons but different atomic masses for the study of materials used in such conversions.  The project lies at the interface of inorganic, physical and materials chemistry, and is well suited to the education of scientists at different levels, from high school students to Ph.D. graduates.  The program offers a multidisciplinary training ground for undergraduate and graduate<br/>students. The proposal includes year-round undergraduate research projects and is part of the departmental REU program.  A goal is to decrease the attrition rate among the students initially interested in sciences by working on three key issues: (i) tutoring to decrease the barriers that limit success in the early chemistry courses; (ii) assembling a group of like-minded Hispanic students as it is generally understood that such a group of a critical mass is needed to help bring a sense of familiarity to the students environment; and (iii) mentoring student to combat the lack of science-oriented minority role models. <br/><br/>To improve catalyst design, it is important to understand the origins of the kinetic barriers of the reactions.  This project is a comprehensively illuminates the chemical mechanisms of transition metal-catalyzed carbon dioxide reduction reactions. The project combines the use of synthesis, kinetics, and heavy atom (13C and 18O) isotope effects with density functional theory calculations to address bond formation, bond cleavage, and electron transfer mechanisms during carbon dioxide activation.  The project seeks to answer the following questions: (1) What values of 13C and 18O kinetic isotope effects characterize transition metal-catalyzed carbon dioxide reduction reactions? (2) Can the driving force and nucleophilicity of a catalyst influence the heavy atom isotope effects measured in carbon dioxide reduction reactions? (3) What 13C and 18O equilibrium isotope effects characterize the various transition metal- carbon dioxide binding modes?  For his educational plan, Professor Angeles-Boza is developing an effective learning community for students underrepresented in science."

Many celebrated results in logic from the first half of the 20th century concerned the existence of objects considered wild. Gdel's proof of the undecidability of arithmetic established that this structure is complicated (or wild) from a logical viewpoint. Such results are negative in spirit as they point to the limitations of mathematical reasoning. However, in the second half of the last century the focus changed. Model theorists found a vast number of tame mathematical structures that exhibit no such wildness, and for often very different reasons are amenable to model-theoretic methods. This program of identifying and analyzing tame classes of structures whose model theory can be understood came to be known as the geography of tame mathematics, and in its various forms has dominated model theory throughout the last thirty years. Although arising as a program of foundational importance, it has led to striking applications of model theory to other areas of mathematics, most recently to the Andr-Oort conjecture in number theory. Since this program is to explore areas of tame mathematics, these connections are not coincidental at all. The development of such interactions has proven again and again to have far reaching applications outside of logic that could not have been envisioned beforehand.<br/><br/>This project continues this line of research in the setting of expansions of the real line. It aims to settle important open questions within model theory, but also naturally develops new connections between model theory and other areas in logic such as neostability and descriptive set theory, and outside of logic such as geometric measure theory and geometric group theory. The investigator will lead a large scale investigation of dividing lines between tame and wild behavior arising in the study of the geometry of definable sets in ordered structures. Building on early advances, the investigator will determine far reaching consequences of various logical tameness conditions on the topological and metric tameness of definable sets. Furthermore, the project comprises new challenges in the classification of classes of structures considered tame. The educational component of this CAREER grant ties together the investigator's research with his teaching and outreach efforts. This project involves undergraduate and graduate students and young researchers in the investigator's research program, strengthens the ties between model theory and other branches of mathematics, and continues the investigator's outreach efforts in the Urbana-Champaign area."

The research focuses on both archival and published materials that were collected in China, Taiwan, and the United States. It will investigate the process through which Euro-American and Japanese fingerprint identification techniques were introduced to China and subsequently adopted for a range of local and national state-building efforts and scientific research activities over the course of the twentieth century. A major objective of this project is to explore the persistent connections which have existed during this period between Chinese fingerprinting and the global history of dermatoglyphics, an international scientific discipline which is concerned with anthropological, medical, and genetic understandings of fingerprint and palm patterning. The main research outcomes of this project will be the collection of historical data and significant progress toward the completion of an academic monograph on this topic. This project thus has the potential to contribute to the developing infrastructure of basic research underlying latent print examination and to assist forensic science practitioners and researchers as they work to strengthen the integrity of the evidence on which the U.S. justice system relies, an outcome of broad societal importance.<br/><br/>Technical Summary   <br/><br/>The project will broaden the scope of existing scholarship on the history of fingerprinting, which has largely focused on the role of the British Empire in the development and transfer of modern identification practices across the globe, by focusing on the case of China, which was influenced in equal measure by the fingerprinting practices of Britain and Japan. The main outcome of the project will be the first academic monograph on the history of dermatoglyphics, the core techniques and concepts of the discipline, and the professional associations and networks which have structured international collaboration in this field over the course of the twentieth century. The work will provide a new perspective on the ways in which scientific understandings of racial identity and difference have been negotiated in modern East Asia amid the ethno-racial politics of imperialism, colonialism, and post-colonial state-building which have played out in this region.

Elder care facilities aim to maintain or improve the quality of life and independence of elders while reducing costs and capacity needs for care-professionals. One key to achieving this goal is to understand the activities of each occupant. Existing solutions to monitor occupants, such as vision, acoustic, motion, and force sensors and mobile devices, have strict installation requirements. These requirements lead to intrusive and dense deployment or require active user involvements. Instead, this project is built upon sensing the vibrations created by occupants' during their walking activity.  Using building vibration to monitor occupants allows non-intrusive and scalable monitoring with inexpensive vibration sensors. More generally, this research will enable smart buildings to sense, track, and predict the status of occupants in a maintainable way using ""structures as sensors"" and thus enable future occupant-aware applications. Similarly, the technology can locate portions of a building with slippery or unsafe footing, or detect the presence of unauthorized people in restricted areas. By tracking first responders and locating imperiled civilians, such systems will also help dispatchers to mitigate emergencies. The project includes proof-of-concept deployments in three different elder care facilities. Targeted outreach activities will highlight the capabilities of this technology at an appropriate level of detail to appeal to female middle-school students.<br/><br/>This project uses structures themselves as activity sensors, by passively sensing footstep-induced floor vibrations, and employing advanced sparse-signal approximation in a Bayesian framework, to extract individual activity information. The specific research thrusts are: (1) extracting individual persons' footstep-induced floor vibration signal from a noisy signal mixture due to multiple human sources, by exploiting hierarchical wavelet decompositions and applying structured sparsity regularization; (2) localizing individual footsteps by dynamically fusing information from multiple frequency components and leveraging human mobility and structural vibration patterns through Bayesian updating; and (3) improving model accuracy by iteratively fusing location information and signal separation. The key novelty in these thrusts lies in fusion of signal processing methods and physical constraints to address real world challenges."

The approach to equilibrium involves a system ""forgetting"" information about its initial state. For example, if a gas is initially put in the left side of a tube, and then is allowed to spread throughout the tube, it eventually forgets which side it started out in. This apparent ""forgetting"" is at odds with the laws of quantum mechanics, which in fact conserve information; it is believed that information about the initial state is never truly forgotten, but is stored in complicated, experimentally inaccessible correlations. How information migrates from measurable to hidden correlations is in general not understood. <br/><br/>This project approaches the general question from the perspective of states of matter related to glasses, in which ""forgetting"" is extremely slow. In the intermediate regimes, some sectors of the system are in equilibrium, whereas others are far from it. New theoretical methods that generalize conventional statistical mechanics are required to characterize these intermediate regimes. Developing such methods and using them to identify distinctive features of these intermediate regimes are primary objectives of this project. The other major focus of this project is to use slowly equilibrating systems for novel quantum applications, including heat engines, quantum memories, and sensors. Since equilibration corresponds to the forgetting or hiding of information, systems that are slow to equilibrate retain information for very long times; this observation underlies the various applications that will be explored in this project. <br/><br/>This project will take place at the College of Staten Island, which has a diverse student body including large proportions of first-generation college students, underrepresented minorities, and recent immigrants.

These include isolated systems that are nearly integrable or nearly many-body localized, as well as related open systems. The main goals of this project are threefold: to develop computational methods suited to slowly thermalizing systems, to characterize distinctively non-thermal features of distribution functions in such systems, and to apply these distinctive features to quantum technologies. <br/><br/>The first main goal is to develop methods to describe the dynamics of slowly thermalizing systems. Existing approaches are typically limited to short times and/or small systems, owing to the growth of entanglement. This project will develop methods tailored to the intermediate and late-time behavior of slowly thermalizing systems. Specifically, field theories of the prethermalized regime, as well as mean-field and renormalization-group techniques that leverage the separation of timescales between interactions and thermalization to describe the emergence of thermal behavior. These methods will be applied to experiments involving ultracold atomic systems that are nearly integrable (one-dimensional dipolar gases) or many-body localized. The second main goal is to characterize the probability distributions of physical observables in slowly thermalizing systems, focusing on many-body localization. Such distributions are expected to be fat-tailed; this project will characterize these tails, and their implications for observables such as the nonlinear response. The third main goal is to explore applications of non-thermalizing systems (again, focusing on the many-body localized case) for quantum information science, quantum metrology, and quantum thermodynamics. <br/><br/>This project will take place at the College of Staten Island, which has a diverse student body including large proportions of first-generation college students, underrepresented minorities, and recent immigrants.

The realization that drag forces exerted on a body moving through air (or water) take place on a thin layer around the body lead to the development of boundary layer theory. The practical importance of boundary layer theory in aerodynamics and hydrodynamics is immense: computing the drag on an object and the energy dissipation rate nearby, with implications for fuel efficiency; understanding the problem of wing stall, the dependence of the lift on the angle of attack; and even the enhancement of heat transfer near solid walls. Mathematically, these questions concern the behavior of solutions to the Navier-Stokes equations in the vanishing viscosity limit, and the stability of the ensuing boundary layers.  This project will develop new analytical tools to study the validity of the vanishing viscosity limit, the formation of singularities in boundary layers, and to explore the nonlinear stability mechanisms by which these lead to dynamic boundary layer separation. This theoretical information will lead to more accurate reduced models and finer predictions about real fluid flows. The project will train undergraduate, graduate, and post-graduate researchers, in modern research problems in applied mathematics and the tools to study them.<br/><br/>This project aims to develop new mathematical tools that will further our understanding of the vanishing viscosity limit: the question whether solutions of the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations converge to solutions of the incompressible Euler equations as the viscosity approaches zero, in the presence of a characteristic physical boundary. For fixed external parameters, the vanishing viscosity limit is equivalent to the infinite Reynolds number limit, and thus this problem is of vital importance to the study of the onset of turbulence in fluid flows. The PI and collaborators will address the emergence of singularities in the Prandtl boundary layer equations by establishing more robust finite time blow-up scenarios. The stability of nearly laminar boundary layers will be studied via a hypocoercive analysis of the Prandtl system and of higher order models. Finally, the PI will develop new energy methods that intertwine Eulerian and Lagrangian approaches to prove the vanishing viscosity limit in high regularity regimes. The goal is to develop nonlinear, solution-adapted methods. Graduate students and post-doctoral fellows will be mentored and included in the research activities."

Redox-active ligands with modified donor substituents and structures are being prepared to identify ligand variations that promote electrochemical reduction of MLC-bound carbon dioxide.   Metal complexes containing redox-inactive tetradentate ligands are being used as benchmarks to elucidate the role of ligand redox chemistry in electrochemical carbon dioxide reduction via MLC binding.

Burrowing organisms can inhabit a wide range of subsurface soil types, and adopt a variety of burrowing strategies such as fracturing, digging, bulk fluidization, localized fluidization, localized grain rearrangement and compaction, facilitated by rhythmically changing their body shape.  Several different species such as earthworms and bivalve mollusks possess extraordinary burrowing efficiency compared to most man-made penetrometers.  Why the dynamic change in body shape is able to facilitate penetration in particulate soil is still largely unknown.  From a geomechanical perspective, this award supports the discovery and fundamental understanding of the interaction between soil and bio-inspired penetrators with dynamic shapes.  This research has potential to inspire the development of next-generation, high-efficiency underground construction technologies and versatile small-scale underground penetrometers.  Application of these technologies can help reduce energy consumption and improve productivity; and underground sensing networks enabled by bio-inspired burrowing can help monitor the safety of infrastructure.  Small, agile underground robots can also be used for normal geotechnical engineering site characterization, and also regions that are normally difficult to reach due to energy and environmental restrictions, such as the exploration of Mars or sites on Earth that are liquefied or damaged due to natural hazards (e.g., earthquakes, landslides, flooding, etc.).  In addition, the new knowledge and techniques obtained through this research can be used to develop an understanding of the mechanical interactions between animal and sediment as well as shed light on the ecology and evolution of burrowing organisms.  This research will serve as a platform to promote learning, teaching and training: the interdisciplinary and bio-inspired nature of the research is an ideal outreach topic to generate enthusiasm in K-12 students and the public about STEM education and research; the integration of the research approaches and findings into teaching and mentoring will help improve the image of geotechnical engineering and invoke students' interests in interdisciplinary research.   The education objective of this project is to utilize this bio-inspired research to educate various audiences, including K-12 students, undergraduate and graduate students, and the general public, on biomimicry research for geotechnical engineering via two major pathways: (1) Partnering with GLBio, a dedicated organization in biomimicry innovation and education, the research outcomes will be disseminated to a broader audience including K-12 students and the general public.  In collaboration with GLBio, a mobile interactive demo booth and an adaptable lecture module on the burrowing mechanism will be developed to educate the audience about biomimicry and interdisciplinary research.  Outreach activities will be performed through GLBio's network, which includes schools, zoos, and museums in northeast Ohio. (2) A regional alliance for geotechnical engineering education in northeast Ohio (NEOGeo), involving public and private universities as well as local industry partners, will be established to integrate the educational resources and to improve their educational quality.  To promote diversity and equality, priority will be given to qualified students from historically underrepresented groups (females and African-Americans), as well as students from low-income families and economically disadvantaged regions when recruiting students for the research program.<br/><br/>The research objective of project is to investigate the interaction between granular materials and bio-inspired penetrators with dynamic shape through integrated experimental and numerical models.  The complexity of burrowing lies in the tempo-spatial change in the boundaries between granular materials and the burrower, as well as the solid-flow transition of the granular material.  Experimental digital image correlation (DIC) techniques and the numerical discrete element method (DEM) are ideal for characterizing and modeling the granule dynamics, providing key multi-scale information to fully understand this dynamic structure-granule interaction problem.  In this research, (1) a simple two-component apparatus utilizing an ""artificial muscle"" will be designed to mimic the burrowing kinematics of clams; penetration experiments with the artificial clam will provide ground truth multiscale observations of the soil-burrower interaction using DIC; (2) a virtual calibration chamber based on DEM will be developed and validated, and it will be used to investigate more fundamental mechanisms of burrowing at multiple length and time scales, as well as to systematically survey the effects of soil properties, soil stress states and burrower kinematics on burrowing performance.  This research will ultimately answer the following questions: 1) Given a certain type of soil, how does the penetrator's changing shape affect the penetration efficiency? 2) Given the penetrator's dynamics and kinematics, how does the penetration efficiency (resistance) correlate to soil properties."

Professor Nagib's research team seeks to simultaneously increase interest, participation, retention, and literacy in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) fields by (a) offering hands-on research experience via a summer internship program for a diverse group of high-school and undergraduate students; (b) sharing interactive science demonstrations with local K-12 students; (c) creating informative and accessible visual media for the general public; and (d) sharing knowledge and research about radical chemistry through social media, online forums, and community outreach activities.<br/><br/>This integrated research, education, and outreach program is focused on enabling a complementary class of polarity-reversed, radical reactivity for carbonyls. The transformation of this ubiquitous synthetic handle from its native, electrophilic nature to an umpolung, nucleophilic ketyl radical is achieved through an anomeric activation strategy. This approach relies on in situ conversion of carbonyls to alpha-oxy intermediates, which are better suited for radical generation using mild catalysts derived from earth-abundant metals. This dual-catalytic strategy for generation of ketyl radicals is superior to current approaches that rely on strong, stoichiometric reductants to overcome the high reduction potential for single electron transfer (SET) to carbonyls. This technology has broad applicability for the development of sustainable tools for streamlining the synthesis of complex medicines and materials.  Integrated outreach activities involving multimedia demonstration of the vital role of free radicals and organic chemistry in daily life is also a key aspect of this funded project."

The project focuses on the 1940s, which was an important transition decade between the Great Depression of the 1930s and the sustained growth of the 1950s and 1960s.  Even after World War II ended in 1945, unemployment and income inequality remained low and wage growth remained high.  To understand the success of workers during the mid-20th Century, the investigator creates a new data set from historical surveys that record the employment, unemployment, occupational histories, and geographic moves for thousands of individual workers from 1940 through 1950.  With the new data, the investigator will track the experiences of many different types of individuals, including civilians, veterans, immigrants, etc. in order to understand how the U.S. economy rose from the ""secular stagnation"" of the 1930s to the prosperous 1950s and 1960s.<br/><br/>This research gathers new data in order to study U.S. labor market dynamics during the 1940s.  This decade represented an important transition from the ""secular stagnation"" of the 1930s to the sustained growth path of the 1950s and 1960s.  The goals of the project are (i) to understand why the events of the 1940s led to lasting changes in unemployment and inequality; (ii) to characterize the factors that allowed the labor market to reallocate workers quickly and efficiently despite some of the biggest shifts in sectoral demand in history; and (iii) to analyze which factors helped individuals move up the occupation and earnings ladder.  The most important part of the project is the use of archival sources to construct a new worker-level longitudinal dataset of employment, unemployment, and non-employment spells from 1940 through 1950. These sources also contain rich demographic and labor market detail.  Comparisons will be made between the experiences of workers during the 1940s to those from more recent times, using modern longitudinal data sources such as the Panel Study of Income Dynamics."

While this method originates in foundational questions, over the years profound applications to the study of many central objects of classical mathematics and computer science were discovered. This project will investigate an emerging connection to the area of graph theory. Graphs are the basic discrete mathematical objects used to model networks and related systems. In combinatorics, one often investigates the asymptotic behavior of various quantitative properties (such as the density of the edges, or the size of a certain regular pattern) for large finite graphs. Model theory provides a method of converting asymptotic quantitative questions about properties of a family of graphs into qualitative questions about the shape, volume or dimension of a certain limiting infinite object (via the so-called ultraproduct construction). Infinitary model-theoretic machinery to study such limit objects will be used to address questions in finite graph combinatorics, and conversely rich body of results in combinatorics will be used to attack open questions in model theory.<br/><br/>As demonstrated in the previous work of the principal investigator and other researchers, recent advances on pseudo-randomness and Ramsey-type phenomena for restricted families of graphs (e.g. semialgebraic regularity lemma by Fox et al., Tao's algebraic regularity lemma over finite fields, regularity lemma for graphs of finite Vapnik-Chervonenkis dimension by Lovasz-Szegedy, etc.) admit a uniform model-theoretic treatment well-aligned with the methods and ideas in Shelah's classification theory. This project initiates a systematic program of investigating these connections, centered around the study of Keisler measures and various model-theoretic notions of dimension (e.g. coming from forking independence or pseudofinite counting) in tame classes of first-order structures (stable, distal, dependent, simple, NTP2, etc.), as well as the finer questions on generalized ""incidence bounds"" and their relation to Zilber's trichotomy phenomena."

A growing subset of travelers make decisions informed by apps that optimize (mixed-mode) routes based on user-defined preferences. Locally optimized solutions tend to cause inefficiencies that are exacerbated by risk-sensitivity (arising from endogenous and exogenous uncertainties) in travelers. Traditional rational, utility maximization models tend not to capture these effects, particularly in short-horizon decisions that leave little time for cogitation and points of reference play a primary role in choice. The project aims to (a) learn models of traveler decision-making that account for risk-sensitivity and (b) develop models of market structures (e.g., ride-sharing platforms) that capture traveler valuations of mobility modes. <br/><br/>The proposed research extends rational models of travel decisions by leveraging prospect theory for capturing risk-sensitivity and bounded rationality for capturing information asymmetries and myopia. These concepts will be integrated into an inverse reinforcement learning framework for which we seek online algorithms in support of control/incentive design. Moreover, we will develop technical approaches to modeling mobility market structures that include new queuing game-theoretic models that capture risk-sensitivity. The proposed work will benefit from multi-modal transit data available via municipal and industry partners for testing and validation within a well-developed testbed.<br/><br/>This project will highlight areas where municipalities can adjust their management strategies to supplement the sharing economy in addressing the service gap in an equitable way.

Polymers are widespread and have become an indispensable part of life.  Different polymers have different properties and applications.  Polymers incorporating photoactive metal ions allow the tuning of optical and mechanical properties of the polymers with light.  These polymers can potentially be used as advanced healable or scratch-resistant coatings. They may also be patterned using light and used for biological applications such as tissue engineering.  For her educational plan, Professor Ostrowski is working to promote community and student engagement by connecting chemistry to students' everyday lives through exploration of polymers from local plants.  She is also developing low cost mobile-phone based technologies for do-it-yourself color measurements.  These low cost technologies are useful tools for teaching students spectroscopy and photochemistry.<br/><br/>In more technical terms, Professor Ostrowski's goal is to control the mechanical properties of materials by controlling the metal coordination bonding interactions in the polymers.  To enable the design of such materials, a deep understanding of the mechanisms involved in the metal-polymer assembly and reactivity is required. To develop these structure-function relationships, the dynamics of the metal-coordination interactions in the metallopolymer systems are varied in order to change the bulk properties (e.g. stiffness and elasticity, and photoreactivity).  Previous work has focused on materials with ligands presenting specific coordination geometry, and metal ions that lack photochemical reactivity. This project focuses on developing materials with variable ligand binding geometries.  Specific systems include 1) biocompatible polysaccharide polymers (e.g. alginate) and 2) model synthetic polymers containing tunable ligand groups-- both coordinated to a variety of transition metals such as iron, cobalt, copper and manganese in different oxidation states."

It examines the role of technological change in efforts of the mill to stay in business; in doing so, it expects to show how individuals and communities in the contemporary US transition from an old form of manufacturing centered on manual labor and mass production to a new digitally equipped one. The theoretical aim of the project is to contribute to studies in STS on human-technology interactions in the workplace by developing more complex narratives about human-automata interchangeability. The project will involve both intensive collaborative factory-based ethnographic research and engineering projects involving engineering students and senior personnel in materials science and mechanical engineering/robotics.

She is an anthropologist who teaches anthropology to engineers, and values bringing anthropological understandings to public audiences and into the engineering classroom. She will share her research findings from this project with engineering students as part of a continual effort to engage with critical questions that impact the choices engineering students make in their engineering work. The project will also be an important resource for consumers and business people; it will point to important lessons to be learned from the sociological life of textiles and their fabrication, including larger lessons for other manufacturing in the US.<br/><br/>Technical Summary  <br/><br/>The PI aims to analyze the experiences of people and the contexts of those experiences all along the production process at the textile factory site; she plans to pay equal attention to the goals and stresses of the president and to those of the minimum-wage production worker. She will leverage the expertise of engineering colleagues to analyze how humans and machinery are transformed together in contemporary US manufacturing. More broadly, she will brings anthropological methods to long-studied questions in the history of technology, such as human-machine interaction, automation in the workplace, and the changing meanings of labor. Her analysis will include relationships among materials, machinery, workers, and managers, and how automation impacts the meaning, structure, and experience of work for people at all workforce levels. The project will engage with work in economics and in STS studies on whether robotics and automation will someday render human labor obsolete. Her working hypothesis is that workers and managers enroll a combination of analog and digital technologies in their quest to continue manufacturing domestically in novel, understudied ways. She aims to disrupt the popular narrative that robots will replace humans in the workplace, by hypothesizing that digital technology and processes can keep workers employed and can stimulate novel sensory experiences as opposed to merely eliminating them."

The research derives from the observation that object grasping and manipulation using conventional teleoperation approaches places a significant control burden on the human operator and reduces task performance.  This is because indirect manipulation of an object through a robot hand may cause inaccurate or undesired robot motion, while the limited control inputs available to the operator (e.g., joystick, data glove) make direct kinematic mapping challenging for complex object manipulation tasks.  So the human operator must mentally and physically transform (e.g., rotate, translate, scale, deform) the desired robot actions to required inputs at the interface; these transformations significantly increase control difficulty.  The primary research goal of this project is to develop a novel goal-guided self-reflective control interface (GSRCI), which will enable the robot to understand the operator's high-level objective during an object-grasping operation and to conform to task constraints in order to reduce control difficulties and ensure the success of subsequent manipulation.  The primary educational activity derives from the common deficiency of distance learning programs supported by existing teleconferencing technologies, namely that they offer limited or no opportunities for hands-on learning.  To address this problem, an interactive distance learning system (IDLS) will be developed that immerses remote students in the classroom environment through student tele-controlling of a robot's arms and hands for object manipulation and/or interaction with other classmates, thereby enabling remote users to feel present in the classroom and engaged in class activities.  The task modeling technology as well as the goal-guided control interface technology from the research work will be coupled to develop an easy and intuitive teleoperation-based distance learning system for K-12 students.  The GSRCI represents transformative technology with the potential to provide a new paradigm of HRI that will significantly improve the power and quality of teleoperation and broadly impact applications related to diverse domains including assistance for the elderly and disabled, minimally invasive surgery, space and underwater explorations, military reconnaissance, nuclear servicing, and urban search and rescue.  The IDLS will foster engagement for remote students and allow them to successfully participate in STEM activities, offering disadvantaged groups the potential to learn regardless of their ability to physically attend a class setting.<br/><br/>To achieve these goals, a cognitive interface will be created that enables a robot to flexibly reproduce actions that accommodate the operator's motion inputs as well as autonomously regulate these actions in a self-reflective manner to compensate task constraints that facilitate subsequent manipulations.  A novel goal-achievement indicator will predict the level of goal accomplishment for the planned action.  Additionally, a goal-guided remedial planner will regulate this action to accomplish the goal by relaxing the constraint bound of the operator's motion inputs using an adaptive local search strategy.  New models for human and robot task-based grasp behaviors will also be developed, which will provide a knowledge base to infer human goals in a task and to conduct goal-guided robot-grasp planning.  To link quantified task constraints with symbolic tasks, account for uncertainty in task modeling, and allow task reasoning from partially observed data, a directed probabilistic Bayesian model will encode the statistical dependence among the task goal, object attributes, actions, and task constraints."

The aims of this project are to determine how the distribution of fish and invertebrates has changed over time along the Texas coast and to assess the extent to which these changes are attributable to changes in local environmental conditions, such as sea surface temperature, coastal sea level, salinity, turbidity, and river discharge rate. Studies of biological systems in the Gulf of Mexico are lacking compared to coastal research in the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Addressing these regional knowledge gaps is crucial because the Gulf of Mexico supports a wide diversity of temperate and tropical species that are ecologically and economically important. Poleward shifts in species distributions associated with increasing sea surface temperature have been observed along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts. In contrast, the northern edge of the Gulf of Mexico is bound by land that places biogeographic constraints on the potential responses of coastal organisms to changing environmental conditions. This project will use advanced statistical methods to analyze long-term species composition data for the northwestern Gulf of Mexico and characterize past relationships of species composition and local environmental conditions. These findings will help guide the development of predictive models to assess potential biological responses to projected environmental conditions. Research results will be shared with local and state resource agencies responsible for managing coastal fisheries. As an integral part of this project, a three-level (faculty-graduate-undergraduate) mentoring system will be established to promote diversity in science through undergraduate and graduate training. Undergraduate students will be recruited through the Texas A&M University Chapter of the Society for Advancement of Chicano and Native Americans in Science (SACNAS), for which the principal investigator is currently a faculty advisor. Both graduate and undergraduate students will work as a team on the project and develop quantitative data analysis and other general scientific skills. Finally, the research program will be used as a case study for establishing mentoring systems for promoting diversity in science.  <br/><br/>The availability of long-term species composition data provides a unique opportunity to substantially improve knowledge toward understanding the effects of climate change on marine organisms in a low latitude system. This project will examine species composition data for eight bays distributed over approximately 650 km of the Texas coast; comprehensive data of this type are uncommon elsewhere. The biological data have been collected over 35-40 years as part of a long-term monitoring program and includes information on more than 1000 species of fish and invertebrates. This unique dataset will be analyzed using modern statistical approaches, including occupancy data analysis, co-integration method, and state-space vector autoregressive modeling. These methods overcome common difficulties in statistical analyses, including datasets having multi-collinearity among independent variables and those involving non-stationarity. Based on the results of the statistical analyses, models enabling the prediction of species composition under projected local environmental conditions will be developed. As part of this project, undergraduate and graduate students will acquire expertise in contemporary analytical methods, research findings will be broadly shared with both the academic and resource management communities, and computational code will be made publically available. This project will provide better understanding of the effects of environmental conditions on fish and invertebrate distribution and will provide valuable information for improved fishery management and conservation efforts under changing environmental conditions."

However, the existence of fractures in these rock bodies, which are a common feature of most deep rocks, complicates our ability to understand how these formations will behave during either extraction or storage activities. Fractures in sedimentary rock can provide fast flow pathways along which focused and possibly channelized flow can occur. They can likewise provide a plane along which fluids can rapidly come into contact and react with surrounding rock. Our ability to understand flow within prominent fracture planes, however, is limited using existing testing methods. The purpose of this project is: 1) To further develop novel testing methods for understanding fracture flow processes; 2) To evaluate the sensitivity of these testing methods to various features of fractures (e.g., fracture aperture variability, fracture stiffness); and 3) To evaluate the real-world performance of these testing methods at a field-scale research site where complex fracture flow is known to occur. A broader goal of this project, similarly, is to better educate both developing hydrologists and the public at large about the importance of rock fractures and their impact on aquifer flow and transport. By building a ?visible fracture? physical model, we will produce an educational tool that allows students and others to see and assess the movement of contaminants through complex fracture planes. This educational tool, along with other groundwater educational exhibits, will be displayed across the state through a touring ""pop-up"" science exhibit that brings hands-on hydrogeology to the surrounding rural community.<br/><br/>Pore spaces within sedimentary rock often provide the majority of storage space for water and may be the primary contributor by volume to fluid flow. However, fractures in sedimentary rock drastically complicate the understanding of flow and transport in these bodies. Fractures can make transport pathways quite complex, with a combination of diffuse flow through the sediment pore spaces (i.e., primary porosity), focused and possibly channelized flow through fractures (i.e. secondary porosity), and a concomitant exchange of fluids between these two domains. Understanding the impact of each of these processes is crucial for improving predictions of contaminant transport in these aquifers, as they control the rates of solute movement through the aquifer, the spreading of solute plumes, and the ability of solutes to exchange and react chemically with the host rock. Oscillatory hydraulic testing--in which fluid pressure within a reservoir is varied sinusoidally at a set frequency and pressure responses are recorded--has been suggested repeatedly as a useful strategy for characterizing rock fractures. Application of this testing in practice, however, has shown unexpected responses, in which a tested rock fracture appears to have ""frequency dependent"" hydraulic properties, implying complex flow within the fracture plane. To quote Guiltinan and Becker (2015) this ""suggests that the period-dependency of apparent hydraulic parameters is a result of heterogeneous flow and storage in the formation. Thus, periodic hydraulic testing may provide a means to characterizing flow channeling in bedrock fractures and fracture networks."" This proposal will assess this and other hypotheses for frequency dependence using numerical experiments and field-scale fractured rock testing. Through numerical experiments, the project will assess the ability of multi-frequency oscillatory hydraulic testing to distinguish between different flow processes in fractured sedimentary rock. At the field scale, detailed oscillatory flow testing will be implemented--alone and alongside gas injection experiments--to assess the contributions of flow channeling and fracture-host rock exchange at a controlled research site. Using oscillatory hydraulic tomography (OHT) imaging, which has shown significant promise at the laboratory scale, this work will first assess the degree of heterogeneity and flow channeling within a fracture plane. Following this, changes in the response of the rock fracture to OHT testing will be assessed after gas injection. This multi-frequency pumping test approach represents a powerful tool for characterizing flow in that it will measure hydrologic response (and thus, hydrologic processes) over a range of timescales."

It is also planned to develop campus-wide course on immune engineering aimed at freshman undergraduates for non-STEM majors.<br/><br/>The goal of engineering of vaccine and immune therapy for pathogens and cancers is to achieve long-term immune memory, which is maintained by memory T and B cells. Among various B and T cell subtypes, the long lasting CD8+ T cell memory is an attractive target because of its high specificity, exquisite sensitivity, and durable killing effect. High affinity T cell receptor-based T cell engineering has shown great therapeutic potential in cancer and persistent viral infection. However, a critical problem is how to educate these T cells to properly form memory. Since microRNAs have been implicated in many biological processes including memory T cell generation and their expression levels are easy to manipulate, we aim to combine several recently developed technologies in T cell profiling to systematically study the role of microRNA regulatory network in engineering T cell memory in this proposal. By interrogating T cell receptor binding strength dictated microRNA regulatory networks, our goal is to identify top microRNA regulatory nodes and manipulate and test their importance to engineering T cell memory. At the same time, it is proposed to leverage research effort to build an educational program in immune engineering. Through a new campus-wide course aimed at freshman undergraduates in non-STEM majors and associated activities including student-generated concepts for ""engineer T cell immunity"" and presentations to local middle and high school students, our educational activities will broaden participation in science on our campus and in our community, while simultaneously enhancing our proposed research efforts.

Advances in the construction sector have been incremental. This novel technique has the potential to revolutionize the way we construct and repair our infrastructure. One of the major advantages of 3-D concrete printing over conventional static formwork casting is the elimination of the use of formwork and vibration typically necessary for consolidation. This can reduce material and labor costs due to formwork, reduce material waste, cut construction time, and reduce human error. At the same time, form-free and vibration-free casting presents a significant materials engineering challenge to achieve the desired performance, serviceability, and aesthetics of the final structure in place. This award supports fundamental research to provide needed knowledge for the development of concrete systems specifically tailored for 3-D printing applications, where the fresh concrete must be both printable and exhibit the desired properties once it sets. The work will be readily integrated into a broader outreach and education program, Processing and Rheology for Infrastructure and Technology (P.R.I.N.T.), to instill that disruptive innovations in infrastructure have strong underpinnings in multidisciplinary science and engineering research.<br/><br/>Key challenges of 3-D concrete printing include achieving sufficient shape stability of the deposited mix, predicting working time, and controlling print speed. The aim of the project is to address each of these issues by identifying and characterizing fundamental rheological parameters to quantitatively describe the reversible and irreversible stiffening behavior of fresh cement-based materials, then tie these parameters to the structural response of the material system to the printing process. The viscoelastic properties up to setting will be characterized by implementing steady-state and quasi-static shear rheological protocols designed to simulate the printing process, from which mix design methodologies will be proposed to enhance shape stability of printed layers after deposition and control working time. A relationship between pumping pressure and print speed will be formulated based on the steady-state rheological properties of pastes modeling the lubrication layer and shear-induced particle migration kinetics of mortars. Further, layer-by-layer 3-D concrete printing introduces an additional consideration of the interlayer, which is novel and unique to this construction technique. The resulting microstructure of the interlayer in printed samples will be characterized and then refined through adjusting the viscoelastic properties and phase change of the material, then tied to the final mechanical performance of the printed element."

The plant kingdom quietly and efficiently goes about its life without the aid of muscle tissue. Despite this lack, plants can produce large and even rapid movements using water as the driving force. These movements enable energy harvesting. This award supports research efforts that use this osmosis-driven motion as inspiration. In leveraging plant architectures, the synthetic plant-tissue-analogs resulting from these efforts will provide a non-toxic, energy efficient, and tailored response. Simultaneously, such materials would require no connection to an external power support when used in water. The anticipated response of these hydraulic structures may be tuned to provide response variation as a function of both time and position. Responses such as these are essential for many tissue therapies and will benefit society via applications in healthcare and biomechanics. Further, the fundamental efforts supported by this award will enrich understanding of the hydraulic response of plants, a necessary component of detailed climate models. Educational activities for STEM outreach to young female athletes at sport camps will also be developed and extracurricular seminars on communication/rhetoric for scientific presentations will be established in collaboration with an English professor at the University of Illinois.<br/><br/>The research team will develop a constitutive model for this currently undescribed class of materials by building on existing theories of poroelasticity for solids capable of finite deformation.

As validation of the final model, dynamically and/or inhomogeneously-deforming, architected composites will be designed and fabricated with an aim toward metastable, hierarchical self-assembled structures. In successfully modeling these materials, this work will fill an existing gap in the understanding of 'water relations' in plant tissue.

For many years, research in superconducting quantum bits (or ""qubits"") was focused mainly on reducing noise in individual devices, but recent breakthroughs in coherence have made much larger circuits a reality, and new devices will soon reach a level of complexity where it is impossible to simulate them with regular computers. The PI will propose and coordinate new designs, experiments and applications for these devices that expand the frontiers of quantum computing. His research will study new methods for simulating exotic states of matter, correcting errors that occur from random noise, and using these qubits to more efficiently solve hard optimization problems. Graduate and undergraduate students will be trained and supported by the funding for this project. This program will also help the PI promote his research to aid commercial efforts to build quantum computers. The PI will also work in Tulane University's summer outreach program, to help attract middle and high school students to careers in science.<br/><br/>The scientific goals of this program are threefold. First, the PI's work will help researchers use photons trapped by superconducting qubits to simulate exotic states of matter, providing a new platform for testing predictions in quantum many-body physics. Second, the PI will explore applications of engineered dissipation, carefully tuned noise sources which can passively and automatically cancel out unwanted errors, and potentially speed up the process of solving hard optimization problems. Finally, the PI will work to integrate these passive error correction schemes with more traditional quantum error correction codes. In doing so, the PI will propose a new quantum computing architecture that could make it much easier to construct larger scale quantum computers."

SSL/TLS is currently being used to protect a large number of servers and websites including banks, file servers, and social networks. In fact, 37% of North America's network traffic is now protected by SSL/TLS. To avoid impersonation attacks in SSL/TLS, users initiating an SSL/TLS communication are recommended to authenticate their communication peer to ensure they are interacting with the intended party and not an impostor. The X.509 public-key infrastructure (PKI) compensates for the Internet's inherent lack of trust by providing a cryptography-backed authentication framework in which entities are organized hierarchically based on trust, and each entity can obtain a certificate confirming its identity. While there is open-source software that implements the X.509 prescribed authentication checks, bugs in this software can leave users vulnerable to impersonation attacks. The X.509 open-source standard implementations, unlike SSL/TLS, have escaped rigorous security evaluations despite the fact that the security of SSL/TLS critically hinges on a correct X.509 implementation. This project seeks to reduce the attack surface of SSL/TLS and other applications that use X.509 as the authentication provider by developing an automatic technique for detecting logical bugs in X.509 implementations. <br/><br/>This project will take advantage of the insight that a given X.509 implementation partitions the certificate input universe into accepting (certificates considered valid by the implementation) and rejecting (certificates considered invalid) universes. One can use symbolic execution to automatically extract an approximation of the two universes from a given X.509 implementation and represent them with logical formulas. The project then aims to precisely capture the X.509 standard specification in some formal logic and also develop a reference implementation of the X.509 standard. To prove the compliance of the reference implementation against the formal specification, the research will leverage a combination of model checking and deductive verification techniques. With the provably correct reference implementation, say R, at hand, it will be possible to detect logical bugs and inconsistencies in a given X.509 implementation, T, by checking whether T deviates from R. Deviations will be efficiently calculated by comparing the certificate universes of R and T. In addition to its research impact, the techniques and research findings of this project will have a positive impact on the training of the future generation of computer security professionals."

Plastics are used in a vast range of products for their excellent properties including high strength to weight ratio, chemical resistance, and durability. Plastics are made of organic polymers, long molecules composed of many repeating units, whose structure and chemistry dictate the material properties. At the nanoscale, semi-crystalline polymers are composed of a mixture of regions in which long molecular chains are either highly ordered or disordered. The significantly different mechanical properties of these different phases can, when combined, lead to remarkably tough and stiff materials. Over the past decades, costly empirical efforts have been predominantly employed to progressively search for improved chemistries and material processing in order to create stronger and tougher plastics. Accurate and efficient simulation methods are needed to replace these empirical efforts, a critical step in shortening today?s 10-20 year materials development cycle. Therefore, results from this research will foster new innovation in plastics manufacturing, one of the few U.S. manufacturing sectors with a trade surplus, ultimately benefiting the U.S. economy and society.  Furthermore, the integration of educational and outreach activities with this research effort will help to address national challenges in meeting future demands for an abundant, diverse, and talented engineering workforce. For example, efficient learning will be facilitated through an adaptive and intelligent web-based educational system and cooperative learning, the latter of which will also be used to identify mentors for focused high school student workshops. <br/><br/>Coarse-grained molecular models are limited in the extent to which they can describe polymer mechanics due to well-known problems of representability and transferability.  Furthermore, their usage has been typically limited to simulations of single phase materials such as polymer melts or polymer glasses.

The research team will develop and train coarse-grained models, and conduct verification and validation of the models to ensure that the spectrum of relaxation timescales is preserved across the coarse-grained transformation. The team will also exercise the newly developed models to identify relationships between interphase structure and mechanical properties such as slip resistance."

The emphasis of the conference will be on recent spectacular developments in the theory of Drinfeld moduli spaces, Drinfeld modular forms, and their applications. It is hoped that having at the same place and time a large number of researchers  with different viewpoints on function field arithmetic will illuminate previously unnoticed connections within the area, thus facilitating future progress.

Over the last few years, there has been an explosion of activity in function field arithmetic, with many spectacular results on special values of higher derivatives of L-functions of automorphic forms, special values of Carlitz-Goss L-functions, and Drinfeld modular forms. Moreover, new tantalizing connections have been discovered between different topics of function field arithmetic, such as special values of characteristic p zeta functions, deformations of Drinfeld modular forms, and function field analogue of Fontaine's theory. In many of these works, Drinfeld moduli spaces play a prominent role. <br/>These developments, along with possible future directions of research, will be addressed by the invited speakers of this conference with the hope to inspire new generations to take part in this important and very active area of Number Theory. <br/><br/>Conference website: http://wwwmath.uni-muenster.de/sfb878/activities/AFF_announce.html"

In order to create a temporally- and spatially-resolved faunal dataset reflecting shifting ecological relationships, the three fossiliferous bulk sample sequences will be correlated to each other and to recognized geologic events using multiple chronostratigraphic methods. Paleoecological niche modeling will be used to test the concept of escalation in this predator-prey system, thus allowing for an evaluation of the role of both intrinsic and extrinsic factors in ecological function and health.

This research proposes to develop a new, widely applicable approach to identifying species using ground beetles (genus Bembidion) as a model. Preliminary data show that species in this group can have large differences in some aspects of the structure of their genomes despite being very closely related. These differences in genome structure are revealed by examining a set of genes (ribosomal DNA (rDNA) genes) with modern sequencing techniques. This analysis of 'rDNA fingerprints' costs little to obtain and has potential to help discover new species more efficiently than more traditionally used methods. Results from this research will be used for training opportunities for undergraduate students, as well as a community outreach project involving high school students. <br/><br/>The use of rDNA fingerprints as a species delimitation tool will be validated by profiling additional specimens through low-coverage Illumina sequencing and comparing patterns in rDNA fingerprints to existing species concepts that are built on five gene trees and morphological analysis. The extent of variation in rDNA fingerprints across a wider group of carabid beetles will be explored using a real-time PCR assay followed by additional sequencing of relevant specimens. Finally, the mechanism of copy number inflation within the rDNA cistron will be explored through comparative fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), to test the hypothesis that many copies of fragments of rDNA have been transferred to heterochromatic DNA near its boundary with euchromatin."

An efficient way to ensure that all jurisdictions have access to highly trained child interviewers is to conduct remote (live-streaming video) forensic interviews.  Remote interviewing could reduce investigative response time, spare investigative resources, and accelerate case disposition.  However, the ability of remote interviewing to elicit eyewitness evidence from children has not been sufficiently tested and, therefore, will certainly prompt challenges regarding children?s testimonial reliability.  The current project is a comprehensive and theoretically grounded evaluation of the effectiveness of remote interviewing of child witnesses.  Results will be disseminated to scientists and forensic professionals through publications and presentations, thereby informing policies and guidelines for the use of remote forensic interviews with children.  Because remote interviewing increases access to specialized expertise, project results will also impact how children are questioned by electronic means in non-forensic contexts.  The project will provide research training to dozens of students at two research sites and promote greater awareness of evidence-based practice through outreach to practitioners who work with child witnesses. <br/><br/>Using an established paradigm that produces salient touching experiences, individual children at two sites (ages 4 to 8 years) will be told that a male assistant can no longer touch their skin when he delivers a germ education program.  The assistant will touch each child once and realize an impending mistake before he completes a second touch.  Afterward, children will hear a story from their parents that contains misinformation about the experience, including narrative about a nonexperienced touch.  During interviews conducted in traditional face-to-face or remote formats, children will answer questions about the germ education event and answer a series of questions that tests their ability to distinguish experienced from suggested events.

It also seeks to determine how societies, economies and biophysical systems can be managed to ensure resilience; that is, how to maintain the capacity of a system to absorb disturbance. There are strong overlaps between the scientific discipline of geomorphology (the biophysical processes that shape Earth's landscapes) and the concept of resilience. There is however a lack of awareness of the foundations of the former in the emergence of resilience. Thus, resilience is limited and limiting in its application to bio-geomorphic systems. A collective examination of bio-geomorphic systems and resilience will conceptually advance both areas of study and further cement the relevance and importance of understanding the complexities of bio-geomorphic systems in an emerging world of interdisciplinary research endeavors. <br/><br/>The 48th annual Binghamton Geomorphology Symposium (BGS) on Resilience and Bio-Geomorphic Systems will bring together leading and emerging scientists in bio-geomorphology and resilience thinking.

An efficient way to ensure that all jurisdictions have access to highly trained child interviewers is to conduct remote (live-streaming video) forensic interviews.  Remote interviewing could reduce investigative response time, spare investigative resources, and accelerate case disposition.  However, the ability of remote interviewing to elicit eyewitness evidence from children has not been sufficiently tested and, therefore, will certainly prompt challenges regarding children?s testimonial reliability.  The current project is a comprehensive and theoretically grounded evaluation of the effectiveness of remote interviewing of child witnesses.  Results will be disseminated to scientists and forensic professionals through publications and presentations, thereby informing policies and guidelines for the use of remote forensic interviews with children.  Because remote interviewing increases access to specialized expertise, project results will also impact how children are questioned by electronic means in non-forensic contexts.  The project will provide research training to dozens of students at two research sites and promote greater awareness of evidence-based practice through outreach to practitioners who work with child witnesses. <br/><br/>Using an established paradigm that produces salient touching experiences, individual children at two sites (ages 4 to 8 years) will be told that a male assistant can no longer touch their skin when he delivers a germ education program.  The assistant will touch each child once and realize an impending mistake before he completes a second touch.  Afterward, children will hear a story from their parents that contains misinformation about the experience, including narrative about a nonexperienced touch.  During interviews conducted in traditional face-to-face or remote formats, children will answer questions about the germ education event and answer a series of questions that tests their ability to distinguish experienced from suggested events.  By comparing the completeness and accuracy of children?s testimonies across formats, this study will determine whether remote interviewing elicits testimony that is comparable in quality to the testimony elicited by face-to-face interviewing.

However, the nature of these changes and how they initiate responses in the plant remains unknown.  This project will address this issue with an international interdisciplinary approach, involving three investigators and twelve undergraduate students from Xavier University over the span of three years.  Four students will perform research each summer at the Universite Pierre et Marie Curie in Paris, France where they will grow and characterize an exhaustive collection of cryptochrome variants. Subsequently, the PI and students will use biophysical technology to obtain information on changes in shape of cryptochromes that are biologically relevant.  Using this interdisciplinary approach including biochemistry, photobiology, and biophysics, the structural basis of biological activity can be determined for one of the key receptors involved in the adaptation of plant life to the environment.<br/><br/>A key aim of this work is to provide undergraduate students with meaningful, cutting edge research opportunities, combined with international experience. These opportunities will excite and increase the numbers of students interested in STEM research, and give them the international experience needed to take a competitive, leadership position in the global research environment of the future in yet to be discovered interdisciplinary fields.  Minority students and women will be specifically targeted for this experience.  A further societal benefit from the study of cryptochromes is the possibility of novel interventions in both ecosystems and agricultural plants which may provide protection against economic and health effects of global climate change."

In such a system, a geo-location database administrator (DBA) accepts registrations from primary users and determines spectrum availability, and secondary users are all required to inquire the DBA about the availability of any interested spectrum before using it. An effective approach to improve the spectrum-estimation accuracy in database-driven DSS systems is to deploy a small number of dedicated spectrum sensors at strategic locations and outsource most spectrum-sensing tasks to ubiquitous mobile users. This approach is not only highly feasible given the wide penetration of increasingly powerful mobile devices into everyday life and the foreseeable prevalence of DSS in future mobile communication systems, but also expected to be much more cost-effective than deploying a large-scale network of dedicated distributed spectrum sensors. <br/><br/>This project is to investigate several fundamental security and privacy challenges associated with database-driven DSS systems armed with spectrum-sensing outsourcing. Specifically, there are four main thrusts in this project: (1) secure radio environment map construction in the presence of false spectrum measurements; (2) incentive-compatible and differentially-private mechanisms for crowdsourced spectrum sensing; (3) physical-layer secondary user authentication techniques for spectrum misuse detection; and (4) performance evaluation through a combination of measurement campaign, simulation study, prototyping, and experimentation.

Due to the prevalence of these new services, today's wireless networks are witnessing not only an unprecedented growth in the volume of traffic, but also a significant change in the types of traffic (e.g., a much higher percentage of voice/video traffic with more stringent delay requirements). These new trends require next-generation wireless networks to provide not only high data rates (tens of gigabits per second), but also ultra-low latencies (sub-millisecond). Moreover, as wireless networks grow and support an increasingly large number of users, network control algorithms must also incur low complexity in order to be implemented in practice. However, the question of how to simultaneously achieve high throughput, low delay and low complexity remains largely open. Addressing this major research challenge is a main goal of this project. Not only is this research expected to substantially advance our understanding of designing efficient control algorithms for wireless networks with jointly optimized performance, but it would also expand/create the much-needed theoretical foundations for developing simple and practical protocols to optimize the key performance metrics needed in the design of next-generation wireless networks. This research will also be closely integrated with a comprehensive educational plan, which is focused on providing research experiences to undergraduate and K-12 students, recruiting and training underrepresented students, and engaging in curriculum development activities. <br/><br/>The goal of this project is to create new theoretical foundations for designing provably efficient network control algorithms that perform well in all three dimensions of throughput, delay, and complexity.

Change has been targeted at the course and curriculum levels, focusing on teaching and learning methods and proving their efficacy. While beneficial, these activities have not fostered the strategies - such as motivation, communication, collaboration, and persuasion - that are necessary if individuals wish to enact change on larger, more institutional levels. These change strategies are well documented in the literature of other disciplines, such as organizational psychology and behavior, but have not been brought into the conversation within STEM education in a rigorous, accessible way. The workshop Making Academic Change Happen (MACH) fills the need of academics for research-based skills development and assistance in creating a plan for change. Through targeted working sessions on specific topics (e.g. partnership development, generating buy-in, institutional context, and identity discovery), participants learn research-proven strategies for making large scale change happen on their home campus. The focus group for the 2017 MACH Workshop is emerging engineering educators. The primary experience of graduate training is to be introduced to disciplinary research and then be provided with a means to gain further competence. We have determined, however, that new engineering educators are tasked with developing new courses, curricula, and programs.  These initiatives require additional skills or areas of expertise: advising, mentoring, curriculum development, imaginative vision, program assessment, etc. None of these skills are likely addressed in a typical engineering Ph.D. curriculum. For these reasons, we believe that new engineering educators who envision themselves as change agents should work to adopt the disposition and skills of a change agent.  Attending the MACH Workshop will help these educators start on their path as engineering education innovators.<br/><br/>The purpose of this workshop is to assist emerging engineering educators in: 1) learning and practicing skills needed to lead change, and 2) preparing working documents around a variety of topics that are necessary to advance a change project. By fostering the development of these skills and mindsets in the very people who must lead change efforts, this workshop promotes meaningful change in STEM higher education. The change projects advanced by the workshop participants are expected to become model programs that can be mined for examples strategies and processes for others hoping to implement similar ideas. These projects reach beyond a single classroom, focusing more on the underlying processes, approaches, or philosophy of STEM education enacted on their campus. By working within the institution's context, the change agents trained during the MACH Workshop will positively impact the student experience of STEM.  As part of this research, the emerging engineering educators will be interviewed about their change projects and provided with mentors and support for their change activities. Mentorship will continue to be offered after the workshop is over. The progress on their change projects will also be tracked as they implement the MACH change strategies they learned during the workshop."

Optimizing the balance between the acute risk posed by pathogens and the chronic risk posed by disinfection by-products is becoming more challenging as utilities experiment with new disinfectant combinations and exploit impaired waters. The 2017 Gordon Research Conference on Drinking Water Disinfection By-Products (DBPs) will present cutting-edge research to address this challenge from the fields of engineering, chemistry, toxicology, epidemiology and regulatory policy. The 2017 meeting, entitled Disinfection 2100: Linking Engineering, Chemistry, Toxicology, and Epidemiology to Reduce Exposure to Toxicity Drivers While Curtailing Pathogens, will take place from July 30-August 4, 2017 at Mt. Holyoke College in South Hadley, MA.<br/><br/>The conference has two main goals. The first goal is to broaden the scope beyond DBP formation within conventional drinking water plants. The first two sessions will directly address the balance between the acute risk associated with pathogens and the chronic risk linked to DBPs. The first session will evaluate disinfectant reactions with pathogens, recognizing that the biomolecular transformations responsible for pathogen kill are DBPs. The second session will cover tradeoffs between microbial growth and DBPs within distribution systems, the least evaluated sector of drinking water systems. The sixth section will focus on DBPs in wastewater recycling, particularly which DBPs contribute most to toxicity and how to control them. The conference will also include new arenas for DBPs, including the formation of DBPs during food processing. The second goal is to move towards a solution to the DBP problem. A major strength of this conference is that it brings together engineers, chemists, toxicologists, epidemiologists and regulators, the key players for addressing this problem. Previous conferences have concluded that there is no feasible way to control pathogens without producing DBPs, so the challenge is to achieve the best balance that minimizes exposure to the DBPs driving risk. Sessions will link chemistry and toxicology to identify these toxicity drivers. Session 8 will feature discussions among chemists, exposure experts and epidemiologists about how the ideal epidemiology study should be designed to provide the evidence to link exposure to human health risks. Session 9 will conclude with presentations and a discussion regarding how to design water treatment systems that minimize toxicity drivers, including a presentation from a Dutch utility on how to avoid the use of disinfectants in drinking water distribution systems. With US utilities currently modifying their disinfection schemes and exploiting impaired water supplies, it is important for experts in engineering, chemistry, toxicology, epidemiology and regulatory policy to discuss the risk balance between pathogens and DBPs resulting from these new practices. The 4.5-day Gordon Research Conference format, with lengthy discussion periods and ample provision for informal discussions and social interactions, is particularly suited to promoting the needed multidisciplinary approach. The Conference will be preceded by a 1.5-day Gordon Research Seminar (GRS), organized by early career scientists. The GRS will feature presentations by graduate students and postdoctoral fellows, and a career mentoring panel by established academic, government and industrial scientists. Gordon Conferences are often considered the pre-eminent conferences in their fields. By highlighting emerging researchers as presenters in the GRC and encouraging the development of young scientists through the GRS, this conference will help lay a solid foundation for multidisciplinary research for the next generation of scientists."

Understanding how organisms cope physiologically with naturally variable environments will be important for predicting organismal responses, including those in humans, to increasingly unpredictable environments characterized by frequent extreme weather events like droughts and floods. And since coping mechanisms themselves, short-term physiological and behavioral responses, respond to environmental variation over longer time periods, a comparative approach is needed to fully understand how organisms have historically responded to climatic uncertainty. To determine how vertebrates adapt to and cope with environmental variation at the physiological and molecular level, this study will simultaneously explore patterns of genetic and epigenetic variation in genes of birds that underlie the stress response and the entire genome across an ecological gradient in Kenya, and then relate this variation to patterns of gene expression in naturally variable and experimentally-controlled climates. This study will train high school students, undergraduates, and graduate students, particularly those from underrepresented groups, in the field and lab. Training will emphasize cutting-edge, integrative tools that are transferable across disciplines. Researchers will work closely with a grassroots Kenyan conservation organization to educate rural schoolchildren on conservation and wildlife through a series of teaching modules and public representations. Finally, researchers will present the results of their work locally around New York City and in popular articles aimed at a diverse audience.<br/><br/>One of the primary ways that vertebrates cope physiologically with environmental variability is through changes in the hypothalamo-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis, the neuroendocrine system that controls reactions to stress. The HPA axis encompasses a cascade of hormones, receptors, and other molecules, each of which may respond to different types and timescales of environmental variation. Although understanding how the HPA axis responds to environmental variability is important for determining how organisms will cope with environmental uncertainty because it is one of the first ways that vertebrates respond to environmental stressors, many other physiological, endocrine, and molecular pathways are also impacted by environmental stressors. Therefore, a genome-wide approach that links molecular mechanisms and adaptive genetic and epigenetic variation more broadly to physiological function will be necessary to understand how animals adapt to and cope with environmental uncertainty. The objective of this study is to determine how environmental variation influences adaptive genetic (DNA sequence) and epigenetic variation (DNA methylation), gene function (mRNA expression), and physiological responses (hormone activity) to shape particular phenotypes in populations of free-living superb starlings (Lamprotornis superbus) sampled across a broad-scale ecological gradient in sub-Saharan Africa encompassing some of the most unpredictable climatic zones in the world. Building upon long-term data in African starlings, and using a series of newly-established populations along an ecological gradient in Kenya, this work will allow researchers to begin to understand how environmentally-induced selection pressures shape the molecular mechanisms, adaptive evolutionary responses, and coping strategies that vertebrates use to live with environmental uncertainty."

To address this critical need, the proposed work seeks to generate mini-brains (also called brain organoids) with defined structure and function that would mimic human brains. To achieve this, this project will utilize stem cell-based tissue engineering approach, leveraging the capability of stem cells to self-assemble into brain-like structure under suitable conditions. The proposed research provides a new approach for the understanding of brain tissue development, and a practical and clinically relevant platform for drug discovery and screening. Specifically, this project will generate and characterize homotypic and heterotypic brain-region-specific organoids derived from human stem cells; investigate the influence of extracellular matrix composition and remodeling on the formation of brain-like organoids; and, pattern brain tissue along rostral and caudal axis by modulating the Wnt signaling pathway.  The novelty of the proposed research is that additional cell types are incorporated with induced pluripotent stem cell-derived neural spheroids and the extracellular matrices containing signaling molecules such as in Wnt pathway are provided to mimic spatial regulations that occur in human brain. In addition, the project will establish an interactive learning platform to form a bridge between academia and industry, while simultaneously reducing gender disparity and increasing the participation of minority students in engineering.  The project will encourage African American and female students to pursue advanced career by recruiting them to participate in the proposed research and education. A broader goal of the proposed work is to establish a stem cell engineering research and education program that will attract underrepresented students for integrated multidisciplinary research and education. The education and outreach plan will accomplish the educational objectives by:  establishing mentoring and research projects to attract female and minority students, enhancing Active Learning through Stem cell/Organoid engineering (ALSO) and digital platforms, and building an academia-industry pipeline to supply next-generation bioengineers."

Conifers have an intriguing paradox in the link between their leaf anatomy and physiology: with such a simplistic, single-vein vascular system, how can they compete with broadleaf species or inhabit extreme environments? This project aims to understand how conifer leaf anatomy influences water transport and photosynthesis, and how needle water transport declines during drought. This information will then be used to develop a mechanistic model to help predict forest productivity and mortality in response to drought and other environmental challenges. The project will provide training for a postdoctoral researcher, a graduate student, and multiple undergraduate students. Also, in collaboration with the McCall Outdoor Science School, 5th and 6th grade students, their parents and teachers will participate in a workshop called ""What happens inside a leaf?"" To illustrate how cellular-level modifications can influence landscape processes, 3D-printed conifer needle models generated from X-ray imaging will be used. Anatomical models will be freely available through a website for teachers and students to 3D print hand-held models at schools, or as teaching kits for schools without access to 3D printing technology. <br/><br/>Conifers inhabit some of the driest and coldest habitats where trees are found.  Many conifer species are threatened by heat waves and droughts that induce physiological stress that can make them more vulnerable to pests and pathogens. Although most conifer leaves have only a single vein supplying water to the leaf, the internal anatomy outside the vein is incredibly diverse across the conifer phylogeny. The impact of this diversity on water transport and carbon uptake is unknown. The primary goal of this project is to develop a mechanistic framework to understand the influence of conifer leaf anatomy on leaf hydraulic conductance and photosynthetic capacity. This mechanistic understanding will be used to illuminate how conifers have adapted to arid and cold environments and have also been able to successfully compete with angiosperm species over evolutionary history. The project will combine state-of the art 3-dimensional imaging methods (high-resolution X-ray computed micro-tomography) with a hydraulic model and measurement of leaf hydraulic conductance to clarify the impact of conifer leaf internal anatomy on hydraulic function."

The PI will focus on the mechanisms of toxic metal release in diverse water chemistries. One goal is to create a new paradigm in managing drinking water and provide essential insights for the safety of water treatment applications. Reaching this goal will require the integration of fundamental principles of corrosion, chemistry, and kinetics modeling with the development of advanced tools in electrochemistry.

The central research hypothesis is that in situ release of accumulated inorganic contaminants from the drinking water distribution infrastructure is closely associated with the redox behavior of these contaminants. Solution chemical conditions can be optimized to control their mobility. In this project the PI will investigate 1) the redox-driven release of chromium, arsenic, selenium, and vanadium mediated by different residual disinfectants in the distribution systems; 2) quantify catalytic and inhibitive effects of solution chemical conditions and changing water sources on the rates of inorganic contaminant release; and 3) examine the nature of short-lived metal intermediates that control the ultimate yields of inorganic contaminants in water distribution systems. Research themes will be integrated into systematically assessed educational initiatives that will 1) increase four-year university enrollment for underrepresented students in Inland Southern California; 2) cultivate a creative and globally engaged workforce in environmental engineering; and 3) inform the water industry and the public about water distribution system issues. The PI will integrate the research with educational outreach opportunities for two PhD students, hundreds of undergraduates, community college students, K-12 teachers, water utility managers, and the residents of Inland Southern California.

To realize the goal of understanding processes at interfaces between liquids and solids, processes that for example determine how batteries function and how they fail, the objective of this project is to develop and apply novel electron microscopy techniques that allow not only solid/solid, but also liquid/solid and soft/hard interfaces to be studied at the nanometer to atomic scale. This project will have an impact on science and technology by providing high-resolution characterization techniques of materials that are of interest for a wide range of technologies thereby promoting the progress of sciences, materials discovery and applications. The project will also provide stimulating and authentic experiences for freshmen, K-12 students and teachers with the goal of motivating a new generation of scientists. Microscopy will play a central role in these efforts, which include the development of a freshman laboratory module and a microscopy-based science kit for K-12 teachers nationwide. <br/><br/>Technical summary: Recent advances in electron microscopy have opened a new era of atomic resolution imaging and spectroscopy inside solids. Liquid/solid interfaces have yet to be imaged at high spatial resolution but play a critical role in a range of biological, chemical and physical processes from catalysis to electrochemical energy storage to the formation of biominerals. Inspired by electron microscopy of biological systems, with this CAREER award, the PI develops new sample preparation techniques that use rapid freezing to stabilize the soft and liquid components of composite systems in a vitreous state enabling structural and spectroscopic studies by cryo-STEM. Materials that are sufficiently thin for direct analysis in the microscope such as nanostructured electrode materials in liquid electrolytes, the crystal structure and defects of the inorganic crystalline components and the surrounding liquid will be simultaneously imaged. For thicker samples, including lithium-metal batteries, cryo-focused ion beam lift-out will be developed to gain access to the internal liquid/solid interfaces. This characterization platform will be used to study the early stages of dendrite formation at lithium-metal/electrolyte interfaces to gain a fundamental understanding of the mechanisms governing their formation and growth. The ability to identify nucleation sites for dendritic growth will shed new light on a central challenge in developing high-energy rechargeable metal batteries.<br/>With the goal of creating a broader, more diverse workforce, this project focuses on attracting and recruiting students into the fields of science, technology, engineering and mathematics at an earlier stage. K-12 teacher development is supported through MicroWorld, a microscopy-based module that will be adapted to meet the challenges of the Next Generation Science Standards. This module will benefit teacher workshops for K-12 teachers who work in minority-serving schools and will also be made available to teachers nationwide through the CCMR Lending Library of Experiments. Freshmen will benefit from the development of FLAME, a new Freshman Lab on Advanced Microscopy with Electrons. This project will therefore impact science, technology, engineering and mathematics education, both at the K-12 and the college level.<br/>"

Residents of cities with poor sanitation are exposed to a range of pathogens via a number of pathways, contributing to a high burden of disease. One pathway that has not yet been adequately characterized in these settings is the aeromicrobiological (AMB) pathway: the transport of pathogens in aerosols where uncontained fecal waste exists in close proximity to population centers. In this project the PI aims to advance our understanding of the role bioaerosols play in transmission of pathogens in these environments. Findings will be applicable to many settings in the US and other developed countries as well; these settings include areas of intensive animal agriculture, wastewater infrastructure, and biosolids management. Field studies will be integrated with innovative, hands-on, undergraduate engineering courses focused on environmental problems affecting global public health in underserved communities.<br/><br/>The PI seeks to determine whether bioaerosols represent a source of persistent exposure to enteric pathogens in cities with poor sanitation.  The objectives of a series of studies are to determine: (i) the prevalence, concentration, and potential viability of important human enteric pathogens in air samples from three cities in the developing world representing a range of conditions, across seasons and multiple years, via culture-dependent and culture-independent methods; (ii) particle size and source apportionment of aerosols containing enteric pathogens to develop models for transport and exposure; (iii) environmental and built environment variables that may be associated with the presence, concentration, and viability of these pathogens, including season, temperature and relative humidity, rainfall events, localized population density, and proximity to uncontained fecal wastes; and (iv) infection risks associated with potential exposures to pathogens through the AMB pathway, via quantitative microbial risk assessment (QMRA).

The goal of this research is to reveal the fundamental reactivity rules of common organometallic intermediates in these transformations and to develop new models to interpret ligand effects on reactivity and selectivity. This project's educational and outreach plan aims to maximize the power of computations to enhance learning of organic chemistry concepts and to facilitate synthetic organic chemistry research. Professor Liu's team develops virtual reality (VR) software and educational materials to visualize three-dimensional molecular structures and reaction mechanism videos in an interactive and immersive environment.  The VR software and its educational modules are released to undergraduate organic chemistry students and the general public free of charge through Android and Apple app stores. This new technology may transform the way organic molecules and reactions are presented to non-experts and create a more effective approach to advance understanding of organic chemistry concepts.<br/><br/>This project aims to address two basic challenges in performing computational studies on transition metal catalysts: 1) the lack of mechanistic understandings in many recently developed catalytic systems, and 2) the complexities in analyzing and rationalizing computational data, in particular, the origin of ligand effects. The research investigates novel reaction pathways involving the activated organometallic intermediates formed after the C-H and C-C bond cleavage steps, and elucidates the effects of ligands, directing groups, substituents, ring strain, and norbornene and Lewis acid co-catalysts. To systematically characterize the origin of ligand effects on reactivity and selectivity, a ligand-substrate interaction model is developed. This model uses energy decomposition analysis (EDA) methods to dissect the through-space ligand-substrate interactions into chemically meaningful terms, including steric repulsion, polarization, charge transfer, and dispersion. The insights obtained from the proposed ligand-substrate interaction model are used to develop of a catalyst screening methodology for transition metal catalysts.  In addition, this project establishes a platform for synthetic chemistry researchers to learn and use computational tools to support their scientific research. A spectrum of activities,<br/>including curriculum and training materials development, collaboration and student exchange, and summer research programs that target undergraduate underrepresented minority students, are incorporated in the platform. A discovery-based computational chemistry course for students with synthetic organic backgrounds is developed to provide an interdisciplinary training at the interface of organic and computational chemistry. The straightforward computational models, software tools, principles of reactivity, and the online ligand database resulting from the research activities facilitate the use of computational tools by synthetic organic chemists."

It is often assumed that chlorine enters non-contaminated ecosystems mostly in the form of chloride (the same negative ion in table salt), and that chloride does not interact with plants or soil microorganisms. However, there is growing evidence that chloride is taken up and transformed by plants and soil microorganisms into complex chlorine-containing organic compounds. In environments where oxygen is scarce, some bacteria can use these chlorinated organic compounds instead of oxygen in a form of anaerobic respiration called organohalide respiration (OHR). In this way, these bacteria can quickly use up energy sources that would otherwise be used to produce methane. This means that an active biological chlorine cycle could reduce the amount of methane that is released into the atmosphere. Methane is a strong greenhouse gas, trapping about 30 times as much heat per molecule as carbon dioxide. The Arctic region has been warming faster than the rest of the planet, and large amounts of organic carbon are stored in Arctic soils. It is thus important to understand how much soil carbon will be lost to the atmosphere in the form of carbon dioxide or methane, since these two gases have different effects on the climate the climate system. This project measures rates of biological chlorine cycling in locations across the Arctic Coastal Plain of northern Alaska, and tests whether organohalide respiration does in fact significantly reduces methane production in these areas. This project could inform models of greenhouse gas emissions, improve understanding of the fate of chlorinated contaminants in Arctic soils, and further the basic science of biological chlorine cycling. The project will involve students at a minority-serving institution (San Diego State University) and a high school teacher, who will lead broader outreach and education efforts.<br/><br/>The proposed research addresses the following two questions: (1) Does OHR inhibit methanogenesis via competition for H2? (2) How does the relative magnitude of Cl cycling and its relationship to CH4 flux change along a coastal-inland gradient in the Arctic Coastal Plain? The experimental approach consists of a field survey that compares CH4 fluxes and indicators of Cl cycling along a gradient of coastal influence from Barrow to the foothills of the Brooks Range, and a laboratory incubation experiment to study the relationships among OHR, methanogenesis, other terminal electron acceptor processes, and H2 availability. Indicators of Cl cycling include sizes and transformation rates of soil Cl pools, metagenomes describing the relative abundance of genes and microbial taxa associated with Cl cycling and other anaerobic processes, and 37Cl and 36Cl isotopic analysis to infer the dominant Cl cycling processes and to constrain long-term cycling rates. The laboratory incubation will follow anaerobic processes (OHR, iron reduction, methanogenesis, acetogenesis, and sulfate reduction) in microcosms varying in Clorg and H2 concentration to establish the thermodynamic hierarchy among these processes and whether competition is alleviated by increased H2."

Maintaining the CPRs, their internal mechanisms, and the preparation of the silks is an important part of the work of the survey. Samples cut from the silk that represent ~10 nautical miles are analysed under a microscope and the species identified, all to standard procedures.  In the analysis, the color of the silks is assessed visually to a standard scale as the ""Phytoplankton Color Index"".  The data will be used to describe the long-term, pelagic variability and diversity of plankton in the NW Atlantic and will help scientists interpret marine biological changes and to distinguish between anthropogenic, climatically forced, and natural plankton variability.  The analysis of the CPR data will be directed to incorporate marine management issues and include studies on: large-scale environmental change; biodiversity and invasive species; sustainable use of marine bio-resources; ecosystem health and ocean acidification. All these themes are highly relevant to emerging scientific questions, US marine policy and management interests, and the main societal concerns on the marine environment.  Throughout the duration of the project it is envisaged that the data collected will provide invaluable information in addressing these highly topical themes and understanding these impacts on the marine ecosystems of the NW Atlantic."

The specific questions to be addressed include the following. How are new technologies for sharing, organizing, and analyzing data and theories changing the norms of evidence in neuroimaging research? How are these technologies bringing research communities, theories, data, and analysis techniques together in novel ways? What role do different data analysis techniques play in using data as evidence for claims about phenomena it was not produced to investigate? How does the use of new technologies change the way cognitive scientists interpret their data? The postdoctoral fellow will engage in participatory experience in the practice of neuroscience to obtain valuable insight into the use and structure of these technologies, which will then be used to address these philosophical questions. More specifically, the fellow will be situated in a neuroscience lab that uses and develops tools such as the Cognitive Atlas, a community driven-knowledge base, and OpenfMRI, a database of minimally processed neuroimaging data. The postdoc will contribute to ongoing research using these tools. He will gain participatory experience regarding their use and development, and while doing so engage in philosophical analysis to addresses his questions. The analysis will in turn serve to enhance the use and development of these technologies, as well as the practice of neuroscience. By situating the fellow, a philosopher of science, within the active community of cognitive neuroscientists, the project will provide members of that community with cross-disciplinary expertise. More broadly, the project will demonstrate the value of engaged philosophy of neuroscience for both advancing the practice of neuroscience, and improving the richness and quality of philosophical analyses that take neuroscience to be its subject.<br/><br/>Technical Summary     <br/><br/>The proposed research project is focused on addressing philosophical issues in the epistemology of science, by approaching them from the perspective of the practices that give rise these issues. Over the last decade, neuroimaging research has involved new technologies and tools for sharing, organizing, and analyzing data and theories. This has gone hand in hand with two movements in cognitive neuroscience. The first is the growing pressure to make research practices reproducible and transparent, with the aim of improving the standards of evidence and quality of research. The second is the realization that newly developed analysis techniques that could be used to investigate hypotheses and theories previously beyond the scope of available evidence require large collections of organized and annotated data to produce meaningful results. The proposed project involves simultaneously engaging in the practice of using these technologies and studying how they are changing the evidential and theoretical landscape of cognitive neuroscience. The research fellow will use philosophical concepts to evaluate the strength of scientific inferences and to identify assumptions implicit in aspects of the technology. For example, he will explore the relations between concepts allowed by the Cognitive Atlas or its use, such as the decisions that are made during the analysis of data. This application of philosophical frameworks will also provide feedback on their descriptive and normative adequacy. In this way, this project will contribute to philosophical discussions about the epistemology of data-intensive science and neuroscience, and bring insight from those contributions to bear on the use and development of technologies (such as the Cognitive Atlas)."

Likewise, computational and data generation workflows are often cobbled together, hard-coded, and not readily amenable for sharing.<br/><br/>These problems are addressed by the distributed RMACC cyberteam who will provide support for researchers in the region by assisting them with data and workflow reuse and management. The facilitators have complementary skills and expertise, and are fully integrated into campus and regional efforts. Their focus is on data curation and metadata, and data and compute workflows, including protected information. These facilitators, in collaboration with others in the region, provide and develop regional, shared resources to support data management for small research groups and under-resourced communities, including working with regional RMACC partners."

The researchers take methods from computer science and put them to work with tools and methods from speech science, linguistics and digital humanities to find out objectively how much the sounds of English dialects across the Atlantic vary now and in the past. Scholars across the humanities and social sciences already routinely analyze huge amounts of written English quickly and easily.  In fact, the electronic tools for searching texts and, within seconds, obtaining summaries that one can see are available to anyone. However, speech research is only now entering its own ""big data"" revolution. Past linguistic research tended to carry out detailed analyses of a few aspects of speech from one or a few languages or dialects. The current scale of speech research studies has shaped our understanding of spoken language and the kinds of questions that we ask. Today, massive digital collections of transcribed speech are available from many languages, gathered for numerous purposes: from oral histories to large datasets for training speech recognition systems to legal and political interactions. Sophisticated speech processing tools exist to analyze these data, but they require substantial technical skill. Combining these data and tools allows linguists to answer fundamental questions about the nature and development of spoken language. <br/><br/>This collaborative project seeks to establish the key tools to enable large-scale speech research to become as powerful and pervasive as large-scale text mining. This ability to quickly and easily analyze speech in many English dialects should be applicable in computational, forensic, and clinical approaches to speech, and forensic and clinical speech applications, and useful to literary scholars, sociologists, anthropologists, historians, political scientists. What is learned from this project will be shared with the public through an interactive sound mapping website.<br/><br/>This award was made as part of Round 4 of the Digging Into Data Challenge, an international funding opportunity designed to foster research collaboration across countries and to encourage innovative approaches to analyzing large data sets in the social sciences and humanities.

The calculation of real GDP per capita, which is made by the World Bank, is much the same as the calculation needed to obtain an extreme poverty line of $1.90 per day: both calculations must convert spending in a local currency into spending in U.S. dollars. Nominal exchange rates cannot be used for this purpose because they do not take into account the price levels existing in each country. In particular, converting the spending in developing countries into U.S. dollars with nominal exchange rates makes poor counties appear even poorer and rich countries even richer. Instead, it is essential to correct for the lower prices found in poor countries as compared to rich countries. <br/><br/>This project studies the feasibility of using ""Big Data"" methods and online prices to convert spending across countries into a common currency (U.S. dollars), and to establish extreme poverty lines in a common currency (e.g. $1.90 per day). The source of internet price data is the Billion Prices Project (BPP), an academic initiative associated with Alberto Cavallo, one of the principal investigators. The BPP has access to global price information at a very fine level of detail, as is essential in order to compare price for the same goods (e.g. Arabica coffee beans) across countries. These online prices have the potential to improve both the frequency and accuracy of price observations in comparison to traditional price data collection methods, For example, the World Bank currently engages in a labor-intensive collection of prices across countries in what is called the International Comparisons Project (ICP). Because it involves actual visits to stores in so many countries, the ICP can collect prices only at infrequent intervals (the most recent years were 2005 and 2011, with another collection planned for 2017). Furthermore, traditional data collection methods require the cooperation of local statistical agencies and their adherence to strict quality and methodological standards that are often impossible to control. The results will be valuable for the World Bank and other international agencies engaged in measuring real GDP and extreme poverty; for policy-makers that rely on accuracy of these measurements to design and implement solutions; for the work of academics engaged in the Penn World Tables and related international comparison databases; and for scholars from Economics, Political Science, and other disciplines who rely on the measurement of real GDP in various countries. <br/><br/>The main goals of this project are to: a) utilize ""Big Data"" internet sources from the Billion Prices Project to obtain a database of average online prices for comparable products across countries that is independent of the methods used to collect prices by the World Bank; b) to use this online price information to construct measures of the standard of living across countries that can be compared to those from the World Bank, but which will potentially differ due to the new sources of price data; and c) do this at a monthly frequency, rather than once every 6 years, to more accurately track and pinpoint changes in prices and living standards. Large-scale micro-price data from various sources (government surveys, scanner datasets, or web-scraped online sources) have become available for researchers in recent years, but they are not yet suited for comparing prices across countries because prices are not collected according to the same classification or identification system and use differing price collection methods can invalidate international comparisons. The approach will be to access the large-scale, multi-country dataset of prices available at the BPP, build a standardized method for matching products across countries, and develop an appropriate methodology to scale up from individual product prices to an overall consumer price comparison. The project will focus on key practical and methodological issues and lay the groundwork for the use of online price data in research applications that make cost-of-living comparisons across countries. The research will be published in academic papers and the researchers will also publish a monthly database of average price levels in various countries computed during the duration of the project. The investigators will share this database publicly with other researchers via data depositories such as the Harvard/MIT Dataverse. The website of the Penn World Table (www.ggdc.net/pwt) will also provide a platform for disseminating the results from integrating online price information with other macroeconomic data series.<br/><br/>This award was made as part of Round 4 of the Digging Into Data Challenge, an international funding opportunity designed to foster research collaboration across countries and to encourage innovative approaches to analyzing large data sets in the social sciences and humanities.

Understanding the social forces behind self-organized collaboration is increasingly important in today's society. Technological and social innovations are increasingly generated through informal, distributed collaboration processes, rather than in formal, hierarchical organizations. This project will use a data-driven approach to explore the social and psychological mechanisms that motivate self-organized collaborations and determine their likelihood of success or failure, focusing on the example of open, collaborative software development in online collaborative networks like GitHub (github.com). We offer a mathematically precise model for predicting and testing collaborative dynamics, which builds on a long tradition of sociological theory and research. By accounting for noise and uncertainty in processing social events, this work will make it possible to study the reach of social psychological mechanisms to forms of interaction other than face-to-face communication, where interpretations of events are far less certain, and to cross-cultural interactions.<br/><br/>The research builds on a powerful sociological theory of group processes known as affect control theory (ACT) and a recent probabilistic generalization of it, Bayesian affect control theory (BayesACT). BayesACT applies insights from Bayesian probability theory to explain how people learn and adjust meanings through social experience, and show how stable interaction dynamics emerge from individuals' uncertain and noisy perceptions of their own and others' identities. The model rests on the idea that humans are motivated in their social interactions by affective alignment: They strive for their social experiences to be coherent at a deep, emotional level with their sense of identity and the cultural beliefs they share with others. BayesACT makes explicit predictions about online interactions in a collaborative group, based on the notion that each group member holds an identity that is learnable, mathematically describable, and complementary to those of other group members. These predictions allow for deeper and more focused data mining, enabling the identification of interactions of specific types in order to answer questions about the very nature of collaboration within online collaborative networks. <br/><br/>The knowledge generated through this project will be widely disseminated online, and through professional presentations and publications. In addition, the project will provide training and mentoring for a postdoctoral fellow and a diverse group of undergraduate research assistants.

There are areas that do not have continuous access to clean drinking water from a public utility.  Often water treatment facilities are not able to easily remove organic contaminants from the water source before the disinfection step and distribution.  This technology potentially removes the molecular contaminants that lead to these harmful and regulated disinfection byproducts.  The largest commercial impact related to the technology is likely from removing contaminants from water during acute natural or anthropogenic events.  Drought or floods can increase contaminants into the natural water supply.  Extreme weather can also disrupt water supplies due to flooding, especially when waste water is discharged into the water supply.  Industrial accidents like petroleum spills, pipeline leaks, and coal ash pond breaches can disrupt the water supply of an entire city for weeks or longer.  The materials and processes developed here can be designed for these acute or emergency management events.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project demonstrates the development of a technology platform to remove molecular and ionic contaminant from natural waters and from treated water.  The technology outperforms current methods at removing the smallest molecules that seem to be the most recalcitrant and can be potentially harmful to human health.  The intellectual merit of this project centers upon this flexible platform of functionalized materials with controllable morphology.  Short oligomers are synthesized with specific functionality to adsorb various water contaminants.  These oligomers are functionalized to scaffolding materials and form a contact resin that adsorbs a high capacity of molecular species in a very rapid rate.  The ability to control the morphology of the scaffolding allows maintenance of the high surface area exposed to the contaminated water.  Moreover, the porosity is kept high enough to allow a fast-filtration method of water treatment."

Cyber-physical Systems technologies provide new opportunities to improve the energy efficiency of supermarket refrigerators, which also affect power and food supply chain systems, as these technologies allow us to optimize energy consumption and inventory level. However, optimizing refrigeration-energy-food supply chain systems presents challenges regarding: (a) imperfect product demand distributions, (b) security/privacy-preserving information exchanges, and (c) asymmetric information in a supply chain. This project addresses these challenges by developing new control and incentive tools, which also will benefit energy and food systems. <br/><br/>The methods being pursued will improve refrigeration-energy-food systems with contributions to the following fundamental areas. First, the project aims to establish a theoretical foundation of distributionally robust stochastic control methods given imperfect distributional information about disturbances. Second, the project plans to develop a hierarchical control approach that does not exchange any explicit state information between two layers of a hierarchy using convex envelopes. Third, the project aims to generalize the classical incentive contract or principal-agent theory in the two directions: (a) integrating engineering systems with nontrivial dynamics into contracts and (b) incentivizing a hierarchy of agents. <br/><br/>The proposed energy management system for supermarkets can provide ancillary services that support the penetration of intermittent wind and solar generation by ensuring sufficient grid balancing capacity. Furthermore, the proposed incentive contracts and data-sharing regulations can facilitate food supply chain coordination.

By establishing a new integrative approach to computational and data-driven HPS, the RCN will in turn facilitate an integration of HPS with big-data and data-driven science. In addition, the RCN will lead to new types of questions facilitated by this approach, and thereby increase the relevance of HPS for larger questions at the intersection between science and society. It will also facilitate international collaborations and the inclusion of a diverse group of scholars, particularly many younger scholars; it will do so by promoting commitment to open source, open access, and open education thereby providing broader access to and participation in the HPS community, including members of the general public.    <br/><br/>Without coordinated authorities and ontologies, data cannot be shared or integrated across individual projects, severely limiting their broader use. Without the benefits of such an economy of scale the transformative impact of computational methods in HPS is limited as the integration and computational analysis of datasets across multiple projects is precisely what enables novel and innovative questions. This RCN addresses the challenges related to authorities and ontologies for computational and digital projects in HPS by conducting research and developing computational solutions for mapping authorities and integrating ontologies across HPS projects through step-wise aggregation and mapping of data models, authorities and ontologies. The international RCN will (1) solidify a working social/organizational network of researchers in computational HPS, including a structured set of educational modules; (2) coordinate research and development of software solutions to address the challenge of data integration across HPS projects; and (3) document and analyze the process of reaching these solutions and integration as an example of how the computational turn affects the development of scientific fields."

Microlocal sheaf theory is the geometric formulation of microlocal analysis. Recent advances have uncovered striking applications of microlocal sheaf theory to symplectic geometry. This project will explore and extend these applications in various directions, including further developing algebraic and combinatorial connections between curves, knots, and surfaces.  In terms of education, the principal investigator will prepare much-needed elementary expository works on the subject of microlocal sheaf theory.<br/><br/>The specific research goals of the proposal are twofold. First, to localize the calculations of the Fukaya category of a Weinstein manifold (a certain sort of exact symplectic manifold) to its Lagrangian skeleton. Once localized, performing this calculation is a matter of combinatorics; thus secondly, the PI intends to explore the resulting combinatorics. It is already known that the sort of combinatorics that arises has a representation-theoretic flavor; in particular cluster algebras and categorified knot invariants appear. Further insights in these subjects will be gained by exploring their connection with symplectic geometry in terms of the above-mentioned skeleta. The localization and calculation of these Fukaya categories that are the focus of this research will play an essential role in an approach to the homological mirror symmetry conjecture."

Ethane is an abundant hydrocarbon in the atmosphere. The ice core samples that will be used in this analysis will span about 150 years before present to about 55,000 years before present and therefore, ethane emissions linked to human activities are not a subject of this study. The study will focus on quantifying the variability in the natural sources of ethane and the processes that govern its removal from the atmosphere. A long-term ice core ethane record will provide new knowledge on the chemistry of Earth?s atmosphere during time periods when human influence was either much smaller than present day or non-existent. The broader impacts of this work include education and training of students and a contribution to a better understanding of the chemistry of the atmosphere in the past and how it has been impacted by past changes in climate.<br/> <br/>Natural sources that emit ethane are both geologic (e.g. seeps, vents, mud volcanoes etc.) and pyrogenic (wild fires) which is commonly called biomass burning. Ethane is removed from the atmosphere via oxidation reactions. The ice core ethane measurements have great potential as a proxy for gaseous emissions from biomass burning. This is especially true for time periods preceding the industrial revolution when atmospheric variability of trace gases was largely controlled by natural processes. Another objective of this study is to improve understanding of the causes of atmospheric methane variability apparent which are in the existing ice core records. Methane is a simpler hydrocarbon than ethane and more abundant in the atmosphere. Even though the project does not include any methane measurements; the commonalities between the sources and removal of atmospheric ethane and methane mean that ethane measurements can be used to gain insight into the causes of changes in atmospheric methane levels. The broader impacts of the project include partial support for one Ph.D. student and support for undergraduate researchers at UC Irvine. The PIs group currently has 4 undergraduate researchers. The PI and the graduate students in the UCI ice core laboratory regularly participate in on- and off-campus activities such as laboratory tours and lectures directed towards educating high-school students and science teachers, and the local community at large about the scientific value of polar ice cores as an environmental record of our planet's past. The results of this research will be disseminated via peer-review publications and will contribute to policy-relevant activities such as the IPCC Climate Assessment. Data resulting from this project will be archived in a national data repository. This award does not have field work in Antarctica."

Oceanographers have usually thought that the growth of these nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria is limited at any particular time and place by the supply of either iron, or of phosphorus. Preliminary experiments have shown, though, that these nitrogen fixers instead grow best when both iron and phosphorus are scarce at the same time. In this project, the researchers will use cellular indicators that are specific for iron and phosphorus limitation to determine how important this type of ""balanced limitation"" of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria is in controlling the productivity of ocean food chains in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Two graduate students will be trained at the University of Southern California (USC) and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, as well as a postdoctoral researcher at USC. Educational outreach efforts will take place at a Los Angeles inner city high school with a student body that is over 98% Hispanic and African-American, and with underrepresented undergraduates in the USC Global Environmental Microbiology course. In addition, two Research Experiences for Undergraduates students will be supervised for summer research projects to help them learn about science career options. <br/><br/>The researchers will investigate the biological and biogeochemical consequences of this unique balanced iron/phosphorus-limited phenotype, using both laboratory and fieldwork approaches. During the first year of this project, the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria will be cultured under iron and/or phosphorus limitation, followed by application of proteomics and transcriptomics to identify genes that are potential diagnostic biomarkers for iron/phosphorus balanced limitation. Preliminary work has already identified one promising candidate biomarker in one cyanobacterium, an EzrA protein domain that appears to be associated with the cell size decreases seen specifically under balanced limitation, and the researchers have identified numerous other potential candidates for similar biomarkers. During the second year, these new co-limitation biomarkers and others previously validated for iron limitation (IsiB) and phosphorus limitation (SphX) will be used to investigate balanced limitation during a research cruise transecting from relatively high-iron, low-phosphorus North Atlantic waters, to the relatively high-phosphorus, low-iron South Atlantic. This fieldwork component will survey nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria populations across this natural iron/phosphorus gradient for genetic, proteomic, and physiological indicators of balanced limitation, as well as testing their responses to iron and phosphorus manipulations in shipboard incubation experiments. The third year will be devoted to sample analysis, and publications exploring the responses of oceanic nitrogen fixers to simultaneous limitation by both iron and phosphorus."

Sivey<br/><br/>Proposal Number:  CBET - 1651536 <br/><br/>Bromide is present in virtually all natural waters. When these waters are disinfected prior to use as drinking water or in swimming pools, bromide can be converted into several highly reactive brominating agents. The primary objective of this project will be to understand how these brominating agents can react with naturally occurring organic compounds to generate potentially toxic disinfection by-products. In the educational outreach program sixth-grade math students will explore how linear functions are essential to science and engineering. The overarching goal of this program will be to use inquiry-based, hands-on water chemistry activities to help sixth-grade students connect the mathematics they are learning to real-world scientific questions and careers.<br/><br/>The reactive bromine species in chlorinated drinking water is typically assumed to be HOBr; nevertheless, several additional bromine species can readily form when bromide-containing waters are disinfected with chlorine, including BrCl, BrOCl, and Br2O (collectively, BrX). Despite being highly reactive toward a range of organic compounds, the influence of BrX on formation of brominated disinfection byproducts (DBPs) has received little attention. This project will quantify the influence of individual BrX species on formation rates, yields, and product distributions of several classes of DBPs, including trihalomethanes, haloacetic acids, halophenols, and halosalicylic acids. Humic acid, natural organic matter surrogates, and natural surface waters will serve as sources of organic DBP precursors. Experimental data will be used to develop models describing the effects of bromine speciation on DBP formation.  By evaluating the influence of bromine speciation on DBP formation, the PI will seek to improve our understanding of DBP generation and control measures. As human activities, population growth, and climate change increase halide levels in drinking water (which can, in turn, promote formation of BrX), the importance of understanding bromination processes will be particularly acute. Increased understanding of DBP chemistry will promote societally relevant outcomes, notably the sustainability of drinking water supplies as well as environmental stewardship of other disinfected aqueous systems (e.g., wastewater, ballast water, desalination systems, and swimming pools).  The educational component of this project will involve an interdisciplinary K-12 outreach program, entitled ""The Mathematics of Color and Light."" This program will deliver hands-on, inquiry-based learning activities to sixth-grade math students and will emphasize concepts of light absorption and linear functions. The program will emphasize the role of bleach in water treatment. High school science students, undergraduate researchers, and K-12 teachers will serve as co-facilitators of this program. In total, this project will impact approximately 600 middle school students, 60 high school co-facilitators, several K-12 teachers, and 12 undergraduate students over five years."

Quantifying the effect of transportation projects on city growth and property values has proven difficult for at least two reasons. First, transportation infrastructure may produce growth and a rise in property values, but the latter may also lead to transportation projects. Second, some of the largest and most interesting transportation projects were undertaken long before the advent of computers, so that the associated data has been locked up in disparate paper records. To address these issues, the investigator exploits a unique historical setting in the introduction of the mass-public transit infrastructure in New York City, and further creates novel datasets that have not existed in machine-readable form. These new datasets provide a very high level of geographic resolution and enable the study of spatial economic interactions at a similarly high level of resolution within the city. This extensive database helps shed light on the evolution of spatial development in the city as transportation infrastructure is developed. <br/><br/>This project develops a structural model describing the expansion of the transit network and associated reorganization of economic activities within the city. To achieve this goal, the investigator (1) constructs an integrated spatial framework that explicitly models the impact of transit shocks on location choices of households and firms; (2) digitizes and creates a novel dataset of the late nineteenth and twentieth century New York City and its surrounding areas; (3) takes the data to the model and applies the framework to measure the impact of urban transit infrastructure; (4) develops an identification strategy that allows the estimated impacts to have a causal interpretation. This project provides an integrated framework that can be applicable to many fields where spatial linkages are present, contributing to integrate the fields of trade, economic geography, and urban economics in a unified framework. Results and tools developed from this proposal can be readily incorporated to other circumstances, enabling more theoretically-grounded empirical analyses. Using this structural estimation approach, researchers can conduct both retrospective and prospective policy analysis. Finally, the database created from this project can allow researchers to investigate complex general equilibrium effects in the presence of multiple spatial linkages."

Computational approaches can be used to fill gaps in knowledge but biological complexity demands increasingly sophisticated frameworks, and our field has yet to develop a fully integrated, multi-scale, multiclass heterogeneous model that can be adapted to countless contexts to predict emergence of cell populations. This project offers such a framework where large-scale dynamics arise from individual autonomous cell decisions through a predictive agent based model. Our model includes intra-and intercellular signaling, heterogeneity of cell types (healthy and cancer cells) and states (e.g., proliferative, quiescent, migratory, and others), metabolism of nutrients, and physical orientation and constraints. It will be one of the first models to integrate these biochemical and physical responses in a single framework to predict emergence in the microenvironment. Given its generalizable and flexible framework, people from all disciplines can find familiarity in emergence, providing invaluable cross-disciplinary opportunities for discussion and research. The accessibility of such a model will also enable advanced principles on complexity and emergence to be woven into educational material. In addition to curriculum development, STEM concepts will be introduced to young and diverse audiences through children?s textbooks (with hands-on exercises) that highlight the contribution of women and underrepresented minorities to the field. This effort will involve the collaboration of students from STEM and non-STEM fields to advance best practices of teaching and learning for youth. By making STEM topics more familiar and less procedural, the next generation of students will be guided with a basic understanding of computer science, machine learning, complexity, and biology. This CAREER proposal supports multi-disciplinary research opportunities to catalyze understanding of complex biological systems and facilitate integration of related findings into accessible stories and demonstrations distributed to broad audiences."

Currently, adhesion forces are largely measured qualitatively.  The potential introduction of the instrument into the market will make changes in products quality and the time it takes to develop new products that rely on precise adhesion forces. There are a multitude of potential application areas in the automotive, aerospace, chemical, petroleum, environmental, and medical fields. The irritation of eyes due to the usage of contact lens happens mainly because of the poor adhesion between the lens and the tear drop. The instrument can help the contact lens industry develop contact lenses with better adhesion to the tear drop and therefore reduce the irritation to the eye and prolongs comfortable wear time. Successful implementation of the instrument will enable the industry speed up the development of new products, and build more reliable processes by reducing or eliminating development errors.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will identify the key value propositions of a novel adhesion measuring technology for customer segments across several application areas. Key strategic partners and major competitors within the general areas that align with this technology will be investigated. The intellectual merit of this project lies in the new knowledge that will be obtained regarding product development needs for adhesion measurements that will enable development of more sophisticated products that rely on precise adhesion forces.  The centrifugal adhesion balance (CAB) instrument will potentially upgrade the adhesion measuring approaches from qualitative estimates to exact quantifiable values. This direct measurement of the adhesion is achieved by using a combination of centrifugal and gravitational forces. This combination allows the CAB to produce and measure forces needed for the liquid to detach from the solid.  The ability to manipulate forces acting on a liquid drop to obtain accurate measurements of adhesion forces makes CAB a potentially desirable tool for industrial research and product development."

Funds will be used for transportation, lodging, food, and conference organization. Products from the workshop will include summaries of sessions made available to the public and online, open-access scholarly publications in ""Citizen Science: Theory and Practice,"" the new journal of the Citizen Science Association. In addition, the inception of interdisciplinary conversation in this area should lead to greater attention to the ethical issues arising in citizen science research. The workshop should also lead to increased attention to citizen science research by specialists in research ethics. Such specialists typically focus on regulatory approaches while overlooking extra-regulatory research ethics issues; as a result, they do not provide appropriate guidance for researchers who go into the private sector and are not subject to regulatory requirements. This focus will serve to protect the well-being of citizens from possible risk and to protect the public's trust in the scientific enterprise.  <br/><br/>Technical Summary     <br/><br/>Though members of the lay public have in the past been involved in research, the current scale and rate of growth of citizen science is a new phenomenon. Perhaps due to this novelty, the use and deployment of citizens in research has surged ahead of sustained and intentional reflection on the ethical issues it can raise. Although there is a newly developed Federal Crowdsourcing and Citizen Science toolkit (U.S. Federal Government, 2015), it does not even mention that ethical issues can arise in such work, let alone provide a means to address them. At the same time, many of these projects may not be mandated to receive any ethical oversight if they do not trigger regulatory requirements typically tied to federal funding. Given the fact that citizen science can be used in research already known to raise ethical issues (e.g., collecting identifying information from individuals) and that it can also raise new ethical issues (e.g., maintaining publicly available records of endangered species' dwelling locations), it is clear that citizen science needs to attend to ethical issues even when not compelled to by federal regulations. This workshop is designed to initiate attendance to these issues."

In chemical and pharmaceutical industries, the technology could be very useful for preparation of polymer materials with required properties and small-scale containerless processing of unique polymer materials that lack impurities generated during polymer contact with solid walls.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project further develops a non-contact acoustic tweezing technology in which a drop of a fluid sample is levitated in air by acoustic radiation forces and its time-dependent rheological properties are measured from drop shape changes. Key disruptive features of this technology, tested using the laboratory prototype, are the increased reliability and accuracy due to non-contact measurement, the ability to assess temporal changes in rheological properties during processes such as polymerization and coagulation, small sample volume requirement and relatively short procedure time.   The goal of this project is to do focused customer discovery work in the healthcare, petroleum, chemical and pharmaceutical industries to evaluate the commercial potential of the acoustic tweezing technology."

This conference brings together a diverse group of academic, federal and international researchers to share the latest advances and identify new challenges in coastal ocean dynamics. The conference focuses on novel and recent developments in the application of observations, theory, and numerical modeling and simulation to furthering understanding of coastal ocean processes and our capabilities for their prediction. It is at the coast that human activities are most connected with ocean circulation, and ocean modeling offers great promise for connecting scientific research to societal needs through such efforts as forecasting for marine operations and maritime safety, monitoring and prediction of water quality and the transport and dispersal of water borne pathogens, mapping and characterizing the habitats of marine life, and downscaling global models of climate variability and climatic change to infer their impacts in the coastal zone. The most important broader impact of the conference is the establishment and nurturing of relationships between senior researchers, junior researchers and students. Nearly half of the conference time is allocated to informal interactions among participants, to provide numerous opportunities to build these relationships and exchange ideas among people in different age groups, different sub-disciplines of the field, or from different geographic regions. Funds will be used to expand the demographic, professional and geographic diversity of participants by supporting attendance by under-represented and under-resourced groups who stand to benefit from the intellectual environment and networking opportunities of the Gordon Research Conference and Gordon Research Seminar formats.<br/><br/>This award provides funding for travel and registration support to U.S. based early-career professionals and students to attend the Gordon Research Conference on Coastal Ocean Dynamics which will be held at the University of New England in Biddeford, Maine, June 10-16, 2017. This conference, convened every two years now that the former GRC Coastal Ocean Circulation and Coastal Ocean Modeling have been combined, brings together a diverse group of academic, federal and international researchers to share the latest advances and identify new challenges in coastal ocean dynamics. Here the term ""coastal"" refers to estuarine, littoral zone, continental shelf, and shelf-break regions, including mesoscale exchange processes with the adjacent deep-ocean or marginal seas.  The topics covered will include: 1) High-Latitude Coastal Dynamics and Exchange Processes; 2) Coastal Modeling and Data Assimilation; 3) Recent Advances in Estuarine Dynamics; 4) Fluxes and Transformation across the Outer to Inner Shelves; 5) Coastal Sediment Transport Processes; 6) Challenges and Successes in Physical Oceanography for the Understanding of Fisheries and Other Ecosystems; 7) New Techniques in Satellite Assimilation and Remote Sensing; 8) Multi-Scale Interactions of Coastal Physics and Biogeochemistry; and 9) Recent Anomalous Ocean Conditions and the Coasts Where we Live.

To accomplish these goals, this project will realize the most transformative and broadest reaching cosmological analysis of a unique polarization measurement with the Cosmology Large Angular Scale Surveyor (CLASS). By sponsoring the cosmological research of the PhD students who built and operated CLASS, the project trains the next generation of trailblazing scientists.

The primary goal is to detect and accurately characterize the imprint of Inflationary gravitational waves in the B-mode polarization of the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Another goal is to make a cosmic-variance limited measurement of the CMB E-mode polarization on the largest angular scales to pin down reionization. The CLASS survey is unique: It is the only large scale measurement with broad frequency coverage that probes the full range of angular scales on which inflation and reionization leave their strongest signatures. This study will characterize the primordial B-modes using both reionization and recombination signals across 70% of the sky from 40 to 220 GHz, eliminating systematic errors and testing predictions for the angular spectrum shape and isotropy of the inflationary signal. Because the public survey data will overlap other large-scale surveys from the radio to the X-ray, the scientific legacy of the survey will greatly extend its intellectual merits. An important impact will be the fostering of the next generation of scientists. The project supports cosmological capstone research for graduate students who have built and operated the telescopes. It also builds a bridge for inclusive research and coursework at the undergraduate level.

It supports a project investigating the work experience of Uber drivers and the legal disputes about them and their work. The investigators conducted an extensive ethnographic field study of Uber drivers this year in Boston, and they discovered that Uber's algorithms yield great power over how workers work largely, by revealing certain pieces of information but concealing others. In the project supported by this grant, the investigators will extend their sampling method, interview protocol, and analytic coding to Copenhagen, Denmark, for comparative purposes. They aim to understand Uber's emergent ""digital working class"" in another political economy (a social democracy), with different norms concerning urban transportation (a strong cultural preference for bicycling), and under a different legal system and legal consciousness. The research will generate insights for academic and policy audiences interested in regulating this workforce and its activity. The results will be reported in several articles written for both specialist and non-specialist audiences, and contribute to a doctoral dissertation to be later published as a book.<br/><br/>Technical Summary<br/><br/>The investigators will work towards bridging a gap in understanding about new kinds of work that are emerging consequent to technology by comparing qualitative data about the experience of Uber workers in two national contexts, the US (Boston) and Denmark (Copenhagen). They plan to acquire and analyze ethnographic data alongside historical and contemporary legal disputes about labor in general and ride-for-hire in particular. As sociologists and STS scholars, the investigators are interested in the relationship between individuals and organizations, including regulatory ones, in the information economy. While ensuing legal case have focused on questions such as whether to classify ""on-demand"" workers as employees or contractors and whether the service provided is safe, the investigators will focus on underlying debates having to do with class and power, equity and fairness, and design and use in the emergence of new technology."

Often, a number of people -- close and distant family, friends and neighbors, clinicians -- act as an informal, loosely structured team of caregivers for a given patient, and though professional care teams in hospitals are well-studied, much less is known about how these loosely structured home caregiving teams communicate and share information in order to provide good care.  To build this understanding, and to inform the design of consumer health information technologies that might support these teams, the researchers will observe, interview, and survey caregivers in Alzheimer's Disease patients' homes. Questions will focus on aspects of teamwork including the different roles caregivers play and how they change over time; the tools and methods they use to find, save, and share information; and the ways they make care decisions both as individuals and as groups. Using the data, and starting from existing models of professional caregiving teams and general models of teamwork, the researchers will develop new models of informal teamwork that are grounded in the activities of home caregiving; then, working with caregivers and clinicians, they will develop design requirements and ideas for tools to help caregiving teams address problems identified by the models. These models and design ideas will be a first step in a longer line of research that will apply to many different health conditions, and support caregiving not just in person but online and virtually.  The researchers will also work to make their findings widely available, through outreach to caregiver support groups and senior centers and through a public blog that will provide frequent updates on the progress of the research.  As part of the work, the lead researcher will train two new PhD students to conduct the interviews, observations, analysis, and design work. <br/><br/>Working with partners at the Wisconsin Alzheimer's Disease Research Center and a local Veteran's Affairs Hospital, the researchers will recruit 20 patients with Alzheimer's Disease or related dementias and several members of each patient's caregiving team, including their primary caregiver.  Using a modified critical incident technique, teams of two researchers (one leader, one note-taker) will conduct interviews and surveys at patients' homes both for comfort and to support observation of the caregiving environment, particularly around the identification and discussion of artifacts used by the caregiving team.  The analysis of the data will be guided by both the theory of distributed cognition and by two existing models of socio-technical work in healthcare systems, the Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety and the Patient Work System model, using a coding system based on those models but allowing for the identification and inclusion of new themes and codes.  These analyses will then be represented using the Epistemic Network Analysis method, which blends elements of social network and discourse analysis, to capture the patterns of communication, information management, and cognitive work that emerge.  Design requirements and low-fidelity prototypes will be developed based on the models, then discussed with several focus groups that include both caregivers and experts in caregiving, including geriatricians, nurses, and social workers to identify the potential problems that might be ameliorated (or caused) by the prototype designs."

Low oxygen concentrations affect rates of denitrification, a microbial process in which nitrate is converted to nitrogen gas.  This can lead to significant losses of nitrate from the ocean. Nitrate is an important nutrient in the ocean that supports ocean ecosystems.  Ocean warming is likely to expand these ODZs making it imperative we understand the role of the ODZs on the chemistry and biology of these regions. This understanding requires repeated sampling of nutrient and oxygen concentrations through time. The investigator plans to utilize available ship time from an existing grant to sample the Eastern Tropical North Pacific (ETNP) ODZ six times over a two year period during the spring, summer, and winter months. The aim is to determine the permanence and seasonality of the recent expansion of the ODZ in the ETNP, as well as identify the processes responsible for any observed changes. This research will support the University of Washington's Masters in Science for Science Teachers program, which provides a link between researchers, graduate students, and elementary aged youth, and there will be funds provided for two undergraduate students to participate in two research cruises on the R/V Thompson.<br/><br/>This project seeks to answer whether observed increased rates of denitrification in the ODZ of the ETNP are solely due to a growing oxygen deficiency problem or can be attributed to sample timing and seasonality. Additionally, the increased loss of nitrate will be investigated to conclude whether it really is due to increased rates of denitrification in the ODZ or some other cause. Climate model simulations predict a large perturbation to the dissolved oxygen content of the ocean, which could have further consequences than purely oxygen chemistry. This study hopes to answer the question of how climate change impacts on dissolved oxygen will affect denitrification in the ocean, which in turn has a much larger effect on limiting marine productivity."

Among many biodiversity hotpots around the world, southern Africa is particularly well-known for its diverse and unique plants and animals. Over the past decade, scientists have documented more than 600 species of grasshoppers from this region. Grasshoppers are ecologically and economically important as they are critical components of terrestrial ecosystems, especially grasslands, and include several serious pest species. Despite the years of biodiversity research in southern Africa, scientists have recognized that there is a certain fauna that has never been fully explored - the flightless grasshoppers occupying the mountain forests in South Africa. The forest patches and isolated mountain peaks in this area represent habitat islands, and there is no other land-based system of habitat islands in the world with the number, size, and configurational complexity as the Afromontane zone in South Africa. This project focuses on understanding the total diversity of grasshoppers in this amazing and complex landscape and the processes shaping this diversity. The results from this project will provide critical information about species diversification in complex habitats and help researchers better understand species diversity and distributions in similar habitats in the US and around the world.<br/><br/>This project will focus on the grasshopper family Lentulidae, which is endemic to southern Africa, and address the following two questions: (i) What is the total species diversity of Lentulidae in the alpine and Afromontane regions in South Africa? and (ii) What are patterns of speciation and diversification in Lentulidae as related to their geographic distribution? Scientists will explore inselbergs (isolated mountain peaks rising abruptly from surroundings) and adjacent plateaus in the Drakensberg Escarpment and the Afromontane forest patches in South Africa in search of new species. Using modern taxonomic techniques, the scientists will rapidly describe this unique grasshopper fauna and make the resulting specimen-level data digitally available to the public. The project will also reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among the focal taxa to examine how these small flightless grasshoppers have colonized and diversified in isolated inselbergs and Afromontane forest patches. Specifically, genome-scale single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data will be generated using RAD-Seq to estimate phylogeographic patterns as well as for inferring population genetic structures for those species that appear to be widespread. The project will provide hands-on research and mentoring experience for undergraduate students at Texas A&M University and Drexel University."

This approach to nanostructure synthesis has applications in biotechnology, energy and tooling, among others.  For example, in the healthcare field each year nearly one million people in the United States suffer from an infection related to medical implants. Additionally, implants in bone can loosen over their lifetime due to poor tissue integration, resulting in inflammation and pain, and possibly requiring additional surgeries. These issues can potentially be solved through the synthesis of inherently anti-bacterial biomaterial surfaces that enhance biological tissue integration.  The commercialization of this technology has the potential to redefine industrial material design paradigms.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project is based around a form of plasma processing of materials called Directed Irradiation Synthesis (DIS) and Directed Plasma Nanosynthesis (DPNS).  This technology is able to change the inherent properties of a material surface by creating customized nanoscale topographies (pores, rods, cones, ripples, etc.) and chemistries (stoichiometry, oxidation state, etc.) by exposing the surface to a controlled flux of ions, electrons, and neutral particles with controlled mass, momentum, and fluence, among other conditions.  This allows a new level of fidelity with atom-by-atom control using self-organized arrangement in irradiated surfaces that is dominated by ion-induced erosion and surface diffusion.  This technology will transform the synthesis and design of nano-structured systems by leveraging the composition-dependent mechanisms that drive self-organization on micro- and nano-structures to enable tunability and control of their biological properties."

Oceanographers have usually thought that the growth of these nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria is limited at any particular time and place by the supply of either iron, or of phosphorus. Preliminary experiments have shown, though, that these nitrogen fixers instead grow best when both iron and phosphorus are scarce at the same time. In this project, the researchers will use cellular indicators that are specific for iron and phosphorus limitation to determine how important this type of ""balanced limitation"" of nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria is in controlling the productivity of ocean food chains in the tropical Atlantic Ocean. Two graduate students will be trained at the University of Southern California (USC) and Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution, as well as a postdoctoral researcher at USC. Educational outreach efforts will take place at a Los Angeles inner city high school with a student body that is over 98% Hispanic and African-American, and with underrepresented undergraduates in the USC Global Environmental Microbiology course. In addition, two Research Experiences for Undergraduates students will be supervised for summer research projects to help them learn about science career options. <br/><br/>The researchers will investigate the biological and biogeochemical consequences of this unique balanced iron/phosphorus-limited phenotype, using both laboratory and fieldwork approaches. During the first year of this project, the nitrogen-fixing cyanobacteria will be cultured under iron and/or phosphorus limitation, followed by application of proteomics and transcriptomics to identify genes that are potential diagnostic biomarkers for iron/phosphorus balanced limitation. Preliminary work has already identified one promising candidate biomarker in one cyanobacterium, an EzrA protein domain that appears to be associated with the cell size decreases seen specifically under balanced limitation, and the researchers have identified numerous other potential candidates for similar biomarkers. During the second year, these new co-limitation biomarkers and others previously validated for iron limitation (IsiB) and phosphorus limitation (SphX) will be used to investigate balanced limitation during a research cruise transecting from relatively high-iron, low-phosphorus North Atlantic waters, to the relatively high-phosphorus, low-iron South Atlantic. This fieldwork component will survey nitrogen fixing cyanobacteria populations across this natural iron/phosphorus gradient for genetic, proteomic, and physiological indicators of balanced limitation, as well as testing their responses to iron and phosphorus manipulations in shipboard incubation experiments. The third year will be devoted to sample analysis, and publications exploring the responses of oceanic nitrogen fixers to simultaneous limitation by both iron and phosphorus."

The use of nanophotonic technology for detection of different medically relevant biomarkers enables the development of ultra-compact highly sensitive, and highly multiplexed sensors that are urgently needed for multiple medical diagnostic scenarios, including cancer. The ability to detect multiple blood biomarkers in a reasonable time with high sensitivity and specificity at a low cost will have a potentially transformative impact on healthcare by bringing diagnostic tools at the point-of-care.

The mobility and simplicity of the visual display also allow same solution to be used by patients and health care professionals outside the walls of traditional institutions, and in settings where there is currently limited or no access to them.  Missed vascular access attempts are estimated to cost the U.S. healthcare system $6 billion dollars annually, and patient satisfaction is currently tied to Medicare reimbursement. Vascular access is one of the most frequently preformed procedures in hospitals, and the proposed device provides an affordable opportunity for those facilities to improve patient satisfaction across a broad patient population. Blood banks and donation centers rely on volunteers for their supply and the satisfaction of such donors is crucial to their ability to recruit future volunteers or repeat-donors. These facilities are strongly incentivized to provide as positive a patient experience as possible, starting with minimizing the number of vascular access attempts. The device can also be adapted for non-clinical situations, such as emergency or battlefield environments.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project uses the unique interaction of deoxygenated blood with light at near infrared wavelengths to create a live, real time video feed of the patients body with the peripheral vasculature clearly differentiated from the surrounding dermal, arterial, and adipose tissue.  This allows for practitioners to observe the physical location of the veins, get an estimate for relative vein depth, and observe factors that are known to confound access attempts, such as vascular movement or rolling. This also allows for superior vein location in patients with physical traits or impairments that make vascular access more difficult.  A preliminary prototype demonstrates the claims made and rudimentary testing has been completed to demonstrate functionality in a variety of environments."

These systems operate at a scale where machine crashes and network interruptions are the rule rather than the exception.  Unfortunately, writing fault tolerant software -- programs that attempt to detect and mitigate such failures, in order to prevent data loss or system unavailability -- remains an art form.  Application programmers, data analysts and mobile developers have few tools to help them implement, maintain and debug fault-tolerant systems. To address these needs, we introduce lineage-driven fault injection (LDFI), a novel bug-finding methodology that uses data lineage to reason backwards (from effects to causes) about combinations of faults could prevented desired system outcomes. If the project succeeds, it will improve the overall availability and resiliency of these increasingly critical systems. It will also provide a new class of tools for the distributed programmers who must build and maintain cloud systems, identifying and explaining bugs at all stages of the development process, from specification to post-production.  <br/><br/><br/>LDFI combines ideas from database theory, distributed systems, formal methods, optimization, reliability and data visualization. By exercising only the faults that it can prove could have affected a known good outcome, LDFI can identify invariant violations and user-visible failures using orders of magnitude fewer executions than conventional techniques such as random or heuristic fault injection. LDFI generalizes the notion of data lineage beyond data management , using it to explain large-scale system outcomes and to identify redundant computations that can mask faults. Given a model of a system's built-in redundancy, LDFI can use state-of-the-art solvers to generate hypotheses to exercise via fault injection infrastructures. This project engenders new research in areas such as query explanations, low-overhead system tracing, and how-to analysis."

Among many biodiversity hotpots around the world, southern Africa is particularly well-known for its diverse and unique plants and animals. Over the past decade, scientists have documented more than 600 species of grasshoppers from this region. Grasshoppers are ecologically and economically important as they are critical components of terrestrial ecosystems, especially grasslands, and include several serious pest species. Despite the years of biodiversity research in southern Africa, scientists have recognized that there is a certain fauna that has never been fully explored - the flightless grasshoppers occupying the mountain forests in South Africa. The forest patches and isolated mountain peaks in this area represent habitat islands, and there is no other land-based system of habitat islands in the world with the number, size, and configurational complexity as the Afromontane zone in South Africa. This project focuses on understanding the total diversity of grasshoppers in this amazing and complex landscape and the processes shaping this diversity. The results from this project will provide critical information about species diversification in complex habitats and help researchers better understand species diversity and distributions in similar habitats in the US and around the world.<br/><br/>This project will focus on the grasshopper family Lentulidae, which is endemic to southern Africa, and address the following two questions: (i) What is the total species diversity of Lentulidae in the alpine and Afromontane regions in South Africa? and (ii) What are patterns of speciation and diversification in Lentulidae as related to their geographic distribution? Scientists will explore inselbergs (isolated mountain peaks rising abruptly from surroundings) and adjacent plateaus in the Drakensberg Escarpment and the Afromontane forest patches in South Africa in search of new species. Using modern taxonomic techniques, the scientists will rapidly describe this unique grasshopper fauna and make the resulting specimen-level data digitally available to the public. The project will also reconstruct the evolutionary relationships among the focal taxa to examine how these small flightless grasshoppers have colonized and diversified in isolated inselbergs and Afromontane forest patches. Specifically, genome-scale single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data will be generated using RAD-Seq to estimate phylogeographic patterns as well as for inferring population genetic structures for those species that appear to be widespread. The project will provide hands-on research and mentoring experience for undergraduate students at Texas A&M University and Drexel University."

Macfarlane of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is supported by the Macromolecular, Supramolecular, and Nanochemistry (MSN) program of the Division of Chemistry and the Solid State and Materials Chemistry (SSMC) program in the Division of Materials Research to develop nanocomposite building blocks composed of polymer grafted nanoparticles.  These building blocks are capable of assembling into ordered structures via molecular interactions, and may therefore be used to synthesize new composite materials with controllable physical properties.  The  project provides a new framework for controlling material structure across several length scales, generating materials by design for applications ranging from energy harvesting and storage to sensing technologies. The associated educational plans of the project focuses on the establishment of an outreach program to provide research experiences for community college educators and students.  The goals are to promote the involvement of students in cutting edge research techniques and to provide a pathway to future careers in STEM fields. <br/> <br/>In this project, nanocomposite building blocks (so called nanocomposite tectons, NCTs) are developed and used to manipulate the structure and composition of new materials at the atomic, nano, and macroscopic length scales simultaneously. NCTs consist of polymer grafted nanoparticles, where each polymer chain terminates in a functional group capable of supramolecular bonding.  Tuning of the bonding interactions of the NCTs allows for the directed assembly of nanoparticle superlattices.  The various design parameters which influence the self-assembly process (such as particle size, shape and composition, polymer composition and length, supramolecular group identity, solvent and matrix) are investigated.  Furthermore, the thermodynamic and kinetic parameters associated with NCT assembly are determined.  The goal is to assemble polymer-nanoparticle composites whose nanoscale structure induces unique optical phenomena such as photonic band gaps or coupled plasmon resonances."

The simplicity of these systems allow them to be re-purposed for a range of biotechnological applications. These specific 'guides' can recognize DNA even if it has only a partial match. This turns out to be a useful characteristic for bacteria but can be highly problematic for most biotechnological applications. This project has the overall goals of understanding how this feature benefits bacterial immunity and of improving the efficiency of tools based on this emerging technology.

This course will help train students in science communication and to engage in informal scientific discussions with the public.<br/><br/><br/>The overall goal of this proposal is to define and improve the sequence specificity of Class 2 CRISPR-Cas endonucleases. The specific scientific goals are to: 1) define the effects of gRNA and target sequence on the specificity of Cas endonucleases using high-throughput screens; 2) determine how Cas endonuclease specificity affects CRISPR-Cas immunity against rapidly evolving viral invaders; 3) create a complementary tool for improved Cas endonuclease specificity using chemically modified gRNAs. Successful completion of the proposed work will reveal the importance of CRISPR-Cas fidelity for endogenous immunity and host-virus co-evolution. In addition, development of high-throughput specificity screens will enable rapid assessment of a variety of Cas endonucleases that could be harnessed for biotechnological applications. Results from these screens will facilitate improved design of gRNAs to reduce the risk of non-specific genome editing. Finally, studies of chemically modified gRNAs will catalog the effects of chemical modifications on Cas endonuclease activity and specificity, allowing for the identification of optimal modification sites and implementation of these improved gRNAs in in vivo genome editing studies."

A central goal of the field is to provide such an explanation, but there is no adequate view as to how this should be done. The researcher proposes an interdisciplinary approach; he will provide a mechanistic explanation of cognition that integrates key elements from philosophy, neuroscience, and psychology. Specifically, he proposes to articulate a comprehensive framework of multilevel neurocognitive mechanisms that perform neural computations. The framework will enable scientists and philosophers to compare, evaluate, and integrate theories from different areas of cognitive science. He will make use of the results of his research in his courses in Philosophy of Mind and Philosophy of Cognitive Science, which are enrolled in by both undergraduate and graduate students in philosophy, psychology, and neuroscience. These courses will be redesigned to facilitate the training of students to think and explain cognitive phenomena in terms of mechanisms spanning multiple levels and drawing from different fields. The PI will describe the results of his research in an accessible way for the general public; he will write a series of blog posts explaining the results of his research in clear, accessible terms on philosophyofbrains.com, and he will also rewrite his public lecture on how cognitive neuroscience explains cognition to include the results of this project.  <br/><br/>Technical Summary     <br/><br/>Developing an account of multilevel neurocognitive mechanisms is an important step toward unifying the sciences of the mind. The core of the proposed research consists of three theses. First, levels of organization (organism, nervous system, brain, cortical area, neural network, neuron, etc.) are ontologically on a par, meaning that lower levels are not more fundamental than higher levels, nor vice versa. Second, it is necessary to include the ways in which offline processing increases the representational power of mental models; this thesis contrasts with traditional accounts of mental representation, which focus primarily on mental representations that correlate with the environment in real time. Third, phenomenal consciousness has a functional nature without being (wholly) computational. The account just characterized will build on work in philosophy of science regarding mechanistic explanation, neural computation, and neural representation. The proposed framework will allow researchers in cognitive neuroscience working across different levels of organization to understand how their findings contribute to a unified science of cognition. Understanding the relationship between the mind and the nervous system more deeply has the potential to transform the debate about the place of the mind in the physical world in both science and humanities disciplines."

This has contributed to the widespread perception that privacy may no longer be capable of fulfilling its traditional role in American politics: preserving and promoting individual liberty, dignity, and self-expression. In response, government, academic, civil society, and private sector institutions have launched an unprecedented number of technology-based projects designed to protect privacy for future generations. In this context, understanding the conditions under which technological design and engineering can meaningfully contribute to privacy protections is critical for developing programs and policies that can unlock the economic, scientific, and societal potential of new data technologies while still guaranteeing Americans' access to privacy's personal, political, and cultural benefits. Findings from this project, which trains a graduate student in methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, will be disseminated to organizations that manage and develop policy related to privacy.<br/><br/>Lake Polan, under the guidance of anthropologist Dr. Joseph P. Masco of the University of Chicago, will investigate the efforts of Silicon Valley-based technology corporations to preserve privacy on the Internet using design and engineering. The project will be carried out through twelve months of research, including eleven months of ethnographic fieldwork in the San Francisco headquarters of Mozilla and one month of interviewing technologists, regulators, and other stakeholders in Washington, D.C. Mozilla is a well-known not-for-profit technology corporation, which develops Firefox, the third most popular web browser in the U.S. As a matter of official corporate policy, Mozilla is committed to protecting the privacy of users of Firefox and of the Internet in general. Through long-term, first person observation, the project will explore Mozilla's efforts to honor this principle by engineering privacy directly ""into"" the features and properties of its web browsing software. Mozilla's self-identified role as a leader in the industry-wide effort to enhance Internet privacy protections will enable project researchers to make a legally and socially significant assessment of the technological basis of privacy today, thus facilitating timely interventions in ongoing public policy debates about privacy, personal information, technology, and surveillance."

Meeting the global demand for earth resources represents a grand challenge for modern society. The Industry-University Cooperative Research Center for Advanced Subsurface Earth Resource Models is a collaborative effort between Colorado School of Mines, Virginia Tech, and industry partners. The planning meeting for this Center, for which this award provides support, focused on developing an integrated approach to locating, characterizing, and visualizing mineral deposits and other earth resources to meet this grand challenge. The intellectual foundation for this Center stems from the unique cross-disciplinary collaborations that have been assembled at the Colorado School of Mines and Virginia Tech including melding expertise in the traditional geoscience disciplines of mineralogy, geochemistry, petrology, economic geology, and geophysics with those in temporal spatial statistics, inverse theory, numerical methods, high performance computing, seismic imaging and inversion, tomographic imaging, and petrophysics. The Center's activities will transform the way geoscience data are used in the exploration and mining industry sector, beginning with the initial mineral exploratoration stage and continuing through mine closure and environmental remediation. Research activities of the Center will fundamentally change the way global exploration and mining of natural resources is currently done, replacing industry experience- and empiricism-based decisions with innovative science and technology-based solutions that inform decision making, increase the chances of exploration success, and reduce financial risk. The goals of the Center will promote socio-economic prosperity and help to reduce the environmental impact of mining.  Workforce development is an essential component of the Center activities and will include graduate and undergraduate students, and industry employee participation in research activities and training opportunities.  It is anticipated that graduates of the Center will acquire intellectual breadth that will transfer to the mining workforce and this expertise will be essential for the coming transformations that are reshaping the industry.  The Center will strengthen and promote cross-disciplinary discoveries in geophysics, geochemistry, mineralogy, computational science and statistics.<br/><br/>The Center for Advanced Subsurface Earth Resource Models is focused on advancing the exploration/mining industry sector through the establishment of a cooperative industry-university-National Science Foundation partnership that conducts pre-competitive research and workforce development programs of benefit to industry, academia, and society.

Four research thrusts are envisioned: (1) development of novel geophysical and geochemical instrumentation, analysis and interpretation methods for enhanced characterization of rock properties; (2) integration, scaling, and inversion of diverse geological, petrophysical, and geophysical data types of dissimilar spatial resolution and distribution to identify and characterize subsurface earth resources; (3) development of information methodologies for reducing risk associated with decision making; and (4) computational imaging and visualization and development of graphical and exploratory data analysis solutions and visualization tools.  Achieving this broad vision requires collaboration of researchers from a broad range of disciplines, including but not limited to economic geologists, geophysicists, statisticians, and computational mathematicians. Complementary expertise in these areas brings Colorado School of Mines and Virginia Tech together with industry partners in an innovative partnership to form a Center focused on the mining sector. With regard to the value that Virginia Tech brings, it has a large and established community of researchers working on the development and applications of computational imaging to applied problems. Research specialties include inverse theory, numerical methods, high performance computing, seismic acquisition, seismic imaging and inversion, tomographic imaging, and petrophysics. In addition, Virginia Tech is home to the largest Mining and Minerals Engineering Department in the country, as well as one of the strongest inverse problems communities in the nation, and strong cross-college expertise in seismology."

This award will fund the analysis of that data to determine whether the measurements are able to provide enough information to answer the many outstanding questions about the characteristics of wildfire plumes.  The potential impact of the project is on the validation and improvement of fire behavior models, which may allow a safer and more efficient usage of air and ground resources for fighting wildfires.  There is also a significant connection between wildfire plumes and aviation and air quality.  <br/><br/>The researcher will analyze data collected during the Rapid Deployment to Wildfires (RaDFIRE-2016) campaign which sampled a large wildfire northeast of Boise, Idaho in August 2016.

The RaDFIRE campaign was an initial test to determine whether instruments on the University of Wyoming King Air research aircraft could successfully observe important wildfire characteristics.  Initial analysis suggests that the test was successful, but more thorough analysis is needed to determine whether the data is adequate enough to answer unresolved questions about plume dynamics and microphysics.  The project fits within the EAGER program at NSF due to the focus on untested but potentially transformative research ideas that employ a radically different analysis approach."

This RAPID project will document how human interventions on the landscape surrounding the Amite River may have influenced the extent and patterns of flooding. Specifically, mining of gravel from the river and floodplains has led to large areas of mobile sand and channel shortening as well as the subsequent remobilization of sediment into cypress swamps and delta regions. Data gathered from this project will map the extent of high water and sediment deposition in order to develop models that will help predict the response to future heavy-rainfall episodes.<br/><br/><br/>This RAPID project will support a field effort (1) to document the geomorphic response of the Amite River to the August 2016 rainfall, (2) to analyze channel planform changes and cross-check with remote-sensing images and (3) to develop numerical models for predicting morphological response to future events. In addition, the research will examine flood layer deposition in the lower Amite River basin to quantify and map the sediment distribution from the flood. Choking of the lower basin channel by bed-load material may have exacerbated backwater flooding in some areas. However, the sediment may also nourish the cypress-tupelo swamps in the lower basin that have been sediment-starved due to isolation from the Mississippi River and are drowning under rising sea levels."

Preliminary data indicate an active subsurface biosphere in samples of the lower oceanic crust collected from Atlantis Bank in the SW Indian Ocean as deep as 790 m below the seafloor. Even if life exists in only a fraction of the habitable volume where temperatures permit and fluid flow can deliver carbon and energy sources, an active lower oceanic crust biosphere would have implications for deep carbon budgets and yield insights into microbiota that may have existed on early Earth. This is all of great interest to other research disciplines, educators, and students alike. A K-12 education program will capitalize on groundwork laid by outreach collaborator, A. Martinez, a 7th grade teacher in Eagle Pass, TX, who sailed as outreach expert on Drilling Expedition 360. Martinez works at a Title 1 school with ~98% Hispanic and ~2% Native American students and a high number of English Language Learners and migrants. Annual school visits occur during which the project investigators present hands on-activities introducing students to microbiology, and talks on marine microbiology, the project, and how to pursue science related careers. In addition, monthly Skype meetings with students and PIs update them on project progress. Students travel to the University of Texas Marine Science Institute annually, where they get a campus tour and a 3-hour cruise on the R/V Katy, during which they learn about and help with different oceanographic sampling approaches. The project partially supports two graduate students, a Woods Hole undergraduate summer student, the participation of multiple Texas A+M undergraduate students, and 3 principal investigators at two institutions, including one early career researcher who has not previously received NSF support of his own. <br/><br/>Given the dearth of knowledge of the lower oceanic crust, this project is poised to transform our understanding of life in this vast environment. The project assesses metabolic functions within all three domains of life in this crustal biosphere, with a focus on nutrient cycling and evaluation of connections to other deep marine microbial habitats. The lower ocean crust represents a potentially vast biosphere whose microbial constituents and the biogeochemical cycles they mediate are likely linked to deep ocean processes through faulting and subsurface fluid flow. Atlantis Bank represents a tectonic window that exposes lower oceanic crust directly at the seafloor. This enables seafloor drilling and research on an environment that can transform our understanding of connections between the deep subseafloor biosphere and the rest of the ocean. Preliminary analysis of recovered rocks from Expedition 360 suggests the interaction of seawater with the lower oceanic crust creates varied geochemical conditions capable of supporting diverse microbial life by providing nutrients and chemical energy.  This project is the first interdisciplinary investigation of the microbiology of all 3 domains of life in basement samples that combines diversity and ""meta-omics"" analyses, analysis of nutrient addition experiments, high-throughput culturing and physiological analyses of isolates, including evaluation of their ability to utilize specific carbon sources, Raman spectroscopy, and lipid biomarker analyses. Comparative genomics are used to compare genes and pathways relevant to carbon cycling in these samples to data from published studies of other deep-sea environments. The collected samples present a rare and time-sensitive opportunity to gain detailed insights into microbial life, available carbon and energy sources for this life, and of dispersal of microbiota and connections in biogeochemical processes between the lower oceanic crust and the overlying aphotic water column."

Climate change and other detrimental environment factors are likely to blame. Unhealthy coral reefs cannot support the fish and other life that make the reef a vibrant and diverse ecosystem.  Corals reefs in the Caribbean Sea are disease hotspots and many reefs have experienced population collapses due to outbreaks of disease. Importantly, coral species vary in their susceptible to disease, but the reasons behind this variation are unknown. This project will quantify coral susceptibility to disease by examining coral immunity using several novel approaches and experiments. Seven species of coral that differ in disease susceptibility, growth rates, growth form and reproductive strategies will be used. Immune responses of each species of coral will be measured by exposing the corals to bacterial immune stimulators. Susceptibility to white plague disease, a prevalent disease affecting many species of corals, will also be measured by exposing the corals to active white plague disease and calculating disease transmission rates. The immune response and disease transmission data for each coral species will be used to develop a predictive model to determine how different coral communities will respond to disease threats under climate change scenarios. This project will support graduate students at University of Texas, Arlington (Hispanic-serving Institution) and University of Virgin Islands (Historically Black University) and many undergraduate students at all three institutions (Mote Marine Laboratory). This research will be highlighted at outreach events at all three institutions which take place regularly and include Earth Day Texas in Dallas, TX, Mote's Living Reef Exhibit and Aquarium in Sarasota, FL and ""Reef Fest"" and Agricultural fairs in the U.S. Virgin Islands.<br/><br/>Environmental changes, such as ocean warming, have led to an increase in the prevalence of coral diseases, causing region-wide population collapses in some locations. However, not all coral species, or even populations within species, are affected by disease equally. Some species are host to many different types of diseases, but have limited mortality. Other species suffer significant disease-related mortality. How and why disease susceptibility differs among species and the effects of this differential susceptibility on reef community structure and composition are currently unknown. This project will use immune-challenge experiments that will quantify novel components of the innate immune system of corals, coupled with the application of a trait-based model, to fulfill three goals: 1) Determine variability of coral immune traits in seven common coral species found on Caribbean reefs, 2) Determine the variability in resistance to white plague disease transmission in the same coral species 3) Develop a predictive model of coral community assemblage that incorporates immune traits. Quantification of coral immunity will also incorporate unique approaches, such as combining full transcriptome sequencing with protein activity assays for a gene-to-phenotype analysis. Data will be mapped onto immune pathways for comprehensive pathway evaluation between coral species and these will serve as trait inputs into a ""traitspace"" model. These traits will provide continuous data within the model, which will create a probability density function (PDF) for the trait distributions of each species. These PDFs will then be used to determine the probability of species under different disease exposure scenarios. Model analyses will determine which traits influence community structure and characterize how disease exposure and the immune response will predict community assemblages through space and time. The completion and application of a trait-base model that incorporates extensive immunity parameters (none of which have been applied to trait models within coral ecosystems) is a distinct product from this project."

And urban experts often understand the fortunes and failures of growth and development as a function of a city's links to the local and, increasingly today, the global economy. But what is the precise role of municipal government in responding to and intervening in such economic change today? How do city governments respond to novel demands of rapid urbanization and widespread economic change? At the same time that many cities in the United States are undergoing economic decline and depopulation, cities in the Global South are contributing to a new era of urban growth. Yet when American styles of growth management are displaced to cities elsewhere in the world, they are presented with very different social and economic contexts. Understanding the effects of such policy transfers is critical for developing new policies and programs oriented towards the specific demands of urban growth in a global and cross-cultural context. Findings from this project, which trains a graduate student in methods of empirical, scientific data collection and analysis, will be disseminated to organizations that manage and develop policy for urban planning and development. The research also fosters international scientific cooperation.<br/><br/>James Christopher Mizes, under the supervision of Dr. Teresa Caldeira, will conduct 18 months of participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and archival research on the role of municipal finance reform in the development of urban and regional economies. The majority of this research will take place in Dakar (Senegal) with additional sites in Abidjan (Cte d'Ivoire), and Washington, D.C. (U.S.A.). Dakar is an appropriate primary research site because the city is a model of urban governance and administration in Sub-Saharan Africa. Further, the City of Dakar is experimenting with programs supported by the U.S. government that are aimed at issuing the region's first municipal bonds on the regional securities market. In an effort to improve the city's finances and pay back impending debts, the City of Dakar has renewed its efforts to increase the revenues it collects from the urban informal economy. At the same time, the municipality has also developed an ambitious plan to relocate many of Dakar's vendors from the urban street. This research will examine how urban streets and municipal finance have come to be understood as contemporary problems, how an evolving set of governmental strategies are responding to these problems, and the resulting constellation of economic practices in urban street markets and regional securities markets."

An optimal combination of the probe length, conformation, and linker length will be identified. Second, optimal combination of the diacetylene structure, phospholipid additives, and vesicle size will be determined. These activities will shed light on the roles of each controllable parameter in experimentally observed sensor performances. Subsequently, successful capture probe and PDA designs will be used for developing printable sensors on paper substrates and injectable vesicle sensors in suspension, both targeting a bacterial plant pathogen, Pantoea stewartii. Collectively, this project is expected to produce new knowledge in design of PDA biosensor parameters and their role in signal generation and transduction. End application will include disseminating low cost sensor technology in East Africa through collaborators.  In addition, a new undergraduate/graduate course on low cost diagnostic technology will be introduced and outreach to K-12 teachers and students is also planned.

Over the next decade the goal is to build HPC parallel system capable of extreme-scale performance (one exaflop (1018)operations per second) and processing exabyte (1018) of data. However, one of the biggest challenges of achieving extreme-scale performance is what is known as the hardware memory wall, which is about the growing gap between the speed of computation performed by CPU and the speed of supplying data to the CPU from memory systems (about x100 time slower). The low performance efficiency of modern HPC system (average <60% and could be as low as 5%) manifests the memory wall impact since a huge amount of computation cycles are wasted for waiting for the arrival of input data.  It becomes very critical to create effective software solutions for achieving the computation potential of hardware and for improving the efficiency and usability of the existing and future computing system. Such solutions will significantly benefit a broad range of disciplines that use parallel computers to solve scientific and engineering problems, and accelerate scientific discovery and problem solving to improve quality of life of the society. <br/>This CAREER project develops innovative software techniques to address the programming and performance challenges of the existing and emerging memory systems: 1) a portable abstract machine model for programming, compiling and executing parallel applications, 2) new programming interface and model for data mapping, movement, and consistency, and 3) machine-aware compilation and data-aware scheduling techniques to realize an asynchronous task flow execution model to hide the latency of data movement. It addresses the memory wall challenge by developing a memory-centric programming paradigm for helping achieve extreme-scale performance of parallel applications with minimum impairment to programmability.

The additive manufacturing industry exceeds $5 billion in 2015 and is expected to top $20 billion within the next five years. It has become an extremely competitive area of research in countries around the world. To ensure US' global leadership in this emerging field originated from the US, academic partners (currently including Georgia Institute of Technology (GT), University of Connecticut (UConn), and University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML)) have come together to create the Center for Science of Heterogeneous Additive Printing of 3D Materials (SHAP3D). SHAP3D will serve the diverse interests of industry, government, and academia by addressing fundamental research challenges to meet the commercial needs of industry for 3D printing of heterogeneous materials. SHAP3D will develop the critical and necessary insight into fundamental processing-structure-property relationships to predict and control the integration of diverse materials for 3D printing. The work of SHAP3D will be critical as the industry adopts 3D printing for product prototyping, tooling, and higher volume manufacturing with three specific economic outcomes. First, the Center will pursue higher performance materials and composites that enable diverse and lighter weight products to minimize total life cycle costs and environmental footprint. Second, in order to minimize processing costs, the Center will explore more optimal and parallel processes to more quickly print products with higher resolution. Third, SHAP3D will investigate interfacial physics and design concepts for integrating dissimilar materials to facilitate multi-functional components/products, broaden the number of 3D printed applications, and increase market size. Active collaboration with industry partners will ensure relevance to education and training of the future workforce to expedite the adoption and integration of 3D printing methods into manufacturing processes. The three institutions will create a scholarship fund specifically for the recruitment of diverse graduate students. A portion of this scholarship fund will be directed to underrepresented students from minority serving institutions, including community colleges. Educational programs associated with this IUCRC target undergraduate and graduate students at GT and local community colleges, K-12 students, and industry professionals. The GT site will work closely with GT?s Center for Engineering Education and Diversity (CEED) graduate fellow program to enhance diversity. Integration of materials research and education will be developed in collaboration with partners, such as Institute of Materials, GT Manufacturing Institute, and GT Polymer Network. The GT site will also work closely with the Research Experience for Student Veterans in Advanced Manufacturing and Entrepreneurship (REVAMP) REU site to train undergraduate students in fundamental principles of advanced manufacturing, with a focus on veterans and minority students. In addition, the GT site will disseminate the research results to K6-12 students through school teachers in metro Atlanta area by NSF research experience for teacher (RET) program.<br/><br/>The SHAP3D Center will perform research to understand the synthesis, properties, and processing of heterogeneous materials for integration into complex, additively manufactured products.  The work SHAP3D envisions would encompass many different additive printing methods, such as fused deposition modeling (FDM), selective laser sintering (SLS), stereolithography (SLA), poly/ink jet, and other additive approaches. The Center will perform fundamental material modeling and processing research to establish and translate validated materials and processes to students and practitioners. The proposed center will enable: (i) the rational design and creation of new material feedstocks and, (ii) the understanding of material properties, protocols, and design rules that must be characterized and developed to optimize the process and predict the properties of products and parts created from multiple polymer materials (e.g., different constituent materials, fillers/additives, and interfaces). GT has extensive expertise and longstanding experience in manufacturing, materials, electronics design and packaging, device fabrication and characterization, and biomedicine. GT will draw on a diverse team of faculty from Mechanical, Materials, Industrial, Chemical, Electrical Engineering Schools. Faculty members from this team will make contributions to the next generation of 3D printed functional multi-materials for functional products with research focused on materials, processes, design, and simulation."

The TTL extends from about 14 to 18.5km over the tropics and is above the tops of all but the tallest convective clouds.  It often contains thin cirrus clouds which, though difficult to see, play an outsized role in trapping outgoing radiation and thus warming the troposphere.  It is sometimes called the ""gateway to the stratosphere"" because most of the water vapor in the stratosphere, and many other stratospheric constituents, enter the stratosphere by moving upward through the TTL.  The stratosphere is extremely dry compared to the troposphere, but stratospheric water vapor is of interest because it has an important greenhouse effect and can lead to the formation of polar stratospheric clouds which play a role in ozone hole formation.<br/><br/>This project seeks to improve understanding of TTL processes by building and launching several instruments on balloons intended to fly at the top of the TTL.  The balloons are part of the Strateole-2 field campaign organized by the Centre National d'Etudes Spatiales (CNES), the French Space Agency, and the Laboratoire de Meteorologie Dynamic (LMD) of the University of Paris-Saclay.  Strateole-2 is a five-year campaign, with a small validation deployment in 2018 and full science deployments in 2020-2021 and 2022-2023.  Balloons are launched  from the Seychelles (about 5S in the Indian Ocean), with the expectation that each balloon will circle the earth for up to 90 days and observe the TTL between 20S and 15N. This award supports US participation in the validation campaign and the first full science deployment, along with post-campaign analysis.  It is one of three awards made to US PIs for participation in Strateole-2, the full set being AGS-1643022, AGS-1642277/1642246, and AGS-1642650/1653644.<br/><br/>One instrument to be built and deployed is an optical particle detector referred to as the LASP Particle Counter (LPC, named after the Laboratory for Atmospheric and Space Physics at the University of Colorado). The LPC uses scattered laser light to detect aerosol particles with sizes ranging from 0.3 to 10 microns and is used to estimate the flux of aerosols entering the stratosphere through the top of the TTL.  In addition to the LPC the PIs are developing an instrument package called RACHuTS, for Reel-down Aerosol Cloud Humidity and Temperature Sensor.  The RACHuTS package weighs less than 2kg and is suspended from a nylon cable which is reeled down to 2km below the balloon gondola and then reeled back up again, each time generating a vertical profile of TTL conditions over 15 minutes. RACHuTS is lowered and raised 5 times each night while the balloon is aloft (the optical components do not function in daylight). The instruments integrated into RACHuTS are developed elsewhere.  These include the Compact Optical Backscatter Aerosol Detector (COBALD, developed at ETH Zurich), the Fluorescence Advanced Stratospheric Hygrometer for Balloon (FLASH-B, developed at the Central Aerological Observatory in Moscow), and the Thermodynamic SENsor (TSEN, developed at LMD). A commercial radiosonde package is also used to record atmospheric pressure and GPS position.<br/><br/>One issue to be addressed in the project is the extent to which supersaturation is an important consideration in determining how much water vapor passes through the TTL and enters the stratosphere.  The amount of water vapor entering the stratosphere is limited by the temperature minimum at the tropopause, under the assumption that the amount of water vapor above that level cannot exceed the amount corresponding to 100% relative humidity at that level.  But it is possibly for relative humidity to exceed 100% in cases where ice particle concentrations are low enough and ascent is fast enough to allow moisture to reach the stratosphere before sublimation can occur.  The RACHuTS instruments are well suited to the study of supersaturation effects as temperature, humidity, and ice particle concentrations are observed together over a substantial portion of the depth of the TTL.  A further issue, to be addressed using the LPC, is the transport of primary aerosols into the stratosphere.  The PIs seek to constrain the size distribution of these areosols and address questions related to the stability of the distribution, its geographical variability, its relationship to convective overshooting, and previous observations of large particles with low number concentrations.<br/><br/>The work has scientific broader impacts due to the value of the observations for addressing a variety of questions regarding TTL processes.  RACHuTS and LPC observations will be made available to the research community from servers at LASP so that it can be freely examined by the research community.  In addition, the project constitutes a demonstration of a novel technology for meteorological observations which could have a wide array of scientific applications.  Beyond these considerations, the project supports a postdoctoral research associate, thereby developing the future scientific workforce in this research area."

These light-matter hybrid states, known as polaritons, have emergent properties that do not exist in the separate components alone. This research harnesses the duality of polaritons to design ways in which light-matter interactions may be exploited to obtain novel ways to manipulate transport of charge and light-harvested energy. Typically, energy captured from sunlight moves across a molecular antenna in the form of excitons, neutral nanoscale excitations transported across molecules. Understanding and controlling exciton transport in molecular materials is a significant challenge for the theory of condensed phases physics and chemistry, as well as a primary concern for studies of photosynthesis and new light-harvesting technologies, such as organic solar cells. This project trains graduate students and postdoctoral fellows to be conversant on research at the intersection of theoretical chemistry, nano-photonics, and condensed matter theory. It also develops a broad outreach plan to school students via a series of performance choreographies mimicking collective phenomena in topological materials. Dr. Yuen-Zhou is also involved in developing a new orientation strategy to accommodate the increasing international graduate student population in his department at UCSD.<br/><br/><br/>Polaritons inherit wavelike properties from light such as extended spatial coherence, but also matter properties which allow energy to localize energy and give rise to a chemical reaction or to strong interactions between charged particles. This research harnesses the duality of polaritons to design ways in which light-matter interaction interact to produce phenomena that do not occur via each of the components alone.  An example of this is enhanced charge transport or topologically-protected energy transport in the nano- and mesoscales. Here, topological refers to properties that do not require fine-tuning of parameters to survive, but rather, rely on global characteristics which are robust to material imperfections and impurities. This investigation focuses on the unusually delocalized exciton states of molecular polaritons. By noting that dipolar light-matter interaction is anisotropic and isomorphic to spin-orbit coupling, the research harnesses the latter to induce exotic polaritonic effects akin to those found in topological insulators, giving rise to spatial and directional control of nano- and mesoscale energy flow which is robust to disorder. These ideas are first tested on purely excitonic systems of porphyrin arrays and then on similar systems of chromophores in confined electromagnetic environments. Analogies to Dirac systems in two-dimensional materials such as graphene prove fruitful and give rise to unexplored frontiers of molecular aggregates. The Yuen-Zhou group also addresses recent observations suggesting that confined electromagnetic fields can enhance the conductivity of organic polymers owing to the formation of delocalized polaritons, opening new avenues for control of electron transport in molecular materials. Even though the project is theoretical in nature, it has a strong spectroscopic component aimed at simulating measurements that experimentalists might produce. Collaborations with experimentalists are a strong component of the work.  Yuen-Zhou and coworkers are providing the first theoretical and computational framework to describe the interplay between topological band structures and vibronic degrees of freedom, including the deleterious or beneficial effects of vibrational decoherence.  They are also studying a comprehensive theory for polaritons-assisted charge transport. These studies provide insights on the limits of controllability of energy and charge flow in the nano- and mesoscales, as well as new paradigms for the design light-harvesting technologies and optical logic devices. The development of the scientific component is accompanied by the training of graduate students and postdoctoral fellows in an interdisciplinary environment. Upon completion of their work, trainees are prepared to face a wide variety of contemporary scientific challenges, both in academic and industrial settings. The project also includes a multifaceted educational project with the goal of popularizing abstract concepts of topological phases of matter to a broad audience. This consists of a series of experiential and interpretative dance events termed Top-Dances, where high-school students participate in collective choreographies that aim to recreate energy and charge transport in quasi-two-dimensional materials such as those addressed in the project. These events are recorded, analyzed, digested in the events, and distributed in social media to provide alternative and intuitive ways to visualize the aforementioned concepts. Finally, as a response to the recent rise of international graduate students in the Department of Chemistry and Biochemistry of UCSD, Professor Yuen-Zhou also redesigns an orientation program with the goal of fostering a more effective integration of these students into a challenging academic and research environment. This goal is carried out through a series of workshops addressing issues of academic leadership and diversity, as well as the installation of a mentoring support network within the department."

The project has potential to speed and scale these types of applications on a variety of hardware platforms. The correctness assurance of these applications is enhances by having a variety of implementation variants for different platforms automatically generated, while allowing a single easy-to-maintain version of the software being used as the source for the different implementation variants.  These ""automatically improved"" applications can, in turn, enable better knowledge discovery through larger-scale scientific simulations and machine learning, and potentially improve the quality of people's daily lives through better GPS routing and natural language processing implementations.<br/><br/>This I-Corps project will explore the commercial viability of a system that automatically produces efficient implementation variants of computer software on a variety of different hardware platforms.  A graphical user interface is used to permit users to interactively specify the desired application features, provide knowledge about the application source code, and select the appropriate hardware platforms.  The project is unique in its interface for supporting interactive communications among software developers, compiler optimizations, and performance tuning of optimizations for varying platforms. While the existing state-of-the-art largely treats compilers as black boxes that optimize a given software application for a single desired hardware platform, this project packages compiler technologies as a collection of optimization tool sets to be used interactively by developers so that optimizations can be applied at a much finer-grained level, specially customized to suit the needs of each application, and better tuned to exploit the varying capabilities of hardware platforms."

In particular, two dominant theories have emerged that explain how mountain belts evolve in response to subduction of oceanic crust beneath continental crust. These theories argue for either protracted mountain building, or an episodic model in which topography repeatedly rises and falls due to crustal shortening and removal of lithosphere beneath a subducting arc. The southern Patagonian Andes provides a natural laboratory for evaluating the drivers of long-term topographic change in a classic Cordilleran Orogen. This study aims to quantify the elevation history of the Southern Patagonia Andes for the last 100 million years to test these competing theories for Cordilleran mountain building. Results will improve understanding about how subduction processes shape the Earth's surface and will have broad implications for understanding current and past seismic activity, hazards, and resources. In addition, insight into changes in the ancient environment will shed light on how evolution of large mountain belts influences plants and animals over millions of years. A new Augmented Reality exhibit at the Yale University Peabody Museum will enable countless visitors to virtually explore how mountains influence precipitation and illustrate important concepts in atmospheric processes and geomorphology. Other important societal outcomes include providing support for an early career faculty researcher and broadening participation in an important STEM discipline through graduate and undergraduate recruiting.<br/><br/>There has been a long debate about punctuated versus steady orogeny. In particular, two opposing ideas argue for either protracted orogenesis or an episodic ""Cordilleran cycle"" in which topography repeatedly rises and falls due to crustal shortening and convective removal of sub-arc lithosphere. The large Cordilleran orogens (e.g. Sierra Nevada, Cascades, Southern Andes) all host massive granitic batholiths that formed from the partial melting of the sub-arc mantle and the migration of silicic melts through the upper crust. This project explores the idea that emplacement of granitic batholiths was the primary driver of topography in the Patagonian Andes and other Cordilleran orogens. The proposed work will reconstruct the Cretaceous to recent stable isotopic composition of paleoprecipitation on the windward and leeward side of the Patagonian Andes to test competing hypotheses for the formation of Cordilleran-style orogens. Volcanic glasses, soil carbonates and sedimentary leaf waxes from several well-dated Cretaceous to recent sedimentary basins will be sampled to reconstruct precipitation deltaD and delta18O. Isotope data will be coupled with a numerical atmospheric physics model with high-resolution water isotope fields to constrain the timing and spatial heterogeneity of topographic change in the Patagonian Andes. The isotope-enabled numerical model deals with observed complexities in the behavior of airflow and produces realistic representation of modern distribution of precipitation isotopes on the scale of an orogen. This approach enables separation of climatic and topographic effects on precipitation isotopes and more accurate reconstructions of topographic change."

Previous research on energy perception has not produced a sufficiently clear picture of how people gauge personal and societal energy consumption. The goal of this project is to transform the methodological and theoretical frameworks for characterizing and correcting perception of household and nationwide energy use. The researcher teams collects data from energy experts as well as novices in order to identify differences in how experts versus novices conceptualize energy systems and energy consumption. These differences among conceptual models helps to develop messages to correct the way novices understand energy use and energy systems. In short, this project leads to new understanding of the perception of energy use, of how misperceptions can be corrected, and of the role of good system understanding in shaping public perception of how best to conserve energy in the home and nationwide.                                              <br/><br/>There are two main research questions: [A] How do expert and novice mental models of energy use differ? and [B] What methods are effective in correcting misperceptions of energy use? To answer the first question, experiments identify what kinds of expertise that predict accurate perceptions of (1) small- and (2) large-scale energy use, (3) investigate what heuristics or causal reasons are used to make these estimates, and (4) identify the similarity structure among appliance categories. In [B], studies correct misperceptions identified in [A] by creating and testing methods for helping novices construct mental models and heuristics more similar to those used by experts. This project is distinct from most work on scientific explanations in that the primary relevant context (energy use estimation) is highly quantifiable and lies on a single scale. This property allows the researchers uniquely to combine psychophysics, heuristics, and causal explanations--three important but previously largely separate fields of cognitive psychology--and to bring the combination to bear on a complex real-world problem. Project findings contribute to new methods and theories for assessing and correcting energy perception. Based on the research results, the team will create an online open-access training tool that will increase public scientific literacy about energy and will support enhanced public engagement with science and technology."

They occur in high mountain areas in North America, and little is known about their biology and evolution. Because of their unique habit of living in areas near alpine glaciers, which constantly expand and retract, ice-crawlers are a natural model to study the long-term consequences of climate variation. This research will explore two major, and so far largely unanswered questions: How does climate influence the diversity and diversification of species? And: How do species change their physiological tolerance in response to climate over time? Results from this research will greatly increase our general understanding of adaptive responses of species to changing environments. This research will be complemented by outreach efforts to the public at U.S. National Parks, the training of high school and university students, as well as the development of inquiry-based science curricula involving insects that may be implemented in middle schools.<br/><br/>The scientific aim of this proposal is to test the importance of geographical isolation and climatic niche evolution in the generation of montane biodiversity, thus advancing knowledge of the mechanisms that generate high levels of endemism in montane ecosystems. Montane lineage diversity increased in response to Pliocene-Pleistocene glaciations, but it is not clear whether climatic niche evolution played a role in the persistence and diversification of montane taxa. Indeed, geographical isolation and niche conservatism are considered the primary mechanisms of climate-driven lineage diversification in montane regions. This proposed research would collect genomic data and provide a comprehensive phylogeny for the entire insect order Grylloblattodea, an understudied lineage in the insect tree of life. Additionally, biogeographic and diversification rate analyses would test the role of climate fluctuations in generating ice-crawler diversity. Ecophysiological data, including thermal tolerance, thermal preference, and water loss rates, will be compared in taxon pairs occurring in sympatry, across environmental gradients, and in allopatry. Collectively, these analyses will test whether niche evolution, as opposed to phylogenetic conservatism, contribute to montane diversity. This research would make progress on a major goal of evolutionary and ecological research, that is to understand how rates of ecological divergence vary across regions and taxonomic groups, as well as the conditions under which lineages undergo adaptive radiations. The results will be published in peer-reviewed journals and presented at scientific meetings."

The additive manufacturing industry exceeds $5 billion in 2015 and is expected to top $20 billion within the next five years. It has become an extremely competitive area of research in countries around the world. To ensure US' global leadership in this emerging field originated from the US, academic partners (currently including Georgia Institute of Technology (GT), University of Connecticut (UConn), and University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML)) have come together to create the Center for Science of Heterogeneous Additive Printing of 3D Materials (SHAP3D). SHAP3D will serve the diverse interests of industry, government, and academia by addressing fundamental research challenges to meet the commercial needs of industry for 3D printing of heterogeneous materials. SHAP3D will develop the critical and necessary insight into fundamental processing-structure-property relationships to predict and control the integration of diverse materials for 3D printing. The work of SHAP3D will be critical as the industry adopts 3D printing for product prototyping, tooling, and higher volume manufacturing with three specific economic outcomes. First, the Center will pursue higher performance materials and composites that enable diverse and lighter weight products to minimize total life cycle costs and environmental footprint. Second, in order to minimize processing costs, the Center will explore more optimal and parallel processes to more quickly print products with higher resolution. Third, SHAP3D will investigate interfacial physics and design concepts for integrating dissimilar materials to facilitate multi-functional components/products, broaden the number of 3D printed applications, and increase market size. Active collaboration with industry partners will ensure relevance to education and training of the future workforce to expedite the adoption and integration of 3D printing methods into manufacturing processes. The three institutions will create a scholarship fund specifically for the recruitment of diverse graduate students. A portion of this scholarship fund will be directed to underrepresented students from minority serving institutions, including community colleges. A large number of companies in Connecticut supporting the aerospace and shipbuilding sectors will benefit from the I/UCRC. UConn?s Additive Manufacturing Innovation Center (AMIC) has introduced state-of-the-art additive manufacturing to over 120 companies and government agencies. Faculty members affiliated with this I/UCRC have also participated in many well-established outreach programs targeting students, industry, and the general public. For instance, an additive manufacturing workshop was held at UConn in 2015 in collaboration with non-profit &#8232;Connecticut Youth Forum. This Forum empowers over 700 urban, suburban and rural youth through civil dialogue, service learning, and leadership development activities. With the support of this award, the UConn team will work closely with the Engineering Diversity Program and student-led 3D Printing Club at UConn to initiate new educational outreach programs, especially targeting high schools in inner city Hartford and Willimantic with high minority populations. In addition to offering industry workshops and relevant projects through existing NSF REU and BRIDGE programs, the UConn team will also coordinate with local industry partners and professional organizations to create new senior design projects and co-op/internship opportunities.<br/><br/>The SHAP3D Center will perform research to understand the synthesis, properties, and processing of heterogeneous materials for integration into complex, additively manufactured products.  The work SHAP3D envisions would encompass many different additive printing methods, such as fused deposition modeling (FDM), selective laser sintering (SLS), stereolithography (SLA), poly/ink jet, and other additive approaches. The Center will perform fundamental material modeling and processing research to establish and translate validated materials and processes to students and practitioners. The proposed center will enable: (i) the rational design and creation of new material feedstocks and, (ii) the understanding of material properties, protocols, and design rules that must be characterized and developed to optimize the process and predict the properties of products and parts created from multiple polymer materials (e.g., different constituent materials, fillers/additives, and interfaces). The proposed technical activities at UConn will draw from the existing strengths of the School of Engineering (SoE) and the Institute of Materials Science (IMS). The four thrust areas are: (i) additive manufacturing of soft materials and integration with metallic and/or ceramic materials, (ii) flexible hybrid electronics, (iii) multifunctional composites&#8232; for aerospace and biological applications, and (iv) scalable nano-manufacturing. These areas will be further supported by interdisciplinary faculty teams with deep knowledge in materials science, machinery, computations and simulations, big data processing, and machine learning. Of particular focus is multi-material 3D printing, which further enables the synergistic use of polymers and non-polymers in ways that best suit a specific application, maximizing the broader impact."

Several archaeological studies have indicated that pastoralism, in conjunction with hunter-gatherer-fisher strategies, persisted for several millennia. Thus, a detailed investigation of the role that early pastoralist orientations played within traditional hunter-gatherer-fisher subsistence systems contributes importantly to anthropological studies on the origins of multi-resource pastoralism and the part this played in broader social, cultural and political complexity.  Within this broader context, and under the supervision of Dr. Bryan Hanks of the University of Pittsburgh, doctoral candidate Chuenyan Ng will investigate multi-resource pastoralism strategies used by late prehistoric steppe communities at the Bronze Age settlement of Stepnoye (2100-1500 BC) located in the Southeastern Urals region of Russia. The long-standing subsistence model for these communities has been defined as a sedentary agro-pastoral strategy with dominant use of livestock. However, based on recent studies, the nature and variability of the subsistence economy, especially wild plant resource exploitation for both human and livestock, are not well understood. Within sedentary pastoral communities the relationship between increasing livestock productivity and decreasing risk associated with resource sustainability is a continuous process. It is achieved only through control of land for grazing, regulations of the composition and size of herds, and the establishment of seasonal herding strategies including foddering. Did multi-resource pastoralism and catchment resource sustainability influence the development of these communities? To address this question, this project will develop a new model for local human-environmental relationships to better understand multi-resource pastoralism as an important economic component of these communities. . A broader contribution of the research is reflected in the important and productive collaborative relationships that have been developed with Russian institutions, faculty and students.<br/><br/>This project will undertake a systematic archaeobotanical and phytogeographical study of subsistence patterns among late prehistoric pastoralist communities. The multi-disciplinary approach draws productively from ethnographic, anthropological, and archaeological evidence, to examine relationships between ancient settlements, local site catchments, and the emergence of new forms of livestock herding that integrated with earlier traditions of hunting, gathering and fishing. A combination of detailed macro-botanical study, experimental archaeology, and computer simulation modeling through Geographic Information System software will produce a new model for understanding early traditions of multi-resource pastoralism. This research will contribute importantly to regional studies of the Sintashta culture and provide an important comparative case study for understanding key transitions among sedentary pastoralist societies with multi-resource subsistence economiesThis project will establish a detailed archaeobotanical database and computer simulation socio-ecnomic model that will provide a crucial foundation for future studies of late prehistoric subsistence patterns and pastoralist lifeways in the Eurasian steppes."

In particular, two dominant theories have emerged that explain how mountain belts evolve in response to subduction of oceanic crust beneath continental crust. These theories argue for either protracted mountain building, or an episodic model in which topography repeatedly rises and falls due to crustal shortening and removal of lithosphere beneath a subducting arc. The southern Patagonian Andes provides a natural laboratory for evaluating the drivers of long-term topographic change in a classic Cordilleran Orogen. This study aims to quantify the elevation history of the Southern Patagonia Andes for the last 100 million years to test these competing theories for Cordilleran mountain building. Results will improve understanding about how subduction processes shape the Earth's surface and will have broad implications for understanding current and past seismic activity, hazards, and resources. In addition, insight into changes in the ancient environment will shed light on how evolution of large mountain belts influences plants and animals over millions of years. A new Augmented Reality exhibit at the Yale University Peabody Museum will enable countless visitors to virtually explore how mountains influence precipitation and illustrate important concepts in atmospheric processes and geomorphology. Other important societal outcomes include providing support for an early career faculty researcher and broadening participation in an important STEM discipline through graduate and undergraduate recruiting.<br/><br/>There has been a long debate about punctuated versus steady orogeny. In particular, two opposing ideas argue for either protracted orogenesis or an episodic ""Cordilleran cycle"" in which topography repeatedly rises and falls due to crustal shortening and convective removal of sub-arc lithosphere. The large Cordilleran orogens (e.g. Sierra Nevada, Cascades, Southern Andes) all host massive granitic batholiths that formed from the partial melting of the sub-arc mantle and the migration of silicic melts through the upper crust. This project explores the idea that emplacement of granitic batholiths was the primary driver of topography in the Patagonian Andes and other Cordilleran orogens. The proposed work will reconstruct the Cretaceous to recent stable isotopic composition of paleoprecipitation on the windward and leeward side of the Patagonian Andes to test competing hypotheses for the formation of Cordilleran-style orogens. Volcanic glasses, soil carbonates and sedimentary leaf waxes from several well-dated Cretaceous to recent sedimentary basins will be sampled to reconstruct precipitation deltaD and delta18O. Isotope data will be coupled with a numerical atmospheric physics model with high-resolution water isotope fields to constrain the timing and spatial heterogeneity of topographic change in the Patagonian Andes. The isotope-enabled numerical model deals with observed complexities in the behavior of airflow and produces realistic representation of modern distribution of precipitation isotopes on the scale of an orogen. This approach enables separation of climatic and topographic effects on precipitation isotopes and more accurate reconstructions of topographic change."

Abandoned mine waste sites, many of which are located in Native American communities, remain inadequately managed in the United States; the occurrence and mobility of metals in such communities are poorly understood. Mine wastes can be used as sources of scarce precious metals for modern societal demands. Results from this project will help guide reclamation strategies with recovered materials potentially benefiting affected communities. Partnership with Native American communities in New Mexico will facilitate information exchange, access to sites, and collaborative training opportunities for students.<br/><br/>The PI will investigate changes in U speciation and accumulation in organic-rich sediments by integrating ex-situ and in-situ spectroscopy, microscopy, and synchrotron-based real-time experiments. This fundamental knowledge will open new possibilities for future reclamation strategies to integrate remediation with metal recovery processing from mine wastes using local resources. The research objectives of this project are to: 1) quantify the dissolution rate of U-organic matter, uranium-phosphorus (U-P), uranium-vanadium (U-V), and U-oxide bearing minerals from abandoned mine wastes after exposure to surface oxidizing laboratory conditions; 2) determine how the interfacial interaction between aqueous U and organic-rich sediments affects U redox and binding with organic matter functional groups in solids by integrating X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), synchrotron based real time X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), and aqueous chemistry measurements; and 3) identify the governing mechanisms that affect the accumulation of U in plants at the interface of water and organic-rich sediments. The education objectives are to: 1) develop an educational approach to effectively communicate scientific outcomes related to potential health hazards associated with metals present in abandoned mine wastes to Native American communities; 2) develop a training program to increase participation and empowerment of Native American students to engage in Environmental Science and Engineering; and 3) present relevant scientific activities and findings of the URANIUM project at the New Mexico Museum for Natural History & Science to raise awareness of the legacy of abandoned mine wastes for K-12 students and general audiences. The outcomes of this project will directly impact Native American communities in New Mexico and have implications for other sites worldwide confronting the legacy of abandoned mine wastes."

Venous thrombosis, comprising deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), occurs with an incidence of approximately 1 per 1000 annually in adult populations. Estimates suggest that 60k -100k Americans die of DVT/PE (also called venous thromboembolism). The current treatments are high risk to the patients and very expensive to the health care systems. Current treatment methods involve the use of systemic or catheter-directed thrombolytic medications to break down the clot and restore blood flow. The use of these medications carries the risk of bleeding in different parts of the body which can lead to death. Open-heart surgery is another treatment method, but the high risk of this critical surgery requires highly skilled physicians and advanced equipment that may not be available in most hospitals. The proposed device is simple and intuitive and allows the physicians to complete the treatment and restore the blood flow in less than 30 minutes of the patient arrival while other treatment methods take several hours for mechanical thrombectomy and several days for catheter-delivered thrombolysis. This will significantly reduce the total procedure cost by reducing the length of stay in the intensive care unit from the average of 2-3 days to only a few hours. <br/><br/>The proposed project advances the current of the art of Nitinol medical device design, fabrication, and evaluation. The proposed clot removal device targets pulmonary embolism which is a common disease and may lead to death. The proposing team has established the technologies and know-how to produce the core Nitinol components of device. These include a simulation-based design optimization methodology, which has been used for the design of the main blood clot capturing funnels from Nitinol. The team has established innovative non-conventional fabrication and post-processing heat treatment procedures. Based on the anatomy and functionality of the circulation system an innovative test set up has been fabricated that can replicate the blockage of arteries. To this end, human blood clots are created and inserted in the test apparatus for a later retrieval. One of the main innovations is a Nitinol structure designed to allow for a 7-fold increase in the diameter of the blood capturing device when deployed: when deployed these Nitinol elements can expand from 2mm to 14mm in diameter, without any balloon or other external force. This innovative functionality has never been achieved before and is essential for the atraumatic functionality of the proposed device. This has been achieved by developing a mathematical method to systematically calculate the shape and size of laser cutting feature on a tube of Nitinol. With proper heat treatment, this tube can be formed to produce the two capturing baskets. The team has also used additive manufacturing and advanced computer simulation to create a test setup for in vitro testing of the capturing device."

Citizen CATE is a program to observe the total solar eclipse that will track across the United States on August 21, 2017 from 60 locations distributed along the path of totality.  Total solar eclipse crossings of the United States are relatively rare events; the last time a total solar eclipse crossed the Continental U.S. from the Atlantic to the Pacific was June 18, 1918.  While a total solar eclipse lasts only a few minutes at any one particular location, Citizen CATE will have 60 identical sites manned by trained citizen-science volunteers. The goal of the experiment is to produce a continuous white-light movie of the inner solar corona for a period of about 90 minutes.  The resulting data set will provide a scientific resource to further study the dynamics of the corona, and an educational resource for the training of future researchers and for outreach to the general public.   The academic partners that will be involved in the Citizen CATE experiment are drawn from a geographically and demographically diverse set of institutions.  These diverse partners will, in turn, reach out to an even broader audience from small rural events to international broadcasts viewed by thousands.  <br/><br/>Never before have the continuous observations of the inner solar corona like those proposed by the Citizen CATE project been performed.  Some of the areas of solar research that will be addressed by such a data set include:  the study of polar plume dynamics, measurement of the coronal potential field, examination of the relationship between coronal smoke rings and Rayleigh-Taylor instabilities, the search for active-region loop oscillations, and the search for the signatures of coronal inflows.  After the eclipse, the CATE data will be transmitted back to a central location at the PIs institution, the National Solar Observatory in Boulder, CO, for further processing and distribution to the scientific community for further research.  A quick-look movie of the Citizen CATE results will also be made available to the general public on the day of the eclipse.  The CATE data will open a new window on the inner solar corona and will provide valuable context data for future eclipse studies.  Because the equipment that is used by the volunteers for the eclipse observations will stay with the institutions, the project will have lasting effects on STEM education well beyond the 2017 event.  Students from across the country will be engaged in solar physics and astronomy research and education.  The project will, thus, serve to inspire and train the next generation of astronomers."

One of the useful byproducts of anaerobic processes is methane gas, which can be utilized as a fuel. This research combines two important biogeochemical cycles - the nitrogen and carbon cycles - and two important contaminants - methane and nitrogen - in surface waters. This project will contribute to solving one of the National Academy of Engineering Grand Challenges of the 21st century, managing the nitrogen cycle.<br/><br/>Recent findings suggest that methane oxidation is possible in oxygen-free conditions with nitrite and nitrate as the electron acceptors, referred to as denitrifying anoxic methane oxidation. Denitrifying anoxic methane oxidation is ecologically significant because it connects two important ecosystem cycles - the nitrogen and carbon cycles. The role of denitrifying anoxic methane oxidation organisms cannot be ignored; these organisms contribute to the sink of methane in ecosystems as well as to the nitrogen dynamics in nitrogen-contaminated ecosystems. Recent findings related to denitrifying anoxic methane oxidation involve an addition to the biochemistry of prokaryotes-mediated methane oxidation and have generated further possibilities for research, such as an evaluation of their role on a global scale, their ecological diversity, and their actual role in methane sinks. The enzyme nitric oxide dismutase is involved in the splitting of nitric oxide (2NO=N2+O2) to generate oxygen for the particulate methane monooxygenase to oxidize methane gas. Based on the metagenome construction of M. oxyfera and preliminary stable isotope labeled experiments, it was hypothesized that M. oxyfera is capable of dismutating NO to N2 and O2. Absolutely no information is available on nitric oxide dismutase. On a broader scale, the ecological significance of denitrifying anoxic methane oxidation organisms, the actual scale of methane sinks due to denitrifying anoxic methane oxidation, and the in-situ factors affecting denitrifying anoxic methane oxidation are not fully understood. The potential of using denitrifying anoxic methane oxidation organisms for nitrogen management in wastewater treatment plants has been explored fully with well-planned operational strategies. In this EAGER award, the PI will study the role of the nitric oxide dismutase gene and determine whether studies of this gene could provide a breakthrough in understanding the ecology of denitrifying anoxic methane oxidation organisms. The PI will study the nitrogen removal potential of denitrifying anoxic methane oxidation organisms while working synergistically with other N-cycling bacteria in wastewater treatment. The intellectual merit of this research includes: (1) elucidating whether denitrification-coupled anoxic methane oxidation (denitrifying anoxic methane oxidation) is a key sink of methane in nitrogen-contaminated ecosystems, (2) revealing the identity of denitrifying anoxic methane oxidation organisms using metagenomics and metatranscriptomics, and, (3) developing a new tool to study the presence and diversity of denitrifying anoxic methane oxidation organisms. This project will lay the foundation for further investigation and incorporation of denitrifying anoxic methane oxidation in ecological models aimed at estimating methane emissions. The fundamental knowledge gained in this research will be applicable in other natural (contaminated subsurface and river sediments) and engineered (engineered bioreactors) systems. The project will directly contribute to graduate and undergraduate education. The PI has developed computer animations to demonstrate, for example, how viruses infect bacteria. In this project, the PI will further expand this outreach to include well-illustrated short films to demonstrate laboratory protocols, the significance of the nitrogen cycle, and greenhouse gas emissions. Results will be disseminated through peer-reviewed publications and community workshops for local wetland managers."

Previous research has demonstrated that strong community ties are linked to civic efficacy, participation, cooperation, and volunteering, and are, therefore, an important measure of social well-being. But recently, researchers have observed dramatic increases in social heterogeneity, weakening ties and potentially underming trust within and between communities.  The workshop asks if these developments are inevitable and what the outcomes will be. It addresses these questions using a comparative, community studies approach.  Social scientists from the United States, Mexico, Norway, Spain, and the United Kingdom will use anthropological ethnographic and archival data to examine current shifts in how communities are formed, how they change, and the kinds of ties that are formed within and between them. The work will have impact by 1) increasing understanding of the causes and consequences of community change in the contemporary world; 2) supporting international research collaboration; and 3) promoting education through the inclusion of graduate student participants and by communicating results to the public.<br/><br/>The two-part workshop will be convened by Dr. Jeff Maskovsky (City University of New York) and Dr. Sophie Bjork-James (Vanderbilt University).  Community studies experts will share data on how communities across the world are changing and whether those changes strengthen or weaken social ties.  The first workshop will seek to answer multiple, interrelated questions: From global perspectives, what are the primary influencers of community change? What social factors have the most impact in strengthening or weakening community ties? How does increased diversity affect community ties?  And what can ethnography and history contribute to current debates?  The workshop will emphasize a comparative perspective and will develop knowledge of community change across regional, national, international, and global contexts. The second workshop will distill findings and prepare for the publication of an edited volume designed to reach four high impact audiences: students in graduate and undergraduate anthropology courses, anthropologists studying community change, scholars in other disciplines working on similar topics, and the English language reading public."

This understanding has relevance for modern day climate and also for global-scale carbon budgets.  The relevance to modern day climate is related to the Paleocence/Eocene thermal maximum, a period of rapid atmospheric warming, thought to be the best ancient analogue to rapid present-day warming.  The Paleocence/Eocene event is hypothesized to have been driven by the rapid and voluminous release of carbon from sediments intruded by igneous sills during a regionally large magmatic event around the time of the opening of the North Atlantic between Greenland and Europe.  Defining relationships between igneous sill intrusion into sediments and carbon release from those sediments into the ocean and potentially the atmosphere will help place bounds on the volume of carbon available to create the rapid warming under the sill hypothesis and can be compared to modern atmospheric carbon inputs.  In addition, many active magmatic systems exist in the present day that involve sill intrusion into organic-rich sediments, units that have generally been thought of as stable carbon sinks.  Broader impacts of the work include understanding the reintroduction of carbon into the ocean and potentially into the atmosphere from sediments in these magmatic systems, something that is presently missing from global carbon cycle models. An additional impact is the support of a drilling leg of the International Ocean Discovery Program, a major NSF and international investment in understanding how the Earth system behaves by drilling into the seafloor and examining the rocks and sediments and their stratigraphy and lithologic relationships. <br/><br/><br/>The research will analyze a new high-resolution multi-channel seismic dataset from Guaymas Basin in the Gulf of California in order to advance our understanding of the processes of sediment alteration in response to igneous sill intrusion.  The work has two main goals: (1) integration of the new high-resolution data into analyses based on lower-frequency 6-kilometer streamer seismic data aimed at quantifying relationships between igneous sill thickness and alteration of overlying sediments. The new data will enable us to confidently identify sills as thin as 12m and evaluate potential drilling sites for the proposed International Ocean Discovery Program in the Guaymas Basin. These new data are the first that look at the second dimension of the crust in the area of the proposed main drill sites and potential alternate sites.  Processes driven by the intrusion of igneous sills into sediments during regionally extensive magmatic episodes are increasingly being invoked as triggers for extinction events and global-scale changes in oceanic and atmospheric chemistry.  These hypotheses are largely founded on changes in the carbon content of sediments within metamorphic aureoles of igneous sills observed in ancient outcrops and the assumption that carbon and other elements lost from the aureoles are also lost from the entire subsurface system and efficiently released into the ocean or atmosphere.  A key objective of the Guaymas drilling proposal, which this research project supports, is to understand the subsurface and seafloor bio/geochemical cycling of carbon released due to sill intrusion.  A key objective of the present proposal is to further the work of developing seismic proxies for alteration intensity that can extend knowledge, based on drill cores, to regional scales.  Relationships between sill thickness and changes in seismic velocity within overlying sediments may prove to be a useful proxy, and this project will make co-located measurements along existing long-streamer lines in Guaymas Basin with the aid of the new hi-resolution seismic data.  The long-streamer data provide the means to estimate changes in sediment properties (seismic velocity) due to contact metamorphism, while the high-resolution data provide a means to estimate sill thickness, which scales with the available thermal energy of the intrusion."

People report worse sleep after conflict and more conflict after poor sleep. However, little is known about why poor sleep and interpersonal conflict are related or what factors might increase or decrease the connection. Both interpersonal conflict and poor sleep are associated with chronic stress, reduced immune function, shorter lifespan, and lower life satisfaction. They also impose staggering social and economic burdens, costing the nation hundreds of billions of dollars every year and negatively impacting the development of children exposed to parental conflict. Understanding what drives links between conflict and sleep is necessary to reduce these tolls. This research will examine behavioral, emotional, cognitive, and psychophysiological pathways through which sleep and conflict are related over time. It will also test whether poor self-regulation (difficulty adjusting behavior, emotions, and thoughts in response to environmental demands) renders some people more vulnerable to negative links between conflict and sleep. The discovery of how specific relationship processes can promote sleep quality and how aspects of sleep quality can reduce conflict severity and frequency could inform intervention strategies for therapists working with distressed couples. The discovery that self-regulation (a resource that can be strengthened through training and practice) can protect people from these negative effects would advance intervention and prevention, ultimately impacting public health, the economy, and child development.<br/><br/>This multi-method longitudinal study of 200 couples will investigate how observed and self-reported features of conflict are associated with fluctuations in objective and subjective measures of sleep quality over time. The study has three objectives. The first is to determine how partners' behavioral, emotional, and physiological stress responses to a lab-based conflict are associated with their own and each other's typical sleep quality. The second is to determine the direction of links between specific features of conflict and sleep over time, using cross-lagged analysis of dyadic daily diary and sleep assessments collected at home over 14 days. The third objective is to determine whether developmentally organized markers of self-regulation (attachment, heart rate variability, rumination, and post-conflict recovery behavior) moderate links between conflict and sleep over time. This study will contribute to science by advancing a theoretically-derived model of individual differences in interpersonal stress reactivity and regulation that affect behavior in two critically important social contexts. Additionally, this project will provide training for the next generation of STEM scientists by engaging diverse undergraduate women in mentored research and discovery."

This journey is comprised of a series of long-distance non-stop flights that can be 6-8 hours in duration for most songbirds, but could last for days in some shorebirds. During flight, metabolic rate is very high and migratory birds primarily fuel these long flights with stored fat. However, protein breakdown also occurs during flight resulting in dramatic organ and muscle mass reductions.  Such dramatic reductions in muscle and organ mass could result in significant functional losses of organ systems but this has not been thoroughly investigated. This project proposes to investigate the causes, consequences, and mechanisms of protein breakdown during flight in migratory birds. This research will further our insight into the unique metabolism of migratory birds in flight, deepen our understanding of how migratory birds maintain homeostasis despite dramatic reductions in critical organ systems, and will provide novel insight into the molecular and biochemical mechanisms involved in muscle and organ degeneration and regeneration. Additionally, this project will provide a platform to engage many undergraduate and graduate students from diverse backgrounds in integrative research, providing exposure and training in a broad range of cutting edge techniques that will be applicable to many STEM fields. These students will also develop and implement science communication and outreach programming for middle school students in a local low-income school district.<br/><br/>During flight, metabolic rate is 10-fold higher than at rest and rates of water loss are very high, placing extreme demands on the ability of birds to manage water and energy budgets. Migratory birds fuel long-duration flight primarily by the oxidation of fat, but a large amount of protein is also catabolized, resulting in reductions in muscle and organ mass of 20% - 40% from pre-flight levels. However, the functional limits and underlying mechanisms of lean mass catabolism during flight remain unclear. Migratory birds will be flown in a climatically controlled wind tunnel for extended periods to evaluate hypotheses for the causes of protein catabolism, while the consequences and mechanisms of protein catabolism will be assessed by measuring whole animal and tissue level changes in key physiological processes, and by investigating transcriptional differences that occur during flight. This will provide insight into physiological mechanisms that allow the maintenance of homeostasis despite dramatic organ and muscle remodeling, and will further our understanding of the basic mechanisms controlling phenotypic flexibility in vertebrates.  Graduate and undergraduate students will receive integrative training in many cutting-edge techniques as part of this project, which will be broadly applicable to many STEM careers. This research will provide genuine research experiences for many undergraduates with emphasis on providing mentorship and training to encourage women and students from underrepresented groups to further pursue careers in STEM disciplines."

While authorities managing environmental risk seek to earn trust from the public, they also want such trust to be strong. That is, they want trust bestowed upon them to last over time, endure bad news cycles, and positively influence people's thinking and behavior. Research in risk communication, however, rarely has focused on how these strength-related qualities of trust are gained or lost. Little is known about how these qualities can be measured and tested in statistical models. The lack of attention in this area is likely due to how the field has conceptualized trust, usually as a construct that inherently takes minimal cognitive effort, allowing people to make decisions about environmental risk without having to engage in complex calculations. The current project synthesizes theories and findings from multiple disciplines to take an alternative approach. The literature of attitude strength suggests that attitudes crystallized through rich knowledge and elaboration will exhibit consequences indicative of strong attitudes: they will persist over time, resist counter-persuasive messages, and strongly affect further information processing and behavior. To argue that trust is inherently based on effortless processing implies that trust cannot exhibit these strength-related consequences. Instead of dismissing the possibility of trust based on cognitively effortful processes, this research examines how communication processes can increase knowledge and elaboration about risk managers which, in turn, can yield stronger forms of trust. <br/><br/>This new research propose a theoretical model to study attitude strength attributes of trust in risk communication. According to this model, two attitude-strength attributes (knowledge, elaboration) mediate the relationship between three communication process antecedents (direct interaction, media usage, and discussion with others) and four attitude strength consequences (persistence, resistance, impact on information processing, impact on behavior). To empirically test this alternative model of trust, the projects develops a two-wave online survey using a sample from a local community where there is a salient risk management issue and the three communicative processes can be reasonably observed. Residents within the area to be affected by an environmentally hazardous project will be invited to the online survey via post mail. Respondents will report their communication experiences with, and amount of knowledge and elaboration about a local environmental agency making decisions about the project. They will also rate their level of trust toward the agency in both waves of the survey, allowing measurement of the persistence of trust."

Although in the past decade THz integrated circuits in silicon have improved remarkably in output power and efficiency, their reliance on high-quality-factor resonance makes the current THz sensors narrowband and fails to fully capitalize on the available broad spectrum for wide-range gas sensing and high-precision radar ranging. To break such a limit, this project investigates a new technique based on electronic THz frequency comb. Through parallel signal processing on the integrated circuit chip, gas sensor and imaging radar using the proposed technique will achieve significantly better spectral coverage and energy efficiency. This research effort will also be integrated with the principal investigator's educational career goal of promoting highly-interdisciplinary studies through the creation of new courses and engaging underrepresented and K-12 students through MIT's outreach programs.<br/><br/>The objective of this proposal is to leverage the integration capability of the silicon semiconductor fabrication process and use THz frequency comb technique to distribute the signal-sensing load to an array of narrowband, precisely-controlled THz circuit units. It maintains high energy efficiency while covering a wide bandwidth in a scalable fashion. Sensors based on two types of THz frequency comb will be investigated under this program. First, a rotational-mode molecular sensor will be demonstrated using an evenly distributed frequency comb. The frequency comb will seamlessly cover more than 100 GHz of bandwidth and increase the spectral scanning speed of chip-scale THz spectrometer by a factor of 200. Through an on-chip frequency calibration technique, the spectrometer will scan the frequency spectrum with one-part-per-billion level frequency precision. Second, an imaging radar will be demonstrated using a non-uniform comb and compressive sensing. By quantizing the target distance with a set of nonlinearly distributed wavelengths and by using an error-correction algorithm, the radar can operate with low signal-to-noise ratio and low power consumption. The THz comb radar will also be integrated with a low-cost sensor array in a quasi-optical configuration, so that real-time 3D imaging with electronic scanning and fine resolution can be realized. Through these comprehensive studies, the program will establish the advantages of parallelism in chip-scale wide-band signal sensing and processing."

It will add to the longest-running data set on how selection in plants changes in response to changes in annual snowpack and pollinator availability, and to model for the first time how adaptation to these conditions allows populations to recover. It will determine how selective pressures change in response to water availability, how genetic variation in leaf and flower traits interact with climate change to affect birth and death rates, and how changes in pollination patterns and rates interact with the physical environment to influence evolutionary change. Responses of population size to climate change will be projected over the next century and provide a case study of how other species might respond.

The relationship between selection of functional vegetative traits and water availability will be determined with two approaches: observational data on selection over two decades and a new experimental manipulation of snowmelt date and summer precipitation. The project will examine the dependence of evolutionary and demographic responses on genetic variance in traits, as measured from a full-sib breeding design. The extent of adaptive phenotypic plasticity in response to annual snowmelt date will also be incorporated into projections of population size.

Exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere and the storage of CO2 in the ocean is an important control on atmospheric concentrations. During recent ice ages, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were naturally 30% lower than pre industrial levels.  Extensive evidence indicates this reduction was caused by greater storage of CO2 in the ocean. Today, wind-driven air-sea exchange in the Southern Ocean is one of the primary mechanisms for CO2 exchange between these two reservoirs.  During the last glacial interval, reduced exchange in the Southern Ocean driven by changes in ocean circulation and the resulting changes in ocean chemistry is believed to have played an important role in sequestering more CO2 in the ocean; however, there is ongoing debate about the specific state of glacial oceanic and atmospheric circulation in the Southern Ocean. Current studies are hampered by a lack of suitable sediment cores from key locations; existing cores are concentrated in the South Atlantic and Southwestern Pacific. There are clearly changes in the chemistry and circulation of water masses between these two regions, but there is little information available from the critical region of the Southern Indian Ocean where much of the CO2 exchange occurs today. The few cores from this area that do exist have been exhausted over the past 30 years of research. In this study, researchers will collect cores on a cruise to Southeast Indian Ocean waters and conduct the initial shore-based stratigraphic and environmental analyses. Collaborations with Australian scientists will be an integral part of this work and these cores will be an important resource for scientists around the world. The project supports the training of both a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher.<br/><br/>The circulation and ventilation of water masses at intermediate depths (~500-1400 m) in the Southern Indian Ocean are central to atmosphere-ocean CO2 partitioning. During glaciations changes in both thermohaline circulation and wind-driven Southern Ocean ventilation are believed to have played an important role in sequestering atmospheric CO2. A detailed understanding of the interaction between the physical mechanisms of thermohaline overturning circulation and wind-driven ventilation requires precise definition of changes in water mass boundaries and properties across the deglaciation. The use of vertical and horizontal transects of sediment core material has been fundamental in identifying past variations in the structure of the ocean. Published transects of paleo-proxies in the glacial South Atlantic differ substantially from the Southwest Pacific, leading to the idea that processes in the Southeast Indian Ocean had a significant influence on glacial CO2 exchange. Consequently, this work will constrain surface frontal locations that shift in response to changes in atmospheric circulation, as well as deep water mass boundaries and properties that vary with ocean circulation patterns. The cruise objective is to obtain 30-50 cores to create depth and latitudinal transects underlying both subantarctic and subtropical waters in the Southeast Indian Ocean from a region west and south of Australia. The scientific objective is to determine the temporal evolution of the horizontal and vertical distribution of proxies (e.g.13C, 18O, Nd isotopes) that will reconstruct the water source and ventilation history of this critical region of the Southern Ocean.  The scientific outcomes will be to produce: 1) the first depth transect of water mass proxies in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean over the last glacial cycle, and 2) a latitudinal transect of surface and deep water properties."

Because iron is an essential trace element for biological systems and exists at very, very low concentrations in the open ocean, siderophores perform a critical role in capturing iron for cellular function. It is known that marine bacteria can produce two different types of siderophores that either tightly bind iron or only weakly do so, with different ecological consequences. This researcher will leverage an exceptional career on metal-organism interactions to examine the unsolved question of exactly what environmental and biochemical conditions (for example the availability of iron) control bacterial production of various siderophores. Results will generate significant new understanding of a critical chemical oceanographic process, and cap this researcher's groundbreaking discoveries that have built to this project. Funding for this research will also support the advancement of women in science by both providing the highest quality training of a female scientist and providing the opportunity for her to host an oceanography booth at the Princeton Plasma Physics Lab's ""Young Women in Science"" conference.<br/><br/>This study will use Vibrio harveyi as a model organism to investigate a variety of questions surrounding the marine bacterial production of weak and strong siderophores. To start, the investigation will look into how siderophore production is controlled by varying iron availability and quorum sensing (i.e. a coordinated response correlated to population density and/or certain signaling molecules).  This also includes in-depth investigation of the impact of life phase and biochemical changes with growth as they relate to coordinated use of weak and strong siderophores. Using established protocols for genetic manipulation of V. harveyi, the researcher plans to discover how varying combinations of weak and strong siderophores maximize the uptake of iron. The broader biogeochemical implications of this study to the field of chemical oceanography, with regard to the microbial use of, and cellular responses to, many essential micronutrients in the ocean would be to significantly influence understanding of elemental distributions beyond the specific study of iron and siderophore cycling in the ocean."

Exchange of CO2 with the atmosphere and the storage of CO2 in the ocean is an important control on atmospheric concentrations. During recent ice ages, atmospheric CO2 concentrations were naturally 30% lower than pre industrial levels.  Extensive evidence indicates this reduction was caused by greater storage of CO2 in the ocean. Today, wind-driven air-sea exchange in the Southern Ocean is one of the primary mechanisms for CO2 exchange between these two reservoirs.  During the last glacial interval, reduced exchange in the Southern Ocean driven by changes in ocean circulation and the resulting changes in ocean chemistry is believed to have played an important role in sequestering more CO2 in the ocean; however, there is ongoing debate about the specific state of glacial oceanic and atmospheric circulation in the Southern Ocean. Current studies are hampered by a lack of suitable sediment cores from key locations; existing cores are concentrated in the South Atlantic and Southwestern Pacific. There are clearly changes in the chemistry and circulation of water masses between these two regions, but there is little information available from the critical region of the Southern Indian Ocean where much of the CO2 exchange occurs today. The few cores from this area that do exist have been exhausted over the past 30 years of research. In this study, researchers will collect cores on a cruise to Southeast Indian Ocean waters and conduct the initial shore-based stratigraphic and environmental analyses. Collaborations with Australian scientists will be an integral part of this work and these cores will be an important resource for scientists around the world. The project supports the training of both a graduate student and a postdoctoral researcher.<br/><br/>The circulation and ventilation of water masses at intermediate depths (~500-1400 m) in the Southern Indian Ocean are central to atmosphere-ocean CO2 partitioning. During glaciations changes in both thermohaline circulation and wind-driven Southern Ocean ventilation are believed to have played an important role in sequestering atmospheric CO2. A detailed understanding of the interaction between the physical mechanisms of thermohaline overturning circulation and wind-driven ventilation requires precise definition of changes in water mass boundaries and properties across the deglaciation. The use of vertical and horizontal transects of sediment core material has been fundamental in identifying past variations in the structure of the ocean. Published transects of paleo-proxies in the glacial South Atlantic differ substantially from the Southwest Pacific, leading to the idea that processes in the Southeast Indian Ocean had a significant influence on glacial CO2 exchange. Consequently, this work will constrain surface frontal locations that shift in response to changes in atmospheric circulation, as well as deep water mass boundaries and properties that vary with ocean circulation patterns. The cruise objective is to obtain 30-50 cores to create depth and latitudinal transects underlying both subantarctic and subtropical waters in the Southeast Indian Ocean from a region west and south of Australia. The scientific objective is to determine the temporal evolution of the horizontal and vertical distribution of proxies (e.g.13C, 18O, Nd isotopes) that will reconstruct the water source and ventilation history of this critical region of the Southern Ocean.  The scientific outcomes will be to produce: 1) the first depth transect of water mass proxies in the Indian Ocean sector of the Southern Ocean over the last glacial cycle, and 2) a latitudinal transect of surface and deep water properties."

However, the necessary and continuous scaling of GPUsin terms of performance and energy efficiency will not be an easy task.Prior works have shown that two biggest impediments towards this scaling are thelimited memory bandwidth and the excessive data movement across different levelsof the memory hierarchy. In order to alleviate these two issues, die-stacking technologyis gaining momentum in the realm of high-performance energy-efficient GPU computing.This technology not only enables very high memory bandwidth for better performancebut also provides support for processing-near-memory (PNM) to reduce data movement,access latencies, and energy consumption. Although these technologies seem promising,the architectural support and execution models for PNM-based GPUs and theirimplications on the entire system design have largely been unexplored. This project takes a fresh look at the design and execution model of a PNM-enabled GPU, which consists of multiple memory stacks and each memory stack incorporatesa 3D-stacked logic layer that can consist of multiple PNM GPU cores and other uncorecomponents. Considering that GPUs are becoming an inevitable part of every computingsystem ranging from warehouse-scale computers to wearable devices, the insights resulting from this research can have a long-term positive impact on the GPU-basedcomputing. The findings of this research will be incorporated to existing and new undergraduate and graduate courses, which will directly help in educating and training students, including women and students from diverse backgrounds and minority groups.<br/><br/>First, a detailed design space exploration will be performed, whichwill involve the study of the impact and interactions of different design choicesrelated to PNM cores (e.g., register file, SIMD width, pipeline components,warp occupancy), uncore components at the logic layer (e.g., caches) and stackedmemory (e.g., number of stacked memories). Second, acomputation distribution framework (CDF) will be developed that will answer: a) when is itpreferable to map computations to PNM cores, b) which PNM coresand computations they should be?, and c) how can we effectively take advantage of both PNM and regular GPU cores? The CDF will leverage different static andruntime strategies to address many of such similar questions to push theenvelopes of energy efficiency and performance even further. The proposed research components will be evaluated via a wide-range of GPGPU applications. If successful, the findings of this research would better equip PNM-enabledGPUs to effectively alleviate the two major bottlenecks: memory bandwidth andenergy."

The challenge of translating ideas from one context to another is at the heart of any development intervention. Understanding how knowledge moves between different cultural contexts and levels of governance, and how it is mobilized to influence particular choices and outcomes, is crucial to devising and implementing effective solutions to socio-environmental problems.  Researchers are becoming increasingly aware that knowledge, decision-making, and action are influenced by relations beyond just those between individual human actors. Meteorological events, environmental characteristics, technologies and infrastructures, graphic representations, and other factors also affect  how knowledge is shared, interpreted, and applied. This complicated nexus of relationships, which acts  at multiple and interacting scales from local and regional to national  and international, makes it  difficult to predict  the effects of particular interventions, a challenging problem for both policy makers  and for local people who are trying to cope with a changing world. The research funded by this award will investigate whether general predictive principles can be discerned by looking more closely at the interaction of these factors and scales in the context of a specific environmental adaptation project.  <br/><br/>The research will be conducted by University of Georgia doctoral student, Jacob Weger, under the supervision of Dr. J. Peter Brosius. Weger will focus data collection on areas included in the Mekong Delta Plan, a Dutch-Vietnamese initiative outlining a 100-year plan for sustainable development. Few regions of the world are as threatened by climate change as the Mekong Delta where rising sea levels already are transforming the area into a predominantly brackish environment. Looking at how a comprehensive plan actually works in this challenging environment provides a unique research opportunity. Weger will conduct ethnographic research at sites spanning multiple levels of governance: the Netherlands, Vietnam, and a coastal province of the Mekong Delta. He will collect data using a suite of methods: in-depth interviews, document analysis, participant observation of meetings, workshops, and farming practices, and social network analysis. These data will be used to construct generalized models of the networks linking levels of governance, as well as those that influence farmer decisions.The goal is to understand how knowledge moves and is interpreted across these levels as it influences local decision-making.  Findings from this research will contribute to understanding how knowledge networks, translation politics, and other material conditions and constraints shape response to development interventions. Results will be shared with participants at all levels, including local communities, so that they, too, may contribute effectively to development planning and policy."

In the low-power embedded systems used by these applications, energy efficiency is the primary factor that determines critical system characteristics such as size, weight, cost, reliability, and lifetime. Existing power management techniques for these systems trade off performance to reduce power. However, given the stringent power and energy constraints of emerging and existing low-power systems, solutions that sacrifice performance to reduce power may be unacceptable. Thus, this research focuses on novel opportunities to reduce power without reducing performance, thereby providing free power and energy savings for emerging low-power systems, and in turn, reducing their size, weight, and cost, and increasing their reliability and lifetime. This research also provides a non-intrusive way to significantly improve the energy efficiency of existing systems without sacrificing any performance or re-designing system hardware or software. Considering the sheer number of low-power processors being produced, their importance for future technologies, and the stringent power and energy constraints of these systems, saving power in such systems can have a significant impact. In addition to the technological impacts of this research, the project will contribute several other benefits, including new project-based research opportunities for undergraduate students and students from underrepresented groups, community outreach to K-12 students and other members of the university and community at large through public project showcases, and global outreach in the form of an educational initiative in Kenya on improving best practices in farming with IoT technology. Data characterizing the impacts of project activities on student learning outcomes will be used to improve the integration of research and educational activities at the PI?s institution.<br/><br/>The research contributions of this project stem from the development of novel techniques for hardware-software co-analysis that can identify the maximal set of hardware resources that an application can use in a processor, irrespective of application inputs. The results of such co-analysis can be used to eliminate any power expended by resources that an application can never use. This novel co-analysis approach can be leveraged to enable a suite of automated application-specific power management techniques, including application-specific timing analysis, which identifies the longest paths that an application can exercise in a processor and determines an application-specific lower-than-nominal minimum operating voltage that is guaranteed to be safe for the application; application-specific power domain formation and power gating, which can provide opportunities to power gate larger areas of logic for longer periods of time than state-of-the-art power gating techniques; application-specific peak power and energy management, which guarantees application-specific bounds on a design?s peak power and energy requirements and enables application-specific sizing for energy storage and harvesting components; and application-specific thermal management, which can identify and avoid hotspots, prevent thermal emergencies, and perform temperature-aware scheduling for a given application."

Estimates suggest that the mixing in these boundary layers is comparable to, or exceeds, the mixing in the interior of the ocean basins. Recent work argues that such diapycnal mixing sustains upwelling along sloped topography that is a pervasive characteristic of the large-scale ocean overturning circulation with important implication for the ventilation rate of the abyssal ocean. In this work, PI proposes to examine the dynamics and impacts of these deep-ocean strati&#64257;ed, turbulent boundary layers above sloping bathymetry by conducting high-resolution, three-dimensional numerical simulations in the context of high-resolution field observations. It aims to improve physical understanding of a key process with large-scale impacts and thereby improve our interpretation of limited observations and approaches to parameterizing these boundary layers. The effort will enhance and extend international collaborations between the PI and two groups with which he has worked in the past. It will allow the PI to work first hand with uniquely appropriate data sets for the study while furthering ongoing modeling collaborations. Findings will be broadly disseminated through presentation at scientific conferences and through publications in the peer reviewed literature. Flow visualizations with corresponding narratives will also be developed and disseminated as outreach. These will be available on YouTube and via blogs focusing on fluid dynamics but specializing in scientific communication and outreach.<br/><br/>The scientific objective of the project is to better understand the dynamics of these boundary layers and how they interact with and influence the comparatively quiescent interior basin. PI and his collaborators also seek to understand how to best interpret moored temperature measurements given practical sampling limitations and in light of recent challenges to the use of Thorpe scale estimates of turbulence intensity for these flows in particular. Preliminary results compare remarkably well with observations, suggesting that the essential dynamics are being captured with quantitative accuracy and that a synthesis of focused simulation and re-analysis of field observations will lead to a more complete picture of the underlying dynamics than either approach alone. The observations to be simulated include three sites in close proximity in the Northeast Atlantic with subcritical, critical, and supercritical topographic slopes and with estimates of near-bottom dissipation rates that vary systematically with slope by two orders of magnitude. The proposed research will add to our understanding of tidally-driven boundary layers and how they interact with, and influence, the comparatively quiescent interior basin. The proposed work will also provide insight and guidance for the interpretation of field measurements obtained from one-dimensional moorings or vertical profiles. In particular, the consequences and implications of assuming that Thorpe scales are closely related to Ozmidov scales in these boundary layers and that horizontal advection of non-locally produced turbulence can be neglected in interpreting the observations will be addressed. This insight can form the basis for improved parameterizations of these processes in larger-scale models."

Regular monitoring increases access to preventative treatment, but is often cost prohibitive or infeasible given high demands placed on health care providers. Yet, it is critical for individuals with Bipolar Disorder (BPD), a chronic psychiatric illness characterized by mood transitions between healthy and pathological states. Transitions into pathological states are associated with profound disruptions in personal, social, vocational functioning, and emotion regulation. This Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) project investigates new approaches in speech-based mood monitoring by taking advantage of the link between speech, emotion, and mood. The approach includes processing data with short-term variation (speech), estimating mid-term variation (emotion), and then using patterns in emotion to recognize long-term variation (mood). The educational outreach includes a design challenge, created with Iridescent, a science education nonprofit, that teaches emotion recognition to underserved children and their parents in informal learning settings. <br/><br/>The research investigates methods to model naturalistic, longitudinal speech data and associate emotion patterns with mood, addressing current challenges in speech emotion recognition and assistive technology that include: generalizability, robustness, and performance.  The approaches generalize to conditions whose symptoms include atypical emotion, such as post-traumatic stress disorder, anxiety, depression, and stress. The research forwards emotion as an intermediate step to simplify the mapping between speech and mood; emotion dysregulation is a common BPD symptom. Emotion is quantified over time in terms of valence and activation to improve generalizability.  Nuisance modulations are controlled to improve robustness.  Together, they result in a set of low-dimensional secondary features whose variations are due to emotion.  These secondary features are segmented to create a coarser temporal description of emotion.  This provides a means to map between speech (a quickly varying signal) and user state (a slowly varying signal), advancing the state-of-the-art.  The results provide quantitative insight into the relationship between emotion variation and user state variation, providing new directions and links between the fields of emotion recognition and assistive technology.  The focus on modeling emotional data using time series techniques results in breakthroughs in the design of emotion recognition and assistive technology algorithms."

Preliminary data indicate an active subsurface biosphere in samples of the lower oceanic crust collected from Atlantis Bank in the SW Indian Ocean as deep as 790 m below the seafloor. Even if life exists in only a fraction of the habitable volume where temperatures permit and fluid flow can deliver carbon and energy sources, an active lower oceanic crust biosphere would have implications for deep carbon budgets and yield insights into microbiota that may have existed on early Earth. This is all of great interest to other research disciplines, educators, and students alike. A K-12 education program will capitalize on groundwork laid by outreach collaborator, A. Martinez, a 7th grade teacher in Eagle Pass, TX, who sailed as outreach expert on Drilling Expedition 360. Martinez works at a Title 1 school with ~98% Hispanic and ~2% Native American students and a high number of English Language Learners and migrants. Annual school visits occur during which the project investigators present hands on-activities introducing students to microbiology, and talks on marine microbiology, the project, and how to pursue science related careers. In addition, monthly Skype meetings with students and PIs update them on project progress. Students travel to the University of Texas Marine Science Institute annually, where they get a campus tour and a 3-hour cruise on the R/V Katy, during which they learn about and help with different oceanographic sampling approaches. The project partially supports two graduate students, a Woods Hole undergraduate summer student, the participation of multiple Texas A+M undergraduate students, and 3 principal investigators at two institutions, including one early career researcher who has not previously received NSF support of his own. <br/><br/>Given the dearth of knowledge of the lower oceanic crust, this project is poised to transform our understanding of life in this vast environment. The project assesses metabolic functions within all three domains of life in this crustal biosphere, with a focus on nutrient cycling and evaluation of connections to other deep marine microbial habitats. The lower ocean crust represents a potentially vast biosphere whose microbial constituents and the biogeochemical cycles they mediate are likely linked to deep ocean processes through faulting and subsurface fluid flow. Atlantis Bank represents a tectonic window that exposes lower oceanic crust directly at the seafloor. This enables seafloor drilling and research on an environment that can transform our understanding of connections between the deep subseafloor biosphere and the rest of the ocean. Preliminary analysis of recovered rocks from Expedition 360 suggests the interaction of seawater with the lower oceanic crust creates varied geochemical conditions capable of supporting diverse microbial life by providing nutrients and chemical energy.  This project is the first interdisciplinary investigation of the microbiology of all 3 domains of life in basement samples that combines diversity and ""meta-omics"" analyses, analysis of nutrient addition experiments, high-throughput culturing and physiological analyses of isolates, including evaluation of their ability to utilize specific carbon sources, Raman spectroscopy, and lipid biomarker analyses. Comparative genomics are used to compare genes and pathways relevant to carbon cycling in these samples to data from published studies of other deep-sea environments. The collected samples present a rare and time-sensitive opportunity to gain detailed insights into microbial life, available carbon and energy sources for this life, and of dispersal of microbiota and connections in biogeochemical processes between the lower oceanic crust and the overlying aphotic water column."

How do speakers choose which form to use? In spoken languages, this choice is largely determined by grammatical and information structural factors such as the previous grammatical role of the entity and whether the entity is the topic under discussion. This dissertation research asks whether pronoun usage in sign languages follows grammatical or gestural rules. American Sign Language (ASL) pronouns, which are points, are thought to get their meaning from ad hoc associations between entities and the space the signer points to. A point towards a space associated with a man named Henry is equivalent to the pronoun 'he' in English. By contrast, a pointing sign towards a space where no entity has been previously associated is predicted to be meaningless. This view suggests that ASL pronouns are primarily spatial associations between entities and signing space, which are not necessarily chosen based on principles of grammar or information structure. Two experiments test whether ASL pronominal forms follow the grammatical patterns of spoken languages. The experiments investigate how ASL signers refer to entities in contexts that vary in spatial associations and the number of possible entities being talked about. <br/><br/>This research will inform our understanding of whether choice of referring expressions is guided by universal or language specific principles. This knowledge can directly contribute to improving education of deaf children who on average have much lower literacy skills than hearing children. By developing a model for how ASL creates referential links between sentences, the project will provide the means to help signing children to understand the parallel processes in English text."

The research also fosters international scientific cooperation.<br/><br/>Eilat Maoz, under the supervision of Dr. Stephan Palmi of the University of Chicago, will explore what global, national, and local forces influence observable patterns in police reform. Police designs are informed by police knowledge, expertise, and practice, and increasingly these designs are shared internationally. The researcher proposes to document their implementation, and examine how they are engaged within the communities that they are implemented. The research will take place through ethnographic fieldwork in the Jamaican Constabulary Force (JCF). The JCF was established when Jamaica was Britain's most thriving sugar colony, as a highly militarized colonial police force. Today, excessive violence and rampant corruption, still endemic in the JCF, are seen as a colonial inheritance that can be superseded through systematic reform. Paradoxically, however, the reform process launched in 2008 deepens and extends foreign involvement within the Force, and is primarily designed to address global security agendas crafted abroad. A parallel dynamic of continuity and change characterizes Jamaica's socioeconomic configurations. While the socially stratified structure of Jamaican society was molded by its colonial history, the local meanings of difference are continuously refigured by global migrations and transnational cultural currents. This research seeks to understand the interaction between these two processes as they conjoin in the realm of police reform. In the first phase of this ethnographic study, Investigators will study how reform plans are crafted, disseminated, and implemented by the Force. This phase will include observing the operations of three branches of the JCF, participation in police training courses, and documentation of attempts to improve the relationship between the police and local communities. Observations within the force will be complemented by in-depth interviews with local and foreign security experts, to further understand the context, content, and specific goals of the reform as it is currently crafted. In the second phase, investigators will collaborate with two Jamaican NGOs that seek to address social violence and criminality in novel ways, bringing together public and private stakeholders, and extending the links between communities in Jamaica and abroad. Data collected will be used to highlight emerging trends in policing, which bring together public and private, local and global, actors and forces. Finally, data will be used to theorize the changing relationship between the police and the state, developing new ways to understand policing."

For smartphones, user satisfaction determines the success or failure for a particular platform. The top ranked factor of user satisfaction is performance, which can be experienced by users through computation performance and battery performance. Therefore, smartphone designs must achieve balance between performance, temperature and energy management in a coordinated manner to maximize user satisfaction. Performance as measured by mobile application execution time has long been assumed to be a deterministic quantity. In reality, execution times vary substantially, depending on the characteristics of data inputs and the varying states of the system. Furthermore, the device surface temperature is a unique constraint for handheld devices. It is tightly coupled with the location of the major heat-generating source within a smartphone. Thus, a smartphone's energy efficiency is intricately related to both performance quality and skin temperature management, making optimization for system energy efficiency a complex task for battery-powered platforms. With the prevalence of portable electronics, the research outcome has a profound impact on the advancement of the relevant research domains and on society.The research agenda is complemented by an education agenda focusing on the design of handheld platforms, such as smartphones and other high-performance wearable electronics. The educational agenda includes (1) new graduate and undergraduate curricula that incorporates processor and handheld temperature and energy management techniques, (2) enhancing computer architecture and mobile computing courses through lab activities on the proposed skin temperature management for mobile devices, (3) mentoring undergraduate and graduate students in research, and (4) attracting and retaining underrepresented groups of students in STEM fields.<br/><br/>This research tackles the problem of performance, temperature and energy efficiency co-optimization from the vantage point of managing the hardware resources. It builds on the PI?s prior work in system and hardware architecture by proposing an optimizing user satisfaction (OPUS) framework for holistic management and coordination of performance quality, skin temperature, and energy efficiency for handhelds. Through accurate execution time models, OPUS dynamically adjusts the mobile platforms to meet the different quality of service goals. The research investigates the dynamic voltage-frequency scaling and temperature-aware computation acceleration algorithms, as well as emerging dynamic cooling mechanisms, suitable for handheld platforms. Optimizing for performance, energy efficiency, or temperature is not new, but optimizing devices in the context of smartphone user satisfaction gives rise to a set of opportunities that are non-existent in conventional computing platforms. The findings can serve as foundations for future user satisfaction optimization research for handheld platforms."

Neighborhoods that are plagued by such excessive violence endure negative effects on social and economic development. Though there are several approaches to addressing gun violence, one successful public health approach to reducing violence focuses on violence interruption, a neighborhood-level model whereby trained intervention workers identify potential violent events and provide immediate alternatives to disrupt violent incidents in their communities. This project investigates the potential of a mobile phone application to help intervention workers predict and interrupt violence during crimes and violent incidents. Violence interruption workers also provide long-term outreach in an attempt to permanently change violent behavior, including providing access to resources such as mental health services, social services, educational opportunities, and work training. This award will also support the design and development of a mobile application that uses predictive analytic techniques to provide violence interruption workers with the most effective intervention strategies based on data from over a decade of prior interventions. <br/><br/>Working with a leading violence interruption organization, this project examines how a mobile application can improve violence interruption outcomes by providing recommendations for the most effective strategies for resolving violent conflicts. The PI and her students will evaluate the mobile application in a 3-month deployment in Chicago during the summer, typically the most violent period of the year. In addition to supporting the reduction of violence, results from this project will lead to a deeper understanding of how to design technology to scale effective violence interruption techniques informed by public health principles. Furthermore, using computational analysis techniques to provide the most effective interruption techniques to violence interruption workers will not only advance our knowledge of the role of technology in violence interruption, but also extend prior literature pertaining to the social and behavioral impact of technology use in crime prevention and violence for those most affected by violent crime. This work will support improvements in the science of broadening participation, in that the focus will be on residents in low income, high crime neighborhoods and local, nonprofit organizations attempting to reduce and mitigate violence in their communities."

Performance of these data-centric applications depends critically on efficient access and processing of data. These applications tend to be highly data-parallel and deal with large amounts. Recent studies show that by the year 2020, data production from individuals and corporations is expected to grow to 73.5 zetabytes, a 4.4 increase from the year 2015. In addition, they tend to expend disproportionately large fraction of time and energy in moving data from storage to compute units, and in instruction processing, when compared to the actual computation. This research seeks to design specialized data-centric computing systems that dramatically reduce these overheads. <br/> <br/>In a general-purpose computing system, the majority of the aggregate die area (over 90%) is devoted for storing and retrieving information at several levels in the memory hierarchy: on-chip caches, main memory (DRAM), and non-volatile memory (NVM). The central vision of this research is to create in-situ compute memories, which re-purpose the elements used in these storage structures and transform them into active computational units. In contrast to prior processing in memory approaches, which augment logic outside the memory arrays, the underpinning principle behind in-situ compute memories is to enable computation in-place within each memory array, without transferring the data in or out of it. Such a transformation could unlock massive data-parallel compute capabilities (up to 100), and reduce energy spent in data movement through various levels of memory hierarchy (up to 20), thereby directly address the needs of data-centric applications. This work develops in-situ compute memory technology, adapts the system software stack and re-designs data-centric applications to take advantage of those memories."

After decades of careful chemical characterization of a series of organic molecules that change color with changing pH, called pH indicator dyes, this accuracy is possible for full strength seawater.  In dynamic coastal systems where riverine freshwater and seawater meet, large variations in the physical chemistry and pH have made extremely accurate measurements of pH difficult and not routinely available. The researcher on this project, having pioneered the development of oceanic pH indicator dyes, would extend their chemical characterization over the much broader range of conditions (e.g. temperature, salinity) required to measure pH in coastal mixed systems. Results from this research would allow oceanographers to quantify variability in carbon chemistry at the interface between rivers and seawater with accuracy not currently possible, relieving pH measurement constraints and allowing greatly increased confidence in evaluating seawater CO2 dynamics in coastal systems. This project will involve graduate and undergraduate students in field studies, giving them hands-on experience in oceanographic research, with results from this research used by a University of South Florida minority student in a dissertation. The PI also plans to continue his history of mentoring summer interns from Eckerd College and local high schools.<br/><br/>Current characterizations for purified sulfonephthalein indicator dyes are highly specific to measure pH values in 'full strength' open ocean seawater.  They are not currently adequate for making extremely accurate pH measurements in systems with salinities lower than 20. This creates uncertainties in all of the CO2 system variables (dissolved inorganic carbon, total alkalinity, CO2 fugacity, etc.) that are connected to pH in equilibrium calculations, thus hampering the ability of oceanographers to quantify estuarine CO2 dynamics with the high degree of confidence required to examine changing coastal carbon cycles. Meticulous characterization of the sulfonephthalein indicator dye series across estuarine conditions, combined with previous open ocean work, will allow for researchers to extend highly precise and accurate pH measurements over salinities from 0 to 40. The calibrations will be performed using procedures to characterize the hydrogen ion exchange parameters and the spectral absorbance behavior of sulfonephthaleins, as well as the chromatographic procedures to obtain purified indicators. The new analytical capability for pH measurements generated by this project will enable researchers and coastal management professionals to generate trusted pH measurements in lakes, rivers, and mixed salinity systems, a major advance in the accurate physical chemical characterization of natural waters."

Climate change and other detrimental environment factors are likely to blame. Unhealthy coral reefs cannot support the fish and other life that make the reef a vibrant and diverse ecosystem.  Corals reefs in the Caribbean Sea are disease hotspots and many reefs have experienced population collapses due to outbreaks of disease. Importantly, coral species vary in their susceptible to disease, but the reasons behind this variation are unknown. This project will quantify coral susceptibility to disease by examining coral immunity using several novel approaches and experiments. Seven species of coral that differ in disease susceptibility, growth rates, growth form and reproductive strategies will be used. Immune responses of each species of coral will be measured by exposing the corals to bacterial immune stimulators. Susceptibility to white plague disease, a prevalent disease affecting many species of corals, will also be measured by exposing the corals to active white plague disease and calculating disease transmission rates. The immune response and disease transmission data for each coral species will be used to develop a predictive model to determine how different coral communities will respond to disease threats under climate change scenarios. This project will support graduate students at University of Texas, Arlington (Hispanic-serving Institution) and University of Virgin Islands (Historically Black University) and many undergraduate students at all three institutions (Mote Marine Laboratory). This research will be highlighted at outreach events at all three institutions which take place regularly and include Earth Day Texas in Dallas, TX, Mote's Living Reef Exhibit and Aquarium in Sarasota, FL and ""Reef Fest"" and Agricultural fairs in the U.S. Virgin Islands.<br/><br/>Environmental changes, such as ocean warming, have led to an increase in the prevalence of coral diseases, causing region-wide population collapses in some locations. However, not all coral species, or even populations within species, are affected by disease equally. Some species are host to many different types of diseases, but have limited mortality. Other species suffer significant disease-related mortality. How and why disease susceptibility differs among species and the effects of this differential susceptibility on reef community structure and composition are currently unknown. This project will use immune-challenge experiments that will quantify novel components of the innate immune system of corals, coupled with the application of a trait-based model, to fulfill three goals: 1) Determine variability of coral immune traits in seven common coral species found on Caribbean reefs, 2) Determine the variability in resistance to white plague disease transmission in the same coral species 3) Develop a predictive model of coral community assemblage that incorporates immune traits. Quantification of coral immunity will also incorporate unique approaches, such as combining full transcriptome sequencing with protein activity assays for a gene-to-phenotype analysis. Data will be mapped onto immune pathways for comprehensive pathway evaluation between coral species and these will serve as trait inputs into a ""traitspace"" model. These traits will provide continuous data within the model, which will create a probability density function (PDF) for the trait distributions of each species. These PDFs will then be used to determine the probability of species under different disease exposure scenarios. Model analyses will determine which traits influence community structure and characterize how disease exposure and the immune response will predict community assemblages through space and time.

Nonlinear waves are ubiquitous in nature. Examples include water waves, acoustics, the solar wind, vibrational waves in materials and laser beams, and propagation of nerve impulses, among many others. These disparate types of phenomena can be described by mathematical models that are based on hyperbolic, elliptic and dispersive partial differential equations and that are surprisingly similar to each other. However, the mathematical equations are extremely difficult to solve; in fact the nonlinear waves are considered as one of the most important problems in the analysis of partial differential equations. Although considerable progress has been made in the field over the past few decades, new important and challenging problems have been emerging in physics, engineering, industry, material sciences, biology, and other fields. The goal of the conference is to bring together leading experts in various theoretical and applied aspects of nonlinear waves to promote and enhance unifying techniques, to establish new connections, and to foster cross-fertilization among different fields of application. Relevant world-class experts and specialists will give research talks at the conference. The conference will provide an opportunity for students and junior researchers, including those from underrepresented groups in mathematics groups to get abreast with the latest achievements in the field and present their recent research results. The conference will disseminate research results and promote the research area through talks, webpage, flyers, and posters. The conference web site is www.math.pitt.edu/~dwang/pde2017.html<br/><br/>The conference will discuss the recent breakthrough work and substantial progress achieved in the following directions: water waves, kinetic theory, waves in novel media such as topological insulators and metamaterials, waves in nonlinear optics and condensed matter physics, and so on. Many unexpected connections were discovered linking these problems to each other, and/or to problems in other areas of partial differential equations and to emerging applications which previously appeared unrelated or had little impact on one another.

Many important biochemical and biological systems are not amenable to traditional analytical approaches (e.g., magnetic resonance or X-ray crystallography), creating a need for new and complementary methods to better characterize biomolecules and biomolecular complexes. Dr. Fernandez-Lima's mass spectrometry (MS)-based approaches offer significant enhancement of characterization capabilities.  In parallel with these research efforts, he plans a multi-level outreach approach integrating a seminar series, undergraduate and graduate courses, museum open-house events, hands-on MS experiences, summer internships, and development of a virtual MS experiment series. Partnering with local K-12 schools, neighboring community colleges, and student training programs at FIU, this plan aims to enhance learning and exposure to modern MS techniques and to recruit students from underrepresented minorities into science, technology, engineering and mathematics.<br/><br/>By integrating mass spectrometry (MS), trapped ion mobility spectrometry (TIMS), hydrogen/deuterium back-exchange (HDX) and ion spectroscopy techniques, Prof. Fernandez-Lima and his group are studying intrinsically disordered systems, with a focus on DNA-binding proteins and DNA-protein complexes. This new experimental approach has the potential to transform the way we interrogate biological molecules, providing detailed, useful structural information on co-existing states in the conformational ensemble (e.g., equilibrium and kinetic intermediates).  Experiments target new structural information, employing mobility-selected conformation interrogation to enable study of conformational changes from solution to the gas-phase, and providing information on the energy barriers for conformational rearrangement and their time scales. The research outcomes of this project may impact our fundamental understanding of the structural motifs that drive the folding and unfolding of biomolecules and biomolecular complexes. In addition, an outreach educational program ""FIUMASS: MS Experience for All"" has been established at Florida International University to increase the exposure of graduate, undergraduate, and high school minority students to the practical aspects of structural mass spectrometry."

The education program will (1) engage a group of energy practitioners through an advisory group; (2) educate the general public on energy efficiency through an open-access tool; (3) facilitate communication among researchers across related fields through an interdisciplinary workshop; and (4) train future engineers and scientists with an interdisciplinary mindset and effective skills.<br/><br/>Key scientific contributions are anticipated to stem from both a large-scale building energy dataset as well as a new computational energy-efficiency evaluation framework that incorporates knowledge and advances from various disciplines. To construct valid baseline energy use, the framework uses control group, pre-installation period, control of time-variant covariates, flexible fixed effects, and panel regressions. This evaluation framework is timely now that smart meters are becoming the norm. The project uses a comprehensive dataset from Phoenix metropolitan Arizona that includes 15 min-interval customer-level energy demand data from 2013-present for 48,000 residential customers, ensuring statistically robust and representative results. Multi-year appliance saturation surveys on customer-level energy efficiency features, technologies, occupant behaviors, building attributes, and demographics, together with the proposed evaluation framework, should overcome key shortcomings in existing evaluation studies, including inappropriate baseline energy construction, selection bias, and omitted variable bias. This project also should uncover the complex impact heterogeneity of energy efficiency. For evaluation of environmental and economic benefits, intraday data of technology-specific impacts will offer more precise results than previous studies using average daily data.

Wearable construction toolkits such as Lilypad have shown promise in attracting underrepresented groups to STEM, expanding perceptions of computing, and empowering users to create personally meaningful computational designs.  These tools, however, set a high bar to entry, especially for young children, by requiring some programming, an understanding of electronics and circuits, and manual skills like sewing.   This research will investigate new interfaces, techniques, and tools to enable children ages 5-10 to program, build, and use their own interactive wearables.   While the target age range is ambitious, spanning differences in cognitive and motor skills as well as educational experiences, a key focus of the work is to better understand how to increase the approachability of wearable design, even for young children, and to scaffold users into creating increasingly complex designs to match their ability level.  Project outcomes will inform future digital-physical kits for children, advance our understanding of how to engage children in computational thinking and construction, and contribute to the areas of wearable computing and interaction design for children more broadly.  While the immediate target community of this research is young children, the methods will have broader implications for maker tools in general.  Working with his partners, the PI will conduct ""making"" workshops and run case studies which will provide new opportunities for engagement in design and STEM.  These case studies will also allow children to showcase their designs publicly.  The PI will open source his artifacts, create and upload generally accessible videos to YouTube, and maintain a public website describing the work.<br/><br/>This research will explore new tools, techniques, and interfaces for overcoming key challenges that currently limit broader participation in wearable creation, particularly with young children, and evaluate new developmentally-appropriate approaches in a mixture of lab and field studies.  The project will introduce a tiered hybrid tangible-graphical approach to wearable design, wherein children build and program their wearable creations physically by using tangible plug-and-play modules.  For older children (ages 8-10), touchscreen interfaces will allow the creation of increasingly sophisticated designs through visual programming, debugging, and sensor-based programming by demonstration.  This empirical research will advance the growing area of programming approaches and creative design tools for young children, and will provide the first assessments of how young children build wearables, including what they want to build, how they approach the building process, how they use their own designs in their everyday lives, and skill development related to engineering and computational thinking."

As more information sources have come online, thousands of amateur sleuths collaborate on websites to investigate for themselves. Some crowdsourced investigations have yielded remarkable success, helping to catch criminals and locate missing persons. Other well-intentioned efforts have ended in failure or disaster, and digital vigilantism is on the rise. There is an urgent need for research informed by scientific, technical, and social computing perspectives to shape the future of crowdsourced investigations as a force for societal good.  This need can be addressed with expert-led crowdsourcing, a novel approach to investigation that leverages the complementary strengths of experts and crowds to achieve greater results than either could alone. The outreach efforts will bring new tools and techniques to professional and amateur investigators online and in workshops.  The educational activities will train diverse groups of students to leverage cutting-edge investigative technologies and big data to answer pressing societal questions.<br/><br/>This research will transform the science of investigation in multiple domains by synthesizing concepts and techniques from social computing and crowdsourcing that have mostly been overlooked. For each of the three themes, the research will study expert investigators, extend the infrastructure's support for expert-crowd interaction, and evaluate the benefits of the infrastructure on a series of photo investigation tasks.  Rigorous studies of current expert investigations will generate rich findings about current practice and distill design considerations. This research will also introduce the novel approach of expert-led crowdsourcing to overcome the cognitive and resource limits of individual experts and the effectiveness, ethics, and efficiency challenges to crowds. The new platform will make concrete the ideas behind expert-led crowdsourcing and provide a site for evaluation studies that generate foundational knowledge and broader principles of online collaboration and collaborative discovery."

Competition for water continues to grow among agriculture, energy production, domestic and industrial uses, leading to water shortages and tradeoffs that have to be addressed. While water deficits can be partially met through wastewater reuse and desalination plants, these methods and their technologies carry unclear threats to the quality and health of our soils, wherein 30 percent of global freshwater is stored. Integrated resources management is an essential tool for these tightly interconnected, essential resources: their interlinkages (the FEW Nexus) must be defined and quantified to enable a holistic understanding of the tradeoffs resulting from different choices about their management and use. This workshop will improve the level of integration of future research, foster national research teams, and build on the investments made toward the creation of a Food-Energy-Water community of science.  It will bring together leading stakeholders in the FEW resources Nexus with faculty in science, engineering, and policy disciplines to help identify systems-level conflicts among alternative uses and provide input on the research agenda of the FEW Nexus community. This will help foster new cooperation among science and engineering disciplines for more sustainable management of FEW resources at local, national and international levels to address societal challenges.<br/><br/>Part 2: Technical Description.<br/>The overall workshop goal is the consolidation of a FEW Nexus Community of Science and creation of a national platform for FEW nexus biophysical, social and policy research to address key challenges in the context of the FEW Nexus. Among the primary workshop outcomes will be the identification of new research and data collection approaches to enhance longitudinal research to model and monitor the processes associated with resilience, vulnerability, and risk reduction. Working groups in the nexus dimensions will establish synergistic research teams to develop joint FEW research proposals for submission to national and international funding agencies. These groups will develop a common Nexus roadmap of science, policy, technology, and education issues critical to the sustainable management of FEW resources. Such a road map is essential for the proper planning and understanding of the tradeoffs among FEW resources. This road map will be developed through an accessible e-portal that is designed to facilitate future engagement with stakeholders and translate knowledge into action. It will also become the foundation of further investigations by providing insight toward new knowledge generated as a result of its implementation. The FEW Nexus community of science will provide a platform from which the Nexus community will share and exchange ideas, draw on international, national, and local FEW nexus efforts, and facilitate the exchange of ideas and development of partnerships for sharing data and information. This will lay the foundation for future FEW Nexus research and allow public, private and scientific sector stakeholders to participate in research to inform decision and policy making."

As a subset of laser scanning microscopes (LSMs), TPMs achieve very high spatial resolution by using a focused, high-power laser beam to excite fluorescence via the simultaneous absorption of two low energy infrared photons to stimulate emission in the visible. Because of the increased resolution, and increased penetration of infrared light into tissue compared with other LSM methods, TPMs have become widely accepted for use in the medical industry, specifically for dermatology and neurology. The technology developed for this project will address the $500 million LSM market by delivering a low-cost, electrically tunable optic capable of simultaneously controlling focus and aberrations while operating an order of magnitude faster than competitive technologies. The 3D imaging capabilities enabled by this technology will result in an advancement of microscopy techniques and diagnostic methods, thereby reducing diagnostic time and patient discomfort. Other markets that can easily be addressed by this technology include laser marking and engraving, endoscopes, optical coherence tomography, and machine vision. <br/><br/>The intellectual merit of this project will be the development of high-power capable coatings for micro-electro-mechanical systems (MEMS) based deformable mirrors. Because these mirrors consist of a thin membrane with a reflective surface, standard glass coating processes for solid substrates are incompatible. Instead, the surface material for the mirror must be deposited within one of the many fabrication steps for the DMM. This project will address the unique challenges of developing high-reflectance coatings and incorporate them into the existing DMM fabrication process. The project involves four key objectives: 1) developing gold coated deformable mirrors, 2) developing protected silver coated deformable mirrors, 3) measuring key performance parameters, and 4) measuring and defining the power handling capability and damage thresholds of gold and silver DMMs. The anticipated result will be a fully characterized DMM capable of long operation under the high-power femtosecond laser illumination regime used in two photon microscopes."

This project aims to capitalize on a unique opportunity to bring ECE department heads together with women and underrepresented minority (W-URM) graduate students to help diversify the ECE faculty. The project team, including ECE department heads and the ECE Department Heads Association (ECEDHA) leaders, proposes iREDEFINE, an Annual Workshop focused on increasing the numbers of W-URM holding tenure track faculty or postdoc positions in ECE in the US. iREDEFINE capitalizes on the unique environment provided by the ECEDHA Annual Conference and ECExpo to create a mechanism to motivate and prepare graduate W-URM students for pursuing faculty positions in US universities. The unique opportunity arises due to the high concentration of ECE department chairs attending the event, most of whom are invested in increasing the diversity of their faculty. The two day Workshop will overlap with the ECEDHA Conference. The first day will be devoted to providing a glimpse of the life and career of an ECE faculty, information on different types of schools, tips on how to prepare for a successful academic position interview, information on effective instructional techniques, information on seeking research funding, how to build connections with industry, and how to build confidence and negotiating skills. The second day will coincide with the first day of the ECEDHA conference and all iREDEFINE attendees will have access to all conference sessions. This day will provide an immersive experience on the issues that are on the minds of ECE faculty, such as the latest technology and research trends, the latest teaching innovations, and efforts to find solutions to key problems, such as lack of diversity and shifting enrollment trends. The iREDEFINE attendees will present posters on their work to the ECE department chairs, which will give them the opportunity to closely interact with the very people they will be contacting during their job search and also practice some of the skills that they learned the day before. The poster session will feed into a reception for Workshop attendees, ECE chairs and industry affiliates, which will offer further networking opportunities. In addition to the Workshop, a mentoring program will be established to extend beyond the workshop. The project will be evaluated and fine-tuned after the first offering to maximize its impact.<br/><br/>This effort will have a significant impact on the field of ECE and as a result the future of technology. Diversifying the faculty will help enhance the diversity of the student population in ECE by providing role models, and thus diversify the ECE workforce. As ECE is a major enabler in technological discovery, a more diverse practitioner/educator pool will lead to new perspectives on technological innovation and how that serves society. The proposed project will serve as a potential model for improving diversity in STEM disciplines in general."

The adoptive transfer of large numbers of tumor-infiltrating T cells or genetically engineered T cells with cancer-targeting receptors has shown tremendous promise for eradicating tumors in clinical trials. The existing methods to manufacture large quantities of such human T cells, however, have severe limitations of low efficiency, inconsistency and lack of sufficient quality control. This EAGER proposal aims to develop a novel human T cell biomanufacturing platform for large-scale, robust, and high-quality cellular production. The accomplishment of this study will provide not only the proof-of-concept but also the ready-to-use bioproduction platform for new means of T cell expansion for clinical immune cancer therapy. The novel technology employed in the rational production process engineering will also be able to provide guidelines and apply easily to the manufacturing of other therapeutic cells. Whereas the results and knowledge obtained in this study will be useful for both the biopharmaceutical industry and academic research, all cancer patients may benefit from the products of this research project. <br/><br/>The primary goal of this proposal is to develop an entirely new, metabolic cell process engineering (MCPE)-based, cellular biomanufacturing platform using stirred-tank bioreactor to produce reliable and reproducible large quantities of human T cells for immune cancer therapy, aiming to effectively produce more than 2,000 million T cells with high quality. The traditional T cell biomanufacturing presents several weaknesses: 1) low efficiency of mass transfer that often results in heterologous cellular metabolism, cell viability and product quality; 2) ineffective process parameter control that causes low robustness, reliability and scalability; and 3) lack of critical quality attributes in the early and middle stages of process development, limiting the application of quality by design. This project focuses on developing an innovative stirred-tank-based cellular biomanufacturing platform to produce reliable and reproducible large quantities of human T cells (or CAR T cells) for immune cancer therapy. Supported by Design of Experiment (DoE), proteomics and metabolomics will be applied to evaluate and determine the key bioproduction process parameters (such as stirred-tank parameters, media, supplements, etc.) to control T cell metabolism and cell growth. The oxygen transfer coefficient-based scale-up strategy will be developed to guide large-scale manufacturing of T cells, which will be validated using small- and medium- size tank bioreactors with scale-up factor of 10. In addition, at multiple key steps of the cellular bioproduction, the T cell quality control will be established via monitoring and evaluating cellular density, viability, T cell surface markers and functions. The existing T cell biomanufacturing in flask, LifeCell bag or Wave bag is limited by the weaknesses of lot-to-lot variation, heterologous product quality during scale-up, and low reproducibility. The proposed approach, i.e. MCPE-based fed-batch T cell production in stirred-tank bioreactor, that enables homogenous cell expansion, high cell density, high viability and good product quality in large-scale T cell manufacturing would be a major methodological advance for the field. Moreover, the systems biology approach will help advance the knowledge of host cell protein expression and intracellular metabolite profiling of human T cells under various culture conditions. In addition, the liquid activators in this proposed strategy will avoid heterologous suspension culture, improve cell growth efficiency, simplify manufacturing operation and reduce production cost. The critical scale-up factors learned from this application will guide future large-scale T cell biomanufacturing. Finally, the quality control at multiple stages of the process development will help identify potential product quality and process scale-up pain points during T cell bioproduction. To the PI's best knowledge, this is the first effort to rationally develop T cell bioproduction process via understanding the interaction between cellular metabolism and process parameters."

Dynamic friction plays a pivotal role in how earthquake ruptures propagate along pre-existing faults in the Earth's crust, such as the San Andreas Fault in California, and release waves that cause destructive shaking. Yet, the fundamental structure and evolution of dynamic friction is still one of the main uncertainties in earthquake science. The proposed study will enhance our understanding of dynamic friction and hence of earthquake source physics. By improving friction formulations for earthquake-producing faults, this study strives to produce a key ingredient for dynamic rupture simulations and physics-based assessment of seismic hazard.<br/><br/>The study will investigate dynamic friction using laboratory experiments, featuring dynamic ruptures spontaneously propagating along a frictional interface. The researchers will employ a digital image correlation technique in combination with high-speed photography to characterize in real time the full-field evolution of displacements, velocities, and stresses, and of friction along rupturing interfaces. The addition of rock gouge&#8232;to the interface of the samples in some experiments will further increase the relevance of the setup to earthquake problems. Furthermore, plans to study friction evolution at locations where a fault meets a free surface and where fault-normal stresses vary rapidly and significantly, will allow tests for recent ideas of shear resistance not being directly proportional to rapid variations in normal stress but rather evolving to such proportionality with slip. The work will also explore the effect of fluids in faulting by conducting&#8232;experiments with fluid injection and studying the regime in which the injection triggers dynamic events. The obtained friction data will help to evaluate and improve the existing dynamic friction formulations by introducing the appropriate new physics in to existing formalisms and by even suggesting new and improved dynamic frictional laws. The inferred friction formulations will be verified by forward simulations of our experimental setup."

The increasing importance and proliferation of video in the educational arena and other domains strategically places this project at the vanguard of scientific discovery in building a technology tool that will serve society. Outside the field of education, this project will impact workplaces where videos are used by individuals or groups as part of training, analysis or assessment such as corporate/manufacturing, legal/criminal justice, medical and others. The project holds a patent and is situated as a spin-out from a university. It has unlimited potential for national and international commercialization, thus generating tax revenue and creating jobs.  <br/><br/>This project focuses on the development of a commercial-ready Video Collaboratory platform for team-based learning and collaboration centered on video documents for the Lightweight Teams model for group learning. This project will develop support tools for the management of teams of learners, mechanisms for inter-team collaboration, selective cross-team propagation of annotations, and team-based analytics, including instructor dashboard metrics for video engagement monitoring. The goal of the project is to address knowledge gaps identified in tools to support video-centered collaboration, targeting the flipped classroom model for STEM higher education. In this context it is essential to understand and support best practice mechanisms for automated group creation, bidirectional discourse proliferation for large class sizes and measurement of engagement and effectiveness for video content. The project's subaward team will be responsible for development and testing of technical feasibility aspects of the proposed research milestones. For each of the research milestones, the team will analyze the data from prototype deployments at the University and from other beta testers. Formative evaluation will be conducted through analysis of log files, informal interviews and focus groups with beta testers. Based on the feedback, a coded prototype will be created and tested on the test server before final deployment to the production system."

The goal of this project is to lay the algorithmic foundation for tightly integrating 3D scanning and digital fabrication, to support new applications in life sciences and medicine.  To this end, the research will transform the traditional geometry processing pipeline by proposing a new data representation and new algorithms specifically designed to support fabrication and scanning.  In contrast to traditional global optimization methods, which struggle to deal with massive and noisy datasets, the PI focuses on semi-local algorithms that are robust, easy to parallelize and have a small memory footprint.  The research will have two major thrusts: Scanning for Fabrication (ScanFab), and Fabrication for Scanning (FabScan).  The ScanFab pipeline will support medical applications that require the design of customized medical devices and prostheses; to validate its effectiveness, the PI will collaborate with corporate partner Sonova to acquire and reconstruct the geometry of the ear canal, and to provide interactive techniques for designing the next generation of customized hearing aids.  The FabScan thrust will lead to the development of a novel microscopy technique for estimating 2D and 3D traction forces on the surface of cells, which will be fundamental to understanding cell migration in development and cancer genesis; the technique will be developed in collaboration with the Dept. of Mechanical and Process Engineering at ETH Zurich, and will be evaluated in a large biological study in collaboration with the medical school in the University of Milano.  The developed techniques will be integrated into the PI's open-source library, to allow the research community to directly benefit from these contributions.<br/><br/>In ScanFab, the PI introduces an integrated pipeline to acquire, modify, simulate, and fabricate a variant of an existing 3D object.  The pipeline is based on T-meshes, a geometrical representation that combines the benefits of coarse and highly structured quadrilateral meshes with the efficiency and flexibility of triangle meshes.  The research will tackle: (1) the interactive and out-of-core conversion of point clouds to T-meshes; (2) the interactive editing of the reconstructed surfaces while ensuring fabricability; (3) the physical simulation of the new geometry to study its mechanical properties before fabrication, using a Finite Element Method (FEM).  In FabScan, the pipeline will be reversed to sense forces at the microscopic level.  The PI will fabricate a microstructure with a known geometry and physical properties, apply loads to it, and then acquire the deformed geometry via 3D confocal microscopy.  The traction forces will be accurately reconstructed by solving an inverse FEM problem, combining the knowledge of the initial and of the deformed geometry."

Many of the mechanisms that provide spatial and temporal control over morphogenesis are conserved in all animals, yet knowledge is still lacking on how these processes work. For example, the current understanding of mechanisms that allow mechanical forces to propagate through a tissue is inadequate to fully explain morphogenesis in many developmental events. Thus investigating these control mechanisms in a simple model organism such as the fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) provide understanding of basic developmental processes that are shared by all animals. The Ward lab has identified a number of proteins that appear to function together in several morphogenetic events during embryogenesis in the fly. This research focuses on the molecular functions of these proteins in generating and propagating mechanical forces through a tissue during embryogenesis. In addition to the scientific advancements that will result from this study, this project will increase the participation of first generation and underrepresented minority high school and college students in authentic scientific research. Specifically, the PI will develop a new program to engage high school students from Kansas City, KS in a summer-long research experience centered on using model system genetics to study development. The PI is also a mentor for several programs aimed at increasing the participation of underrepresented groups in the sciences at the University of Kansas, including teaching a course on developing skills to apply to graduate school in STEM disciplines.<br/><br/>Morphogenetic events are triggered and controlled by developmentally-regulated signaling pathways that lead to actomyosin dynamics in individual cells. These forces must then be propagated through the epithelium and maintained in order to elicit appropriate tissue-level morphological changes. Although much is known about actomyosin dynamics, less is known about the cellular mechanisms involved in force propagation through a tissue. In preliminary studies, the PI determined that a large collection of genes that encode core septate junction (SJ) components are required for embryonic morphogenetic events in the fly. The SJ is a large protein complex that functions as an occluding junction. Importantly, the requirement for these genes occurs prior to the formation of the occluding junction, indicating a novel function for these proteins in morphogenesis. The overall goal of this project is to provide mechanistic understanding of how SJ proteins facilitate morphogenetic processes during dorsal closure (DC), a well-studied developmental event that occurs midway through Drosophila embryogenesis. The following aims will be addressed: (1) to determine if SJ proteins regulate the assembly and dynamics of actomyosin complexes during DC, (2) to determine if SJ proteins are required for biomechanical or adhesive functions during DC, and (3) to determine if SJ proteins are required to maintain apical/basal polarity. Actomyosin dynamics will be examined by live imaging and on fixed tissues with antibodies that reveal activated myosin complexes, while biomechanical properties will be probed by laser microsurgery experiments."

However, these processes are exceedingly difficult to measure directly in the ocean, with no satisfactory methods currently available to quantify their full impact. The researchers undertaking this project have developed a unique, field instrument referred to as the Eddy Covariance H+ and O2 Exchange System (ECHOES). These novel measurements of hydrogen ion (H+) and oxygen (O2) exchange between the seafloor and the overlying seawater will allow unique, direct evaluation of the important linked biological and chemical reactions. Data from ECHOES will transform understanding of the potentially critical contribution of seafloor processes to the resilience of coastal ecosystems experiencing rapid changes in seawater chemistry. Results from this project will provide critical data for improved models of the consequences of coastal acidification.  Additionally, this project will fund an early career scientist and the mentorship of undergraduate students in ocean science research through the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute's Summer Student Fellowship Program.<br/><br/>Laboratory experiments have successfully examined the benthic response of individual organisms and chemical reactions to stress related to changing seawater chemistry but the integrated response of intact ecosystems has been very difficult to quantify due to unsatisfactory methods for in situ measurements of the required suite of biogeochemical fluxes. This deployment of ECHOES at a variety of carbonate-dominated seafloor sites in Bermuda is a pioneering effort to simultaneously measure net community production (NCP) and net community calcification (NCC). The study will focus on traditionally difficult-to-study systems including complex reefs, vertical seagrass canopies, and bare permeable sediments, evaluating diel variability, patchiness, and the impact of upstream fluxes on downstream ecosystems. Important biogeochemical parameters (e.g. pH, CO2, O2, alkalinity, etc.) in these productive shallow environments can experience daily fluctuations over a greater dynamic range than 100-year model projections for the open ocean due to increasing atmospheric CO2. Therefore, the novel field data generated by this research will help define the potentially critical and heretofore ill-defined role for shallow, productive carbonate sediments in predictive models of ecosystem response to ocean acidification."

Relevant length scales range from the size of ocean basins down to the millimeters where turbulent dissipation occurs. Time scales of interest are as small as seconds to climate fluctuations of decades or centuries. A relatively new approach to address the challenges of sampling this broad range of scale is to use autonomous platforms, defined here as being unconnected either to a ship or the seafloor. The trends in autonomous and Lagrangian platforms and sensors (ALPS) have been apparent for some time. This recognition led to the initial NSF-sponsored ALPS workshop in 2003 and it is timely to revisit its findings. In 2003, the Argo array had only 900 floats on its way to the current array of more than 3500. Underwater gliders were being developed, but no real science had been done with them yet. Propeller-driven AUVs were beginning to deliver results. A wide range of biogeochemical sensors was discussed at the meeting, mostly as possibilities, although there were some results from floats. Many of the predictions in the ALPS report have proven to be accurate, with a marked increase in the number of scientists using autonomous platforms to address research problems. The ALPS-II meeting will take place at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography, during 21-24 February 2017.The outcome of ALPS-II will be broadly shared with the ocean scientific community. In pursuit of this objective, the meeting will be as open as possible subject to the limited number of on-site participants. A website will make publically available all meeting materials, including the final report. The plenary sessions will be broadcast on the internet. Importantly, all workshop participants will be encouraged to consider the interests of the broader community in their contributions. Meeting recommendations are expected to include means to make ALPS technologies accessible to more scientists. If fully successful, the results of the meeting will be a catalyst towards the adoption of ALPS widely throughout the ocean community, both for research and operations.<br/><br/>This second ALPS science and technology review has the overarching goals (1) to survey progress in the past 13 years, and (2) to assess future prospects. The meeting will examine the ALPS enterprise through a sequence of slices through a rapidly growing field. The history and potential of the various platforms (drifters, floats, gliders, autonomous underwater vehicles, autonomous surface vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles) will be addressed. The various classes of sensors including physical, biogeochemical, optical, acoustic, etc. will be reviewed with special attention to their use on autonomous platforms. The scientific problems amenable to ALPS technologies will be discussed including global and regional issues, high latitudes, ocean acidification, and climate variability. The value of ALPS in ocean forecasting will be a topic of interest, including approaches for adaptive sampling and control. Models for managing and operating ALPS assets will be discussed, with the goal of making the technologies available to more scientists. This brief list of topics is neither exhaustive nor prescriptive, as meeting participants will have latitude to guide the meeting."

As testers cannot know what faults exist apriori, dozens of metrics---ranging from the measurement of structural coverage to the detection of synthetic faults---have been proposed to judge test case adequacy. In theory, if such metrics are fulfilled, tests should be adequate at detecting faults. To alleviate the high cost of testing, optimization algorithms can be used to automatically generate test suites. These adequacy metrics are well-suited for guiding automated test creation. However, there is no adequacy metric known to universally correspond to ""effective fault detection.'' Testers are left with a bewildering number of testing options, and there is little guidance on when to use one criterion over another. These metrics are a solid starting point for test case generation. Many faults cannot be detected until the code has been executed. However, merely executing code does not ensure adequate testing. How code is executed is important. It is clear that testers do not yet understand which adequacy metrics actually correspond to a high probability of fault detection, or under what situations these metrics can be applied.<br/><br/>Therefore, it is clear that improving automated test generation requires gaining a better understanding of the circumstances where particular metrics are effective, isolating the features of such metrics that correlate to fault detection in such circumstances, and establishing and evaluating guidelines for the use and combination of metrics - perhaps tied to particular system types or domains - that will result in real-world fault detection. Large-scale empirical investigations will be performed into the nature of the relationship between adequacy criteria and the probability of fault detection in order to understand the efficacy and applicability of the criteria that are used to guide test creation. This work will have broader impacts on industrial practices, software engineering education, and - through dissemination to and collaborations with industrial partners and regulatory agencies - public safety and security."

Plasmas are ionized gases which can be activated with electric fields which energize electrons. Through electron collisions with molecules, LTPs are able to efficiently generate chemically reactive gases, which in turn create new functionality through creating new compounds or adding/removing material from surfaces. Recent breakthroughs in plasma-generating electronics have made it possible to develop novel systems to widen the area of LTP applications at atmospheric and higher pressures (even in liquids) to utilize this chemical reactivity. This new ability has stimulated the interest of industries such as food processing, agriculture, fuel conversion medical, water treatment, and pharmaceutical industries to apply LTPs to improve the efficiency of processing or create new processes. The use of LTPs in these industries for advanced technologies is now restricted by limited scientific understanding of the fundamental underpinnings of the applications.<br/><br/>Drexel University and the University of Michigan are planning to establish a National Science Foundation Industry/University Cooperative Research Center (I/UCRC) that focuses on leveraging the chemical activation power of LTPs to new technologies. The academic researchers in the Center will investigate the fundamental scientific basis of LTPs as used in the energy, environmental remediation, water treatment, food safety and processing, and medical and bioengineering sectors. Through collaboration with industrial members of the Center, these fundamental principles will be translated into improving and creating new technologies to address the food-water-energy nexus and to improve human health. In addition to helping to enable industry to address critical societal needs, these improvements in technology will create economic opportunities."

Its unpredictable performance, energy, and cost benefits can adversely affect productivity, efficiency, and profit in data centers. Though promising, this technical transition can fundamentally change the decades-long memory and storage system design assumptions and introduce critical design challenges. For example, new performance landscape can change the energy efficiency model of data centers and break the existing load balance across various system resources; traditional data reliability schemes can become suboptimal due to the discrepant failure patterns and reliability issues of new memory technologies; current applications and system software may not fully exploit the benefits offered by persistent memory. <br/><br/>This research focuses on enhancing the performance, energy-efficiency, and reliability of data center storage system by fully exploiting the potential of persistent memory. The central approach is to rethink data center architecture design strategies and memory/storage stack management, making them persistent memory aware. The project devises fundamental techniques in efficiency modeling, load balancing of critical system resources, and low-cost reliability guarantee across single server memory/storage stack and distributed storage systems. The project also enhances a set of key data center applications by leveraging persistent memory. It is expected that research ideas developed in this project will enable significantly improved access performance, energy efficiency, reliability, and lifetime in data center memory and storage systems, taking a large step in making our daily lives more productive."

Cooperation is needed to solve difficult societal problems, sustain shared social systems and resources (common-pool resources), and provide essential goods and services (public goods). Society's governance systems promote cooperation by protecting shared interests, encouraging people to follow rules, and reducing conflicts. Widespread and sustained cooperation, however, is not guaranteed. Recent world events show many examples of cooperative failures (e.g., global conflict, political upheaval, environmental degradation, and resource scarcity). The psychological mechanisms involved in cooperative decision making must be better understood to develop more effective solutions to these problems. The current research project examines the psychological processes associated with three important aspects of governance: communication, democratic decision making (e.g., voting), and enforcement (e.g., monitoring and financial punishments). The goal is to understand (a) when and why these governance mechanisms improve cooperation, or hinder it, and (b) what motivates groups of people to self-govern, creating their own effective solutions for shared problems. The research project looks at five core aspects of social cognition that influence people's group commitment and policy acceptance: perceptions of governmental legitimacy, satisfaction of fundamental needs (e.g., fair decision making, security), perceived reasons others act the way they do (causal attributions), group identity (e.g., liking, trust), and intrinsic and extrinsic motivations. By studying these fundamental aspects of social cognition, this research seeks to identify core principles of cooperation (e.g., enforcement must be legitimized) that can better explain cooperative failures in society (e.g., why regulatory systems sometimes backfire), reconcile competing theories in social science, and improve public policy. The project is mentoring many graduate and undergraduate students, with diverse backgrounds, in research design, data collection, analyses, and communication. Educational resources based on this research are incorporated into a new decision-making course, existing courses in sustainability and experimental economics, and developed for elementary schools. These materials are shared for public use. A free podcast series is created to share important concepts, research designs, and results with the public and scientific community; these podcasts also discuss societal implications, in light of major world events.  <br/><br/>The research team conducts five interdisciplinary lab experiments in 5 years. Groups manage a shared resource simulated on the computer in VCWeb (Virtual Commons software), earning money based on their harvests. Surveys measure motivations and perceptions corresponding to each of the five fundamental social cognitions. Experiment 1 examines (a) how communication improves cooperation and (b) the motivations involved in voluntary cooperation and self-organization. Participants will complete the resource governance task in different phases, with and without communication. Psychological effects of communication are correlated with observed levels of cooperation, and used to develop principles for institutional design and public policy. Experiment 2 assesses both communication and enforcement (economic sanctions). This study also examines how non-punitive aspects of enforcement (e.g., justification of sanctions, rehabilitative techniques) improve enforcement and counteract potentially harmful side-effects. Experiment 3 investigates how different voting processes potentially justify, or legitimize enforcement. This experiment clarifies when and how democratic processes and enforcement enhance one another. Experiment 4 examines how preferences for different governance systems (e.g., voting mechanisms) change over time, identifying core motivations that drive institutional evolution and dynamic fluctuations in cooperation. Experiment 5 tests boundary conditions and integrates key findings across each experiment. All results are related to a core theory of how fundamental needs contribute to group commitment, policy acceptance, and voluntary cooperation."

This will lead to generalized techniques for data-driven modeling and optimization of the process of designing such systems, reducing the workload necessary to create successful ones and broadening the scope of problem domains to which massive amounts of human brainpower can be applied. Despite the vast computational power currently available, a broad range of important problems still rely on human reasoning or intuition to solve. In cases where algorithms are either unknown or computationally intractable, human computation has recently arisen as a means to apply human skills to advance solutions to problems neither humans nor computers could solve alone. By bringing human creativity, problem solving, and perspective to bear, humans and computers combined can solve previously unsolvable problems. Additionally, these systems create a new pathway for involvement in science - a new way for people to contribute towards problems that are important to them. By democratizing science, we involve those who may not otherwise have had such a means. Finally, this research can contribute to our understanding of how to best train people in solving challenging problems.<br/> <br/>This work seeks to automate one aspect of the iterative refinement of human computation systems: improving the assignment of tasks to contributors. The basic approach is to construct a model of contributors and tasks, based on skill ratings and skill chains, which can be used to assign contributors an appropriate task to complete. This model will automatically refine the skill estimates and assignments over time based on data, improving both user experience and problem solving outcomes. This approach in broken down into three challenge areas: 1) developing a unified skill model that combines skill atoms and skill ratings, then using that skill model for 2) crafting a difficulty curve tailored for each participant, and 3) evaluating design decisions. The approach will build on existing multi-person matchmaking systems, validated in multiple human computation systems."

The goal is to provide better algorithms for several key problems that are studied in combinatorial optimization. Practical applications of approximation algorithms can be found in many areas of science and industry. Moreover, this proposal includes the integration of research and teaching by means of graduate courses that cover the Lasserre hierarchy in a manner accessible for graduate students outside of theoretical computer science.<br/> <br/>More concretely, the goal is to develop approximation algorithms based on the Lasserre SDP for outstanding unsolved problems like Directed Steiner Tree, Graph Coloring, Unrelated Machine Scheduling and Unique Games.

A key ingredient will be the development of a better understanding of the vector embeddings for higher moments that are provided by the Lasserre SDP. <br/><br/>Keywords: Approximation algorithms; Semidefinite programs; Integrality gaps; Lasserre hierarchy"

In recent years, character animation has taken tremendous strides towards realistic virtual agents, with increasingly better solutions for body motion capture, for achieving highly realistic facial animation, and for simulating cloth and hair.  With these key components in place, the need to create plausible hand and finger motions has become important because these play a crucial role in communicating information while also allowing us to conduct basic tasks and to handle complex tools.  But the differences in size and complexity of hand motions compared to body motions make it difficult to capture or synthesize both at the same time.  Therefore, finger motions are typically still animated manually, which is a cumbersome process.  Taking advantage of perceptual findings could enable the creation of new algorithms to accomplish this task (e.g., by suggesting new methods and by aiding in algorithm parameter adjustment).  The ultimate goal of this research is to merge character animation and motion perception into an interdisciplinary field that yields new insights and approaches to finger and hand movement synthesis as well as a better understanding of how we communicate.    If successful, the work will significantly advance the way we design algorithms to bring virtual characters to life, and project outcomes will have broad impact not only in computer graphics but also in applications such as virtual reality, robotics and prosthetics.  The project includes integrated educational and outreach activities for K-12, undergraduate, and graduate students.  <br/><br/>This research will initiate a fundamental transformation of how we design algorithms for character animation by coupling perceptual experiments with computer animation algorithm development for hand and finger motion synthesis.  Several approaches and devices have been suggested for hand and finger animation, each with their own drawbacks. Some of these approaches show promise and could be improved or combined, but the options are many and a more systematic approach is required.  This work will focus on two applications: data-driven hand motion synthesis for virtual characters, and hand motions for interaction and communication in virtual reality.  The plan is to develop an algorithm for hand motion synthesis based on segment and pose matching, on perceptual insights on the relevance of finger poses and dynamics, and on the perception of collisions, to support real-time interaction in virtual reality."

For example, the broader impact/commercial potential of this I-Corps project can be associated with giving chemical process designers access to modern optimization techniques. While critical to all chemical companies, optimizing the design of a chemical process (in terms of choosing the process temperatures, pressures, flow rates, etc., that give the best economic performance) is still largely carried out empirically by design engineers. The workflow is typically iterative, labor-intensive and time-consuming, and the optimality of the outcome is not guaranteed. The proposed activity will place at the fingertips of engineers in the chemical, petrochemical, natural gas and other process industries a new computational framework that uses rigorous optimization tools to find the best process design. The commercial potential ranges from increasing the number of process alternatives that can be considered at the design stage, to supporting optimal investment decisions in new production facilities or upgrading existing ones. The proposed activity also has important potential societal impact: investment in US-based chemical production facilities (spurred by recent developments in accessing domestic shale gas and oil resources) will create new jobs and advance the training and development of the current and future workforce engaged in the design and operation of chemical plants.<br/><br/>Applying rigorous optimization tools to solve process design optimization problems has been hindered by numerical challenges posed by solving the process model - a set of very nonlinear equations corresponding to material and energy balances for reactors, distillation towers, heat exchangers, etc. found in a chemical  and other process plant. The project relies on a recently-invented computational approach for solving and optimizing process flowsheet models. The approach involves a systematic mathematical reformulation of the model equations, resulting in equivalent expressions that can be solved reliably using common numerical methods. A library of unit operation models which can be linked together to create a mathematical model of an entire process is also available, and has been extensively validated on the design optimization of academic and industrial test problems. The commercialization of this work will bridge the large gap that currently exists between industrial practice and the numerous recent advances in optimization theory."

In these plasmas, collisions between charged particles are rare. As a result, plasma waves are a major means of transferring energy from one charged particle population to another. Charged particles ""surf"" the waves. To first order, those that are moving slightly faster than the waves are energized, while those moving slower lose energy to the waves causing them to grow. There are a wide variety of plasma waves with different properties and different source mechanisms. Three of these (plasmaspheric hiss, chorus, and electromagnetic ion cyclotron (EMIC) waves) are widely believed to play significant roles in the depletion of the electron radiation belts but how this happens and how each contributes with local time and radial distance are still-open and strongly debated questions of fundamental importance. During their interactions with the waves, electrons are scattered out of their trapped orbits and sent on trajectories into the dense atmosphere where they are lost through collisions. The work will independently examine experimental observations and, most importantly, use theoretical tools to understand the interactions leading to the precipitation. The science questions to be addressed in this proposal are particularly important, since electron precipitation leads to chemical changes in the upper atmosphere, and is critical in regulating ring current and radiation belt electron dynamics. The grant will support the further training and development of a promising female early-career scientist. The results will be useful to the broader space physics and upper atmosphere communities, to researchers studying the chemistry of the middle atmosphere, and for space environment applications, such as active mitigation techniques for both natural and artificial radiation in space.<br/><br/>Testing theoretical ideas about particular wave-particle interactions and the variations in the space environment that effect them has been difficult because the waves are measured at large radial distances in the magnetosphere while the electron precipitation that they produce must be viewed from low-earth orbit. To complicate matters, the mix of plasma waves depends on the radial distance and magnetic local time but in addition is an as yet to be determined function of the severity of space weather storming, and the phase of the storm. The principal investigator (PI) has developed an innovative technique to analyze the physical relationship between wave intensity and wave-driven electron pitch angle scattering loss, which can be directly implemented using conjugate observations from near-equatorial and low-altitude satellites. This project, which uses both theory and observation, will provide a definitive understanding of the quantitative contribution of each type of plasma wave to electron precipitation within various energy ranges and in different L-MLT regions. The results will provide a highly important contribution to our wider understanding of the mechanisms that regulate the hazardous radiation environment surrounding the Earth."

The additive manufacturing industry exceeds $5 billion in 2015 and is expected to top $20 billion within the next five years. It has become an extremely competitive area of research in countries around the world. To ensure US' global leadership in this emerging field originated from the US, academic partners (currently including Georgia Institute of Technology (GT), University of Connecticut (UConn), and University of Massachusetts Lowell (UML)) have come together to create the Center for Science of Heterogeneous Additive Printing of 3D Materials (SHAP3D). SHAP3D will serve the diverse interests of industry, government, and academia by addressing fundamental research challenges to meet the commercial needs of industry for 3D printing of heterogeneous materials. SHAP3D will develop the critical and necessary insight into fundamental processing-structure-property relationships to predict and control the integration of diverse materials for 3D printing. The work of SHAP3D will be critical as the industry adopts 3D printing for product prototyping, tooling, and higher volume manufacturing with three specific economic outcomes. First, the Center will pursue higher performance materials and composites that enable diverse and lighter weight products to minimize total life cycle costs and environmental footprint. Second, in order to minimize processing costs, the Center will explore more optimal and parallel processes to more quickly print products with higher resolution. Third, SHAP3D will investigate interfacial physics and design concepts for integrating dissimilar materials to facilitate multi-functional components/products, broaden the number of 3D printed applications, and increase market size. Active collaboration with industry partners will ensure relevance to education and training of the future workforce to expedite the adoption and integration of 3D printing methods into manufacturing processes. The three institutions will create a scholarship fund specifically for the recruitment of diverse graduate students.  A portion of this scholarship fund will be directed to underrepresented students from minority serving institutions, including community colleges.  UML educational programs associated with this IUCRC target undergraduate and graduate students at UML and local community colleges, K-12 students, and industry professionals.  Modules on additive manufacturing will be developed and delivered for existing undergraduate and graduate courses, for on-line teaching, and for industrial seminars.  Modules will be modified for K-12 students, with undergraduate students in the UTeach program introducing additive manufacturing at local high schools and to K-12 students. Undergraduates will have opportunities to perform research through specific projects, UML's Co-op Scholar program (for freshman and sophomores), senior capstone projects, and UML's programs to allow undergraduate and graduate students to spend three to six-month-long periods at the Center's industry partners' facilities.  <br/><br/>The SHAP3D Center will perform research to understand the synthesis, properties, and processing of heterogeneous materials for integration into complex, additively manufactured products.  The work SHAP3D envisions would encompass many different additive printing methods, such as fused deposition modeling (FDM), selective laser sintering (SLS), stereolithography (SLA), poly/ink jet, and other additive approaches. The Center will perform fundamental material modeling and processing research to establish and translate validated materials and processes to students and practitioners. The proposed center will enable: (i) the rational design and creation of new material feedstocks and, (ii) the understanding of material properties, protocols, and design rules that must be characterized and developed to optimize the process and predict the properties of products and parts created from multiple polymer materials (e.g., different constituent materials, fillers/additives, and interfaces).  UML is internationally known for its plastics engineering program with its interdisciplinary integration of synthesis, characterization, processing, and design. Participating faculty members at UML will provide research polymer/plastic materials, their product design and processing. Collaboration among faculty provides the capability to go from ?art to part? and convert product design concepts to reality, and also to research and develop the industry supply chain for the polymeric materials, compounded feedstock, molds/tools, as well as the plastics conversion machinery and sensors."

The case of emergency medical responders is intriguing and oftentimes problematic. As public service providers, they are street-level bureaucrats who work on the frontlines of the post-9/11 security state, facing political, legal and ethical collisions between the security of the communities where they live and work and their social-humanitarian responsibilities to saving lives. Professional ethics and healthcare laws require that first responders provide help without regard to the legal status of their patients, but as state actors they are also invested with political and symbolic functions of governmental authority and tightly integrated into the federal emergency preparedness and homeland security infrastructures. The study examines the relation between local governments and taxpayers that fund fire, rescue and emergency medical services, and federal and state governments, which set and implement national security, border control and immigration policies. The project will be instructive to EMS-related policy and regulatory efforts as they relate to both broader concerns about national security and public health.

This project asks: (1) what effects do security policies, planned and executed at different government levels, have in the communities where they are applied? And (2) how do potential contradictions that result when these policies are put into practice impact border security efforts? Dr. Jusionyte will seek answers to these questions by engaging in a twelve-month-long ethnographic research in rural and urban communities of Southern Arizona, where she will actively collaborate with research assistants and community partners from the fire and rescue departments. The research team will conduct a series of in-depth interviews, focus group discussions and archival research in order to explain how conflicting policies at different levels of governance can result in potentially deleterious consequences for people who experience them, and assess the implications that these effects have on first responders as frontline state actors. This research is an original and important contribution to our understanding of the effects of security-making and the laws, politics and ethics of rescue from an anthropological perspective.&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;&#8194;"

How lightning originates inside thunderclouds and propagates through air is a longstanding fundamental problem in the field of atmospheric electricity. It has been suggested that there are three critical steps in lightning initiation and propagation: initiation and propagation of streamers that are relatively cold plasma channels, transition from streamers to bright, hot, highly conductive leaders, and propagation of leaders. Recent studies have firmly established that streamers can be initiated from thundercloud hydrometeors subject to the maximum thundercloud electric field measured so far. However, the other two steps of lightning initiation and propagation remain poorly understood. It is unknown whether the streamers originating from thundercloud hydrometeors will be able to generate the first leader at their stem, and if they can, how the streamer-to-leader transition occurs and how this transition depends on thundercloud conditions such as thundercloud charge and field. In addition, experiments and observations have indicated that the most common type of lightning leaders called negative leaders develops in a stepping manner. Perhaps being one of the most ""mysterious"" phenomena in atmospheric electricity, luminous blob structures known as ""space stems"" are found to appear in front of the negative leader tip and they develop into bidirectional ""space leaders"" to support the stepping propagation of negative leaders. There is currently no theory that offers an explanation for the formation of space stems and space leaders.<br/><br/>The objective of the project is to develop an advanced computer model and code to study lightning initiation and propagation. A three-dimensional computer code, that includes all required plasma kinetic and gas dynamic components to self-consistently model streamer propagation, leader initiation, and formation of space stems and space leaders, will be developed. With the developed model and code, the following research activities will be conducted: (1) investigating the characteristics of long (>10 cm) streamers propagating in electric fields near or greater than the streamer propagation threshold fields, (2) studying the initiation of streamers from the trail of an expanding, accelerating streamer of opposite polarity and its implications for the formation of space stems and space leaders, and (3) investigating air heating in the channels of streamers originating from hydrometeors, the possibility of the formation of the first leader channel at their stem, and the formation of space stems and space leaders in front of a negative leader.<br/><br/>Intellectual Merit :<br/>Intellectual merit of these activities is defined by the direct attack on one of the most challenging problems in lightning research and by the investigation of the least-understood processes of lightning.

A key element of the research is the use of extremely small catalyst particles (containing only several hundred atoms) that are partially coated with a protective layer of molecules called dendrimers that keep the metal particles from coalescing. A variety of catalysts are being made, and their structures and catalytic activities are being analyzed. Computational studies are being performed to predict new catalyst structures that are then prepared and analyzed; the results from the experimental studies are used to refine the computational methods. The combined approach represents a new toolkit for the discovery and development of new catalytic materials having improved performance.The project participants are involved in educational and outreach activities to engage undergraduate students directly in various aspects of the project including an opportunity for some of the University of Texas - Austin students to spend up to a week at Brookhaven National Laboratory and the University of Pittsburgh. <br/><br/>The research team is conducting density functional theory (DFT) calculations of the entire nanoparticle structure for various combinations of metals - one which adsorbs carbon monoxide and one which adsorbs oxygen dissociatively. The DFT calculations of available reaction mechanisms, together with kinetic modeling and correlations to expected variations in catalyst structures and compositions, identify mechanisms and reactivity descriptors that will be used in subsequent screening-synthesis-characterization-evaluation cycles. Characterizations are being conducted by both in situ and scanning transmission electron microscopy (TEM/STEM) and extended X-ray absorption fine structure (EXAFS). Methods are being developed for combining the DFT calculations with the TEM and EXAFS data to improve the determination of nanoparticle structures at the atomic scale. From a scientific/technical standpoint, the study is advancing the dendrimer-aided approach to catalyst synthesis, with a clearer understanding of the nature of the particles that are produced and their catalytic activity. The study is extending previous work on bi-metallic particles to metal-metal oxide systems, with corresponding extension of computational and characterization efforts. The synthesis, characterization, and modeling tools developed during the course of this study have broad applicability to a wide range of reactions and catalyst formulations, and the software tools will be freely distributed to the catalysis science community."

The data acquisition is usually under-prescribed and noisy. The sampling domains and/or processing domains may not be well suited for the underlying question. All of these make the problems ill-posed, and various regularization techniques are necessary to study the problems by formulating them as convex optimization models.

(2) How quickly and in what sense does the approximation converge? (3) Are the corresponding numerical algorithms developed for the fidelity and regularization terms viable? (4) How well are perturbations from the original data tolerated? The project aims to provide answers to all of these questions."

In 2011, 13% of children enrolled in schools in the United States required some form of special education; in 2010, 1 in 68 children in the U.S. was diagnosed with some form of autism spectrum disorder (ASD), a developmental condition that almost always triggers the need for special education.  A significant amount of robotics research over the past decade has indicated that many children with ASD have a strong interest in robotic toys, and suggested that robots are potentially valuable tools in special education for these children.  But the clinical community and educators, who have the authority to approve the use of such devices in special education, remain unconvinced.  One reason for this gap is that the robotics research in this domain has not had a strong focus on effectiveness.  The PI recently completed a preliminary study involving children with ASD that confirmed the clinical feasibility of special education service delivery through human-robot interaction (HRI).  Her goal in the current project is to establish a research program that builds on these findings to develop a framework, including methods and algorithms, for robot-mediated special education service delivery to children with ASD and other disorders of a similar nature.  The PI's vision is to lay the foundations for a future where educators deliver services in collaboration with robots, thereby making a significant impact by increasing the effectiveness of special education services while reducing the burden on the educator during the service delivery process.<br/><br/>This research proposes a ""Learning from Demonstration"" (LfD) approach where the robot learns service delivery from a series of demonstrations by human educators in real special education scenarios.  When the human educator has sufficient confidence in the robot's ability, s/he will initiate a collaborative service delivery scenario in which the robot autonomously delivers some steps of a specific educational service but  asks for the educator's assistances in cases where it has low confidence in its perception and/or planned actions.  A multi-modal activity recognition framework will provide information about the responses and activities of children with special needs as they engage with the robot.  To facilitate educator/robot interaction, a focus group will be organized with educators and clinicians to accommodate their needs and expectations in the design of the control interface for the special education service delivery robot.  An HRI study will test the effectiveness of the proposed framework in real-world settings.  The design and implementation of robots that can deliver special education services in collaboration with a human educator will open up many opportunities to advance the state of the art in robot learning (especially high-level concept learning), robot vision and activity recognition, and HRI."

The first is the prediction of the demand of bikes at different stations. The second is the optimal bike rebalancing strategy among different stations. The successful prediction of bike demand could help system operators better deploy bikes and redistribute bikes among stations. Effective and optimal bike rebalancing could help meet the dynamic need of bike rental and save system operational costs. Although primarily focusing on bike sharing networks, data analytics capability advanced through this problem should be applicable to problems from other types of distributed rental services.   <br/><br/>This exploratory research project aims to develop effective and scalable data mining and optimization techniques that have the analytical capability to predict bike demand of different stations and to optimize the bike rebalancing strategy among stations. First, this project aims to develop regression-based prediction models that take into account both relevant features and contextual information such as connections among bike sharing stations. Second, this project explores mixed integer nonlinear programming (MINLP) techniques for solving bike rebalancing problem with the objective of minimizing the total travel distance of rebalancing vehicle. While traditional MINLP techniques could not guarantee feasible solutions, the research team aims to develop advanced clustering techniques to first group stations into clusters and then use the clusters to facilitate MINLP. This project also develops appropriate measures for assessing the effectiveness of the developed solutions.

The active layer in polymer-based solar cells is usually prepared by arresting the phase separation of a polymer/fullerene blend.  The structures formed with this non-equilibrium process are difficult to control and accurately characterize, so it is hard to understand how film morphology influences the device efficiency. This award will develop three integrated tasks to investigate the effects of domain size, interfacial area and polymer crystallinity on charge generation, recombination, and transport processes, respectively. First, conductive polymer nanostructures are prepared by electron-beam patterning. These nanostructures are solvent-resistant and thermally-stable, and variables such as nanostructure geometry, polymer crystallinity, and polymer cross-link density are all tunable. Second, the optoelectronic performance of model nanostructure/fullerene solar cells is evaluated with established spectroscopic and device characterization techniques. Last, domain size, interfacial area, and crystallinity are accurately quantified with detailed analysis of X-ray scattering data. A particular focus of this work is interfacial engineering: It is hypothesized that polymer/fullerene interfacial composition profiles can be controlled through polymer cross-link density (in addition to annealing temperature and time), offering a simple route to study the effects of interfaces on charge generation and losses. The knowledge acquired through these systematic studies will identify the optimal design attributes for a benchmark polymer/fullerene system and guide morphology optimization for a variety of high-performance materials. <br/><br/>NON-TECHNICAL SUMMARY: <br/><br/>Polymer-based solar cells show promise for low-cost solar energy conversion, but the technology will not be viable as an alternative source of energy until the power output is improved. This research program facilitates those improvements by establishing a system to study the relationships between active layer structure and electronic function. These findings will help optimize the efficiency of polymer-based solar cells. Education and outreach activities are integrated with this research program in four ways. First, the PI encourages research participation for a diverse pool of high school, undergraduate and graduate students, and participates in numerous K-12 outreach programs that introduce polymer science to under-represented groups in science and engineering. Second, students will be equipped with the necessary skills for multidisciplinary research through a new nanofabrication course and a multi-institutional workshop that will teach the fundamentals of X-ray scattering. Third, through connections to the local Houston materials industry, students will learn about commercialization of polymers for energy conversion and storage. Finally, to enhance the global awareness of student participants, the PI will coordinate complementary research collaborations with the Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology."

This project builds upon that demonstration, by formulating the motion control problem in the setting of stochastic differential equations, in order to create a stochastic control system for 3D motion and swarm control of magnetic microswimmers. Motion control of microswimmers is accomplished with magnetic control and computer vision feedback. Notably, variations in the physical parameters of the individual microswimmers will be leveraged to address uncertainty in the fluid environment. The approach will be used to formulate control and coordination schemes for the motion of a large number of microswimmers in heterogeneous 2D and 3D workspaces, using motion planning and control frameworks that address issues such as controllability and optimality.

To broach the bigger question of the interaction of the subsystems studied by the separate communities, it is necessary to overcome the barriers of communication posed by different observational instruments, software tools for interpreting data, and modeling methods. In answer to this challenge, the Integrated Geoscience Observatory is a pilot project that creates an online platform for integrating data and associated software tools contributed by separate geoscience research communities, into a unified toolset that brings them together. The vision is to expand the individual domains of geoscience research toward study of the whole Sun-Earth system, and in so doing to uncover the system level effects critical to the habitability of planet Earth.<br/><br/>EarthCube aims to develop a framework for assisting researchers in understanding the Earth system. This systems science challenge is recognized in the Decadal Survey in Solar and Space Physics [2012], with the conclusion ""Data from diverse space- and ground-based instruments need to be routinely combined in order to maximize their multi-scale potential."" The Integrated Geoscience Observatory is a pilot project that explores realization of this vision by focusing on the limited context of geospace research. The observatory creates an integrated package of software tools contributed by researchers with specific capabilities, and designed to enable integration of diverse observational data. Features of the toolkit include: (A) linking diverse data sets from multiple data repositories and automatically mapping them to a common user-specified coordinate grid; (B) implementing the well-known Assimilative Mapping of Ionospheric Electrodynamics (AMIE) procedure for assimilation of this data to yield a global picture; and (C) utilization of the EarthCube building blocks GeoSoft, for communicating ontology, and GeoDataspace, for attributing credit to contributors through publication of processed data.

If activity levels remain too high or too low for extended periods of time, the communication between neurons becomes unstable, and, as a consequence, new information cannot be learned. Neurons can alter which proteins are present at specialized sites called synapses, where signals are transmitted from one neuron to another. The way that neurons make these adjustments at the molecular level is poorly understood. Recent work has shown that a protein, referred to as GABAb receptor, causes new proteins to be synthesized by the neuron by a mechanism that involves a second protein, referred to as mTOR. This project will determine how GABAb receptors activate mTOR using cultured rat and mouse neurons. Cultured neurons are the system of choice for visualizing changes in protein synthesis at synapses. The project will determine if the GABAb receptor - mTOR interaction promotes changes in synapse number, which then lead to enhanced communication between neurons. The project will provide training for undergraduates, graduates, and postdoctoral students, including students who are underrepresented in science. It will support development of a new graduate course that trains incoming students in neuroscience laboratory techniques and that gives postdoctoral fellows a formal opportunity to build their teaching skills. Outreach activities are planned through a Community Education Program, Memory Matters.<br/><br/>In the brain, mTOR activity regulates protein synthesis, which is essential for learning and memory. Neurons remodel their synapses (plasticity), to accommodate dramatic changes in activity in order to facilitate new learning (homeostasis). One of the most striking examples of homeostatic plasticity is the formation of new synapses when N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) inputs are blocked, a mechanism thought to require protein synthesis. Recent work from the principal investigator's laboratory has discovered that during NMDAR blockade, GABAb receptors shift from activating post-synaptic potassium channels to increasing L-type calcium channel activity. The rise in calcium channel activity increases mTOR activity in dendrites. This project will use calcium and fluorescent imaging to define the mechanism that shifts GABAb receptor signaling to activate mTOR (Aim 1 and 2). The project will elucidate whether the functional shift of the GABAb receptor is required for structural changes in synapses and synapse number (Aim 3). The project will elucidate whether the functional shift of the GABAb receptor is required for structural changes in synapses and synapse number (Aim 3). This project will offer new insight into molecular mechanisms of homeostatic plasticity."

Because of their potentially recurring nature, floods offer an opportunity for communities to learn from and adapt to these experiences with the goal of increasing resiliency through reflection, modification of former policies, and adoption of new policies. By following the response to the September 2013 floods in Colorado communities, this study will investigate how communities successfully learn from extreme events to increase resilience and decrease vulnerability to future floods. The project seeks to contribute to the fields of public policy and natural hazards research with the following objectives: to advance knowledge of policy learning in the aftermath of extreme events; to advance knowledge of disaster recovery, specifically as it relates to the role that community processes, citizens, and other stakeholders play in promoting long-term recovery and resilience; and to inform governments of lessons from flood responses to the September 2013 floods, with the goal of contributing to the effectiveness of governance in flood-affected communities.<br/><br/>The PIs will conduct longitudinal comparative case studies of seven Colorado communities, located in Colorado's three most severely impacted counties from the September 2013 floods.

In general, this research aims to address challenges on how to best use these inherently large-scale, dynamic, and heterogeneous (multi-source) data streams.  More specifically, the project seeks an innovative systems approach for estimating the statistical properties of traffic flow and travel time via integrating various traffic data pieces over a complex network structure (such as traffic counts collected by fixed sensors and individual ""urban digital footprints"" collected by Bluetooth tag reader logs, cellular phone records, and global positioning system traces).

This problem category has broad applications in transportation, communication, and energy networks; although, the focus in this project is on transportation networks. Built on knowledge in transportation network science, stochastic optimization, variational analysis, and non-parametric estimation, the research team will pursue the following main tasks: (1) Creation of an optimization framework for network identification based on stochastic optimization and non-parametric estimation; (2) Integration of multi-source traffic data (hard information) with domain-knowledge-based soft information via constraints and functional mapping; (3) Linking historical-data-based offline estimation with real-time information for online estimation and decision support through Bayesian methods; (4) Testing and validating the project's methods using both real-world data and computer simulations.  This research establishes a unifying theoretical framework for traffic network identification that integrates knowledge in transportation network science and data analytics. By providing greater modeling flexibility than existing methods in handling various types of hard and soft information and in capturing transportation network physics, this new method ushers a paradigm-shift in traffic network system identification. The project also creates a real-world engineering platform for strengthening connections between optimization and statistics."

In recent years, real-world data across varied fields of science and engineering are increasingly complex, and involve a large number of variables, which has resulted in a surge of scruffier methods. This proposal develops a general ""neat"" framework for such modern settings by leveraging state of the art developments in two of the most popular subfields of machine learning methods: graphical models and high-dimensional statistical methods. These developments have in common that a complex model parameter is expressed as a superposition of simple components, which is then leveraged for tractable inference and learning.<br/><br/>Our unified framework results not only in a unified picture of these developments but also provides newer methods to work with such high-dimensional data. The research thus impacts problems across science and engineering wherever statistical machine learning approaches are being used (such as genomics, natural language processing and image analysis, to name a few). The work on a unified framework for statistical machine learning problems is highly coupled with a push for imparting training to students on what we call ""comptastical"" thinking. This combines both computational and statistical thinking required for addressing the problems of limited computation and limited data inherent in modern statistical AI application domains. The proposal also develops an infrastructure for component-based courses with relationally organized lecture module components."

The project will use results from more than 30 years of research to demonstrate how network supported, group-based learning grounded in principles of Generative Design can improve learning for all learners, across racial/ethnic backgrounds. The project will also offer detailed analyses of activity designs and implementation strategies that will help pre-service teachers to develop more fully participatory and socially-supported approaches to classroom learning, using authentic STEM practices in group-centered learning environments. This work will be particularly important to advancing knowledge in the field for pre-service teacher preparation, since few pre-service programs use this approach in preparing teachers for today?s classrooms.  Through a focus on the initial implementation of twelve model activities taught by pre-service teachers in K-12 classrooms nationwide, this study will also provide concrete and quantitative evidence that group-based learning is both appealing to early-career and induction-years teachers, and that it is feasible to implement in real classrooms.<br/><br/>The project takes a design-based research approach to creating and studying technologies and materials that support generative teaching and learning in STEM.  Sites associated with a nationally recognized and expanding approach to STEM teacher preparation and certification will serve as incubators and testbeds for the project?s innovation and development efforts.  Computational thinking, including agent-based modeling, and simulation across STEM domains as well as geo-spatial reasoning about personally meaningful learner-collected data will provides an important scientific foundation for the project.  This will be achieved by developing a highly-interactive and group-optimized, browser- and cloud-based, device-independent and open-source architecture and by integrating and extending leading computational tools including the NSF-funded NetLogo Web agent-based modeling language and environment. The project will also achieve this outcome by publishing its technology-mediated activities and materials in the public domain and by capturing extensive qualitative and quantitative data on the intensity and nature of use of these technologies and materials. Collectively, the project will foster the growth of educational infrastructures to enable the dissemination and effective adoption of generative teaching and learning in STEM."

This study uses a novel developmental approach to test whether midfacial reduction of the skull in primates is a byproduct of growth of neighboring structures (e.g., eyes and teeth). For example, does selection for a precocious visual nervous system fundamentally affect midfacial patterns of growth? Do proportionately large deciduous maxillary teeth and their successors have transient or lasting effects on development of paranasal spaces of the maxilla? To answer these questions, cadaveric samples from over seventy specimens (including 20 species of primates) will be studied. Specimens of different postnatal ages will be studied using an innovative combination of high-resolution computed tomography (CT) and microscopic study of decalcified samples.  The result is a novel approach for mapping regions of bone deposition and resorption in three dimensions. The project will create unique three-dimensional 'growth maps' of primate skulls in relation to functional units of the head (eyes, nasal airways, teeth). Three-dimensional skull form and growth maps will then be compared among primates that differ in the extent to which the eyes are convergent (forward-facing). Indirect influences on neural and dental development, such as gestation length and diet, will also be used as variables.<br/><br/>The broader implications of the study include a web-based atlas and digital archive of histological and CT images from the specimens. The interactive online atlas will be developed as a resource for anatomists, who will benefit from animal models for aspects of human development, and primatologists, who will benefit from the resource on development of primates. In addition, animations which highlight the importance of growth mechanisms for evolutionary adaptation will be created and made available to advanced K-12 students and their teachers as online educational tools."

This I-Corps team is creating an open source software system to compare scans of 3D printed objects with their digital designs, presenting the results in a visually rich, interactive form on mobile devices. Current offerings focus on expensive proprietary software and hardware, limiting participation and technical contributions by a vibrant and rapidly changing community.

The product will provide a powerful tool for evaluation to small companies, researchers, and members of the growing maker community.<br/><br/>The proposed project adds statistical measures and a workflow derived from X-ray tomography to an existing open source visualization app that runs on handheld tablets and smartphones. The goal is to compare the digital form of the 3D model as sent to the 3D printer with a 3D measurement of the actual printed object as obtained with available scanning technology. A quantitative comparison of a design's digital model with the point-cloud or surface data generated by one of these scans can reveal important qualitative results. The product will display results based on the type and precision of the scanning technology used, such as laser-based metrology scans, X-ray and CT scans, and physical metrology systems. The statistical workflow and visualization software will be tabulated and rendered on a workstation or server, and presented using a version of Kitware's KiwiViewer that the team has customized for the application. The proposed system will be distributed open source, providing quality analysis to growing numbers of small companies, researchers, and artisans, delivered to mobile devices and desktops alike. A vibrant open source community in a rapidly changing field like 3D printing can drive a great deal of technical and market innovation.

Eruptions, besides their obvious associated hazards, are one of the rare expressions of the dynamics of the Earth over timescales that are easy to comprehend from our standpoint. Over the last decades, our community has recognized the importance of exsolved volatiles (gas bubbles) on the chemical and physical evolution of magmas in the shallow crust and on eruption dynamics. The complexity of volcanic processes and our inability to observe directly how magmas evolve prior and during volcanic eruptions has seriously limited our ability to predict the timing and behavior of volcanic eruptions. With this project, we propose the development of new numerical methods, complemented with fluid dynamics experiments to provide a quantitative understanding of how the exsolution of gases affects the physical properties of magmas, their chemistry (and the composition of gases released to the atmosphere) and ultimately how bubbles behave collectively and affect the behavior of magmas erupting at the Earth surface.<br/><br/>Magmas are multiphase systems composed of a very viscous ambient fluid (silicate melt), crystals and sometimes complemented by exsolved (immiscible) gas bubbles. In order to predict how magmas evolve before and during eruptions, we need to develop dynamic models that allow us to accurately represent the interplay between these three phases under various conditions. In this project, we plan to study first the exsolution and growth of water-rich bubbles to model their effect on chemical differentiation, i.e. how secondary gas phases such as sulfur species and CO2 partition into growing bubbles. The amount of sulfur incorporated into bubbles before an eruption is significant to quantify the impact of eruptions on climate (sulfur is a potent aerosol that affects the radiative balance in the atmosphere).  The chemistry of the exsolved gas phase and its participation in a future eruption depend on the efficiency of phase separation in magmas and the possible accumulation of gas bubbles in parts of the reservoir that are more likely to erupt (lower viscosity).  Our second task is to study the physics of phase separation, bubble-crystals-melt, more specifically to understand how the magma motion is impeded or facilitated by the presence of discrete bubbles and crystals.  Finally, once the rheology of multiphase magmas is better constrained, we plan to use these results and study how buoyant gas bubbles migrate in zoned magma reservoirs. The question we aim to answer is whether bubbles are prone to accumulate in regions of low or high crystal content and how this accumulation affects the chemistry of the gas in the bubbles and the eruptive behavior of the magma.<br/><br/>The results of the proposed research will have broad implications for physical volcanology, petrology, geochemistry and fluid dynamics. It will provide quantitative constraints on the state of magmas stored in shallow crustal reservoirs and also provide a better account of the effect of bubbles on magmas as they ascend to the surface during eruptions. Predictive models for the exsolution of sulfur in magmatic systems can also provide clues as to the climate impact of pre-historical large explosive eruptions (e.g. Toba, Cerro Galan). The goal of the proposed research is to provide quantitative tools and constitutive relations that will be widely available to interpret existing datasets (geochemistry of magmas, rheological experiments on magmas) and transfer this new knowledge to models of magma dynamics. Additionally, the development of new numerical methods to study multiphase fluid dynamics will impact the Computational Fluid Dynamics community and other fields in science and engineering, where particle suspensions or bubble emulsions are important (e.g. effect of fluid dynamics on biology, food processing?)<br/>"

The research is supervised by two professors from the Center for Language Science at the Pennsylvania State University. This interdisciplinary research project is an important step toward understanding the commonalities and differences between monolingual and multilingual language processing. Bilingualism has historically been treated as its own separate field, but the current study contributes a unique set of data that can be exploited to better understand the cognitive resources that underlie all language processing. A better understanding of bilingual/multilingual linguistic norms is critical for the development of effective teaching curricula and assessments. In addition, the results of this work have the potential to be useful for diagnostic and treatment materials in a clinical setting.<br/><br/>This research incorporates methods from phonetics, corpus linguistics, cognitive psychology, and cognitive neuroscience to better understand the time course of processes underlying speech production and speech perception. The project uses bilingual language processing as a context that can reveal cognitive mechanisms that are otherwise hidden in monolingual speakers. The specific research questions target the interplay between the neural signature of inhibitory processes, as revealed using Event Related Potentials (ERPs), and the behavioral outcome of that inhibition, as revealed in acoustic measures of speech articulation. The studies take advantage of bilinguals' ability to switch languages mid-sentence. The training component of this project is both theoretical and methodological. The project capitalizes on the Fellow's previous training while simultaneously familiarizing her with the theoretical background necessary to conduct research related to the cognitive psychology of bilingualism, and the methodological training necessary to incorporate neurocognitive and eyetracking methods into her future work. The intellectual merit of the proposed research is its ability to tie together findings from traditionally separate approaches to studying language."

These representations will then be used to analyze, search, and recognize similar objects or features in collections of (scans of) paintings, in particular a large collection by the baroque artist Jan Brueghel. The distances between images and portions thereof, the features learned by the extensions of dictionary learning we will construct, and the associated statistical similarities, together with labels provided by experts to be used to train classifiers and algorithms that learn similarities among items to match those provided by expert, will enable us to enrich the current set of capabilities in building these large networks of paintings, to search through them more easily and with more general search patterns, and to visualize them according to different metrics by using dimensionality reduction techniques.<br/><br/>The automatic learning of templates and patterns, and their statistical relationships, in images and signals in general is crucial in a wide variety of applications, such as automating object recognition, and in defining visually meaningful similarities between images, needed to enable searches in large image databases. We will both develop novel techniques for automatically learning good templates for images, that incorporate natural invariances such as translations and scalings, and novel ways of exploiting these templates for analyzing large collections images, measuring the similarities  between then, and finding and characterizing recurrent patterns in them. These novel techniques will be applied to the data on the Jan Brueghel Research site, that allows scholars to investigate and conceptualize a very different notion of old master pictures. Instead of creating absolute categories of genuine and not-genuine, the team will be drawing a map of interconnections between the thousands of paintings produced in the workshops of early modern Antwerp. These pictures were made over several generations, in the shops of masters ranging from world-famous (Pieter Brueghel, Rubens) to utterly obscure. The website will chart how ideas were generated, exchanged, reused and retooled by different artists, mapping networks of creation and production well beyond those traceable through archival documents."

Children appear to be better at learning new languages than adults, who instead have very mixed outcomes in how well they ultimately learn a new language. For decades, research has attempted to understand why adults experience more difficulty in learning new languages and what characterizes good language learners compared to less successful language learners, so that we can use this information to improve teaching methods. From this research, we have learned how certain factors contribute to the outcomes in new language learning, but much of the variability remains unaccounted for, suggesting that there is still a piece of the puzzle missing. With National Science Foundation support, Ms. Kinsey Bice, working under the direction of Dr. Judith Kroll, will investigate how individual differences in learning may shape patterns of new second language learning.<br/><br/>The current project will examine how previous language experience combines with general cognitive resources to affect the trajectory of new language learning. Previous research has identified differences in the way that the native language is processed that may contribute to the trajectory of new language learning (i.e., fast and slow language learners), and that may also be affected by how speakers recruit various aspects of cognition (e.g., working memory, pattern abstraction) when processing their native language. This project will examine how these differences in skilled language processing predict the trajectory of new language learning, as well as whether the differences are related to variation in non-language abilities. Bilingual speakers, who already have experience with learning a new language and who do not use either language exactly as monolingual speakers do, have previously been found to be better at acquiring new languages, but bilinguals differ from each other in many ways that affect their language learning outcomes. This project will compare both monolingual and bilingual speakers in how they process their skilled languages and how they learn new languages. Behavioral methods and brain potentials will be used to determine whether the brain reflects some learning processes that are not apparent in behavior alone. The bilinguals tested will be typical college students who are taking advanced foreign language classes, as well as heritage Spanish speakers who are raised in Spanish-speaking homes but then educated in English. These two groups of bilinguals represent language experiences that American citizens often encounter themselves, while the monolingual groups will be recruited from parts of the United States that differ in the levels of ambient exposure to foreign languages."

The resilience between dynamics of human and engineered systems is often challenged by small wrinkles in the motifs of human geography that may shift the timing and geography of populations and infrastructure off-normal. For example, delayed starts to the workday because of winter weather can bump peak commuting off-rhythm, delay the logistics of citywide delivery systems, or produce bursts in communications activity. While these may form as small local shifts from normal in particular places and times, they can transfer, diffuse, and adapt with unforeseen consequences and serious impacts on broader phenomena as diverse as commuting, the labor market, logistics, and urban management. Understanding how these dynamics arise, form, and spread through increasingly connected systems, as well as measuring and modeling them is critical if we are to plan for them, mitigate them, and manage them. Building this understanding requires an interdisciplinary approach that bridges engineering, informatics and computing, and the socio-behavioral sciences: a multipronged challenge that is indicative of the problems that a next-generation of students and engineers will face in designing, constructing, maintaining, and managing urban systems that are increasingly intertwined with, dependent upon, and adapting to the shifting and ever-evolving patterns of our activities. Similarly, getting the right data, metrics, and models to diverse groups of urban managers, engineers, and the public-at-large in ways that can usefully inform their understanding of interdependency will be critical in fashioning systems that can better weather such challenges. <br/><br/>A starting point in investigating these connections is to explore conventional sources of data on human geography, but to also develop extensible systems that can use newly-forming data from location-aware technologies that produce rapid snapshots of whole populations in the messy context and complexity of everyday urban life. Novel analyses on these data can produce dynamically-evolving atlases and censuses of interdependency, from which motifs of behavior can be extracted and resolved, as land-use, activity, mobility, and sociality. These motifs can inform computer models designed to explore what-if dynamics between people, place, process, and infrastructure, that better frame and describe interdependency in activity, movement, access, and information. To assist in translating this research into the public domain, the project will formalize several outputs: a set of reusable data and model outputs accessible via a community Web portal, a pilot demonstration for winter weather scenarios in Washington DC that will fully explore scenarios of interdependency between human geography and mobile transport and communications infrastructure, and a set of code libraries for use in allied model systems. Through application to substantive issues of relevance in geography, informatics, and engineering, these outputs will enable other communities to apply and adapt these methods to their cities, data, and infrastructure."
